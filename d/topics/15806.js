In an SBO, air, fluid, and food get stuck in the intestine. They can't move through the small intestine the way they normally would. </p><p>The intestine can be partly or completely blocked in an SBO. A complete block can lead to serious problems. That's because:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The intestine can get swollen from the trapped air, fluid, and food. This swelling can make the intestine less able to absorb fluid, which can lead to dehydration and kidney failure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the intestine wall tears, the fluid in the intestine can leak out. This can cause a belly infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the intestine is blocked, the blood vessels that bring oxygen to the intestine can get blocked, too. Without blood, parts of the intestine can die.</p><p/><p>In some cases, the small intestine looks blocked on tests even when it isn't. This could be from either intestinal &quot;ileus&quot; or &quot;pseudo-obstruction.&quot; This article is only about real obstruction. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25520069\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes an SBO?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common causes of an SBO are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Past surgery in the belly &ndash; After surgery, scar tissue can form in the belly and press on the intestine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hernias &ndash; A hernia is an opening in the muscle or tissue that covers the muscle. Part of the intestine can get trapped and stuck in a hernia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Twisting of the intestines</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tumor &ndash; Tumors (cancerous and noncancerous) can grow inside or outside the intestine and block it.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25520084\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of an SBO?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms depend on where your intestine is blocked and how blocked it is. The most common symptoms are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea and vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belly pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belly swelling and bloating</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not being able to have a bowel movement or pass gas</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25520099\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and do an exam. If your doctor thinks that you have an SBO, he or she will do imaging tests of your belly and chest and blood tests. </p><p>The imaging tests can include an X-ray, CT scan, or a series of X-rays called a &quot;GI series.&quot; For the CT scan and GI series, you will drink a liquid called &quot;contrast&quot; beforehand. The contrast will show up on the CT scan or X-rays. It can help the doctor see what's causing the blockage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25520114\"><span class=\"h1\">How is an SBO treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on the blockage and your symptoms.</p><p>If you have an SBO, you will be treated in the hospital. Your doctor will give you fluids and medicines. You will also get a nasogastric tube. This is a thin tube that goes in your nose, down your esophagus, and into your stomach. The tube can suck up the fluid and air in your stomach. This will make your stomach feel better and help keep you from vomiting.</p><p>Many people will not need any other treatment. That's because, many times, an SBO can get better on its own. This is often the case for a partial SBO, or an SBO that has happened after earlier belly surgery.</p><p>Some people will need surgery. You are likely to need surgery if you have a hernia, you have never had surgery before, you have a complete blockage, or your SBO does not get better with fluids and the nasogastric tube.</p><p>During surgery, your doctor will remove the blockage and any unhealthy parts of your small intestine. After your doctor removes the unhealthy intestine, he or she will usually reconnect your intestines so they work normally. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25520128\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=inguinal-and-femoral-groin-hernias-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Inguinal and femoral (groin) hernias (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colostomy-care-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Colostomy care (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=intussusception-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Intussusception (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
