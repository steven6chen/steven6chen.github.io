Standard endoscopic imaging provides little detail of the mucosal surface making it impossible to distinguish specialized intestinal epithelium from gastric-type metaplasia or to recognize dysplastic epithelium.</p><p>Better imaging modalities have the potential to improve detection of Barrett's esophagus and surveillance for dysplasia and cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-evaluation-with-narrow-band-imaging/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Many new endoscopic techniques continue to be developed including magnification endoscopy, chromoendoscopy, optical coherence tomography, confocal endomicroscopy, narrow band imaging, and autofluorescence endoscopy, but none is used routinely in clinical practice. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnification-endoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Magnification endoscopy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chromoendoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chromoendoscopy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=optical-coherence-tomography-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Optical coherence tomography in the gastrointestinal tract&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=confocal-laser-endomicroscopy-and-endocytoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Confocal laser endomicroscopy and endocytoscopy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barretts-esophagus-evaluation-with-autofluorescence-endoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Barrett's esophagus: Evaluation with autofluorescence endoscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic review will summarize the experience with narrow band imaging. General approaches to diagnosis and management of Barrett's esophagus are discussed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barretts-esophagus-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Barrett's esophagus: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Barrett's esophagus: Surveillance and management&quot;</a>). Also see appropriate topic reviews for issues related to optical coherence tomography, autofluorescence and magnification endoscopy, and chromoendoscopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Narrow band imaging (NBI) is a high-resolution endoscopic technique that enhances the fine structure of the mucosal surface without the use of dyes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F50844\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50844 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F62625\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62625 \">picture 2</a>). NBI is based upon the phenomenon that the depth of light penetration depends on its wavelength; the longer the wavelength, the deeper the penetration. Blue light penetrates only superficially, whereas red light penetrates into deeper layers.</p><p>The first prototype NBI system (Olympus Corp, Tokyo, Japan) is based upon a light source with sequential red-green-and-blue (RGB) illumination. White light from a Xenon lamp is passed through a rotary RGB filter that separates the white light into the colors red, green, and blue, which are used to sequentially illuminate the mucosa. The red, green, and blue reflected light is detected separately by a monochromatic charged coupled device (CCD) placed at the tip of the endoscope, and the three images are integrated into a single color image by the video processor. In addition to the conventional RGB filters for white light endoscopy (WLE), the narrow band imaging system has special RGB filters of which the bandpass ranges have been narrowed and the relative contribution of blue light has been increased. This RGB-based NBI system is commercially available in Japan and the United Kingdom. In other parts of the world, the endoscopy systems are not based on RGB illumination but use white light illumination in combination with a color CCD-chip. NBI systems are commercially available for these endoscopy systems as well.</p><p>For both NBI systems, the NBI filters can be manually enabled and disabled during endoscopy, making it easy to switch between the standard mode and the NBI-mode. NBI enables better visualization of the mucosal patterns because blue light allows for optimal superficial imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-evaluation-with-narrow-band-imaging/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, NBI reveals the superficial vasculature because of absorption of the blue light by hemoglobin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-evaluation-with-narrow-band-imaging/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>NBI has several advantages compared with chromoendoscopy: (1) no staining agents are required; (2) it is user-friendly; (3) it allows for inspection of the whole endoscopic field, whereas in chromoendoscopy, the dye often does not distribute equally over the mucosa. In addition to these practical advantages, NBI reveals the superficial vasculature with a high contrast, whereas the vascular pattern is often less visible in chromoendoscopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL UTILITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial reports suggested that narrow band imaging (NBI) can be useful for detailed inspection of the mucosal pattern characteristics of different gastrointestinal pathology including Barrett's esophagus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-evaluation-with-narrow-band-imaging/abstract/3-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-11</a>]. Several studies have described characteristic patterns in patients with Barrett's esophagus using NBI. The following are illustrative of the largest prospective studies.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study involved a systematic image and biopsy evaluation of almost 200 randomly selected areas in 63 patients with Barrett's esophagus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-evaluation-with-narrow-band-imaging/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A regular mucosal and vascular pattern and a flat mucosa (ie, without any villi or pits) were significantly associated with specialized intestinal metaplasia, while all areas with high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN) exhibited at least irregular mucosal patterns, irregular vascular patterns, or abnormal blood vessels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another group proposed a classification system based upon the results of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indigo-carmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indigo carmine</a> staining and NBI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-evaluation-with-narrow-band-imaging/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. The authors described three categories for mucosal patterns <span class=\"nowrap\">(ridged/villous,</span> circular, and <span class=\"nowrap\">irregular/distorted)</span> and two categories for vascular patterns (normal and abnormal). Prospective evaluation of 51 patients using this classification system found that the <span class=\"nowrap\">ridge/villous</span> pattern had a sensitivity of 94 percent for detecting intestinal metaplasia while the <span class=\"nowrap\">irregular/distorted</span> pattern had sensitivity of 100 percent for HGIN.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A third classification system was based upon two regular microstructural patterns <span class=\"nowrap\">(linear/tubular/villous</span> type and round type), an irregular microstructural pattern (IMSP), an absent microstructural pattern (AMSP), a regular microvascular patterns (RMVP), and an irregular microvascular patterns (IMVP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-evaluation-with-narrow-band-imaging/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In a prospective evaluation in 50 patients, the regular microstructural pattern of the <span class=\"nowrap\">linear/tubular/villous</span> type <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> RMVP with AMSP had a sensitivity of 100 percent for intestinal metaplasia. Five of the six patients with HGIN showed IMVP or IMSP.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a subsequent study from the same group, a simplified classification system was proposed consisting of four different types of patterns: (A) round pits with regular microvasculature, (B) <span class=\"nowrap\">villous/ridge</span> pits with regular microvasculature, (C) absent pits with regular microvasculature, (D) distorted pits with irregular microvasculature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-evaluation-with-narrow-band-imaging/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. When evaluated in 109 patients with established Barrett's esophagus, the positive and negative predictive values for the different types were 100 and 97 percent for type A, 88 and 91 percent for types B and C, respectively, and 81 and 99 percent for type D, respectively, with good inter- and intraobserver agreement among non-expert and expert endoscopists.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective controlled trial comparing NBI with standard endoscopy found that NBI detected significantly more patients with dysplasia and higher grades of dysplasia with fewer biopsy samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-evaluation-with-narrow-band-imaging/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Due to the tandem-endoscopy design of this study, the question remains whether the improved detection rate of the <span class=\"nowrap\">HDTV/NBI</span> procedure can be attributed to a more thorough inspection by more experienced endoscopists, a better quality white light endoscopy, or the use of NBI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-evaluation-with-narrow-band-imaging/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p>Although these studies have shown promising results for NBI in detection of intestinal metaplasia and HGIN, all were performed by experts in single centers <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> involved relatively small numbers of patients. By contrast, a study comparing NBI, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indigo-carmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indigo carmine</a> chromoendoscopy, and acetic acid chromoendoscopy found no benefit from the enhanced imaging methods in identifying early neoplasia in Barrett's esophagus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-evaluation-with-narrow-band-imaging/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Furthermore, the enhanced methods did not improve interobserver agreement. Similar conclusions regarding poor interobserver agreement have been reached in other reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-evaluation-with-narrow-band-imaging/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].</p><p>A meta-analysis of eight studies including 446 patients and 2194 lesions found that the pooled sensitivity and specificity of NBI for detecting Barrett's mucosa were 95 and 65 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-evaluation-with-narrow-band-imaging/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The sensitivity and specificity for the detection of high-grade dysplasia were 96 and 94 percent. These findings suggest that NBI is useful for the detection of Barrett's mucosa and high-grade dysplasia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Narrow band imaging (NBI) is an imaging technique that (like magnification and chromoendoscopy) shows promise for detailed evaluation of suspicious mucosal abnormalities in Barrett's esophagus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NBI requires no special dyes, is operator-friendly, and allows for inspection of the superficial vascular bed, which may not be possible with chromoendoscopy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The combination of the mucosal and vascular pattern may eventually prove to be an accurate endoscopic tool that can help target biopsies to areas with suspicious superficial morphology.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although NBI is already commercially available, the classification of mucosal and vascular patterns with NBI is not yet standardized and validated. Thus, additional studies are needed before it can be incorporated into routine clinical practice.</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-evaluation-with-narrow-band-imaging/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Qumseya BJ, Wang H, Badie N, et al.
