While the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-KDQOI) clinical practice guidelines prioritize the creation of AV fistulas over AV grafts and suggest a goal prevalent rate for native AV fistulas of 65 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], for certain populations, an AV graft may be an appropriate choice as initial hemodialysis access, or for secondary access if an AV fistula has failed to develop. </p><p>The creation of AV grafts for hemodialysis and their complications are reviewed here. An overview of the different types of chronic hemodialysis access and creation of AV fistulas for hemodialysis are presented separately.

The main benefit of AV grafts is that they do not require maturation, as AV fistulas do, and that they can be used for hemodialysis in as little as 24 hours after creation depending upon the type of graft that is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Prosthetic grafts are widely available off-the-shelf, have a long shelf life, and generally do not require special handling. </p><p>AV grafts can be created with minimal patient morbidity. The surgical procedure is relatively straightforward and generally can be quickly accomplished under local anesthesia with or without sedation. Prosthetic grafts are also easily palpable when placed subcutaneously and are easily punctured for hemodialysis. </p><p>On the other hand, AV grafts generally possess other less desirable characteristics.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, AV grafts have shorter patency compared with AV fistulas. This is particularly true in younger dialysis populations. However, a patency discrepancy has not been consistently found. Data from the Dialysis Morbidity and Mortality Study (DMMS) found no patency advantage for AV fistulas compared with AV grafts in older adults (&gt;65 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Also, a study from the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) linked with Medicare claims showed that in incident hemodialysis patients aged &ge;67 years, there was no significant mortality difference between patients who had an AV graft placed as first access compared with those who had an AV fistula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The AV graft is a high-flow, low-resistance system that can result in a steal phenomenon in the distal extremity, also termed dialysis access-associated steal syndrome (DASS), and other complications related to the increased flow into the venous system (eg, heart failure, pulmonary hypertension). The onset of these problems after AV grafts is more common in the acute postoperative period since the AV graft serves as a large-diameter circuit as soon as it is opened [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Certain patient characteristics, comorbidities, and even community factors increase the risk for AV fistula failure, such as inadequate anatomy (smaller arterial diameter, small draining vein), obesity, advancing age, and female gender.<strong> </strong>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-access\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of chronic hemodialysis vascular access&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1382446118\"><span class=\"h2\">Requirements for AV graft use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The requirements for an AV graft are similar to those of an AV fistula, except that an AV graft does not require maturation (see <a href=\"#H4009232110\" class=\"local\">'Timing of AV graft creation'</a> below). These include the following, which are discussed in more detail elsewhere: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The AV graft must be accessible with the patient in a sitting position.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the forearm, the AV graft should be on the volar surface.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the upper arm, the AV graft should be on the anterior or lateral surface.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The AV graft must be able to be reliably cannulated repeatedly.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The AV graft should be within 1 cm of the skin surface.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A relatively straight segment needs to be available for cannulation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood flow must be adequate to support the dialysis prescription.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For AV grafts, needles need to be placed 3 cm apart and access sites need to be able to be rotated. Ideally, there should be a 6- to 8-cm straight segment of AV graft for this purpose. Adequate blood flow for an AV graft generally means a minimum flow rate in the range of 600 to 700 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute</span>. The actual flow in an AV graft can vary widely based upon where it is placed. Grafts with radial or ulnar inflow have lower flow rates than grafts with brachial or axillary inflow. Tapered grafts limit the inflow, and for this reason they are usually used with brachial or axillary inflow and not in radial or ulnar inflow. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1985040682\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION AND PLANNING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3018712793\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An adequate evaluation of the predialysis patient with chronic kidney disease enhances the opportunity to place a functioning arteriovenous (AV) access. The anatomic requirements for hemodialysis AV access and the evaluation of the patient for placement of hemodialysis arteriovenous access are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-evaluation-and-vascular-mapping-prior-to-placement-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient evaluation and vascular mapping prior to placement of hemodialysis arteriovenous access&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4009232110\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing of AV graft creation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to AV fistulas, AV grafts do not require maturation time, and, depending on the type of conduit used, AV grafts can be accessed in as little as 24 hours for dialysis. Because AV grafts also have shorter patency and increased risk of infection, there is a marked disadvantage to creating an AV graft that is not going to be used. As such, AV grafts should be created when it is certain that the patient will be starting hemodialysis within a very short period of time (ie, two to four weeks). This will allow for tissue ingrowth and resolution of surgical <span class=\"nowrap\">inflammation/edema</span> if a traditional expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) graft is used. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1400644639\"><span class=\"h2\">Anatomic location and configuration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AV grafts should be referred to using anatomical designations that describe their inflow artery, outflow vein, graft material, and graft configuration. Virtually any patent artery can be used as the inflow for an AV graft, and any patent vein can be used as the outflow. Common graft locations are looped forearm (brachial artery to cephalic vein), straight forearm (radial artery to cephalic vein), looped upper arm (axillary artery to axillary vein), and straight upper arm (brachial artery to axillary vein). Lower extremity grafts, looped chest grafts, axillary-axillary (necklace) grafts, and axillary-atrial grafts have also been constructed but are uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1549734238\"><span class=\"h3\">Forearm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common configuration for AV grafts in the forearm is the loop configuration with arterial inflow from the antecubital brachial artery and outflow through the median antecubital vein, cephalic vein, brachial vein, or basilic vein. The radial or ulnar artery can also be used as inflow to any of the aforementioned outflow veins. The graft can be configured straight when using the distal radial or ulnar artery as inflow, and the graft can be configured in a loop when using the proximal radial or ulnar artery as inflow. There are little data to support the use of one configuration over the other. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2252154456\"><span class=\"h3\">Upper arm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common configuration for AV grafts in the upper arm is straight, using inflow from the antecubital brachial artery to axillary vein outflow. The graft can also be configured as a loop using the proximal brachial artery as inflow. The cephalic, basilic, and brachial veins can be used as outflow as well. Again, there are little data to support the use of one configuration over the other. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H994532484\"><span class=\"h3\">Chest</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common configuration for chest AV grafts is an axillary artery to contralateral axillary vein or &quot;necklace&quot; graft. Chest AV grafts can also be constructed as a loop from the axillary artery to the ipsilateral axillary vein. Published studies describing outcomes of chest wall grafts have small sample sizes, but, in the available data, the patencies of loop grafts and necklace grafts appear to be comparable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Some authors have reported that in their experience with the loop configuration, they received a number of complaints from dialysis nurses regarding difficulty in accessing the graft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The same authors also use the axillary loop as a rescue procedure for an occluded necklace graft. Others have stated that they have received no complaints about accessing the loop configuration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2185710579\"><span class=\"h3\">Lower extremity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the lower extremity, AV grafts are most commonly constructed in a loop configuration either in the upper thigh or the mid-thigh. In the upper thigh, the common femoral or superficial femoral artery is used for inflow, and the femoral vein or saphenous vein is used for outflow. In the mid-thigh, the superficial femoral artery supplies the inflow, and the femoral vein is used for outflow. A systematic review of lower extremity access found that the primary and secondary patency rates of upper-thigh and mid-thigh grafts were comparable at one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H132838258\"><span class=\"h3\">Atypical locations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When all of the typical anatomic access sites have been exhausted, cases of AV grafts being created in atypical anatomic configurations have been reported. Some examples include the axillary artery to right atrium in a patient with central venous occlusion, the axillary artery to common iliac vein in a patient with occluded thoracic central veins and inadequate femoral veins, and the brachial artery to jugular vein in patients with exhausted upper-arm superficial veins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H732432756\"><span class=\"h2\">Order of AV graft preference</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>According to National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-KDQOI) Clinical Practice Guidelines, the preferred AV graft site types are the antecubital forearm loop graft and the upper-arm curved graft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The guidelines encourage preserving more proximal sites for new access creation. Chest wall grafts or lower extremity grafts should be considered when all upper extremity sites are exhausted. </p><p>Similar to AV fistulas, in planning the creation of an AV graft, attention should be directed to the nondominant arm first. While the patient is on dialysis, having the dominant hand free allows the patient to engage in desired activities more easily. </p><p>Once upper extremity sites are exhausted, the decision regarding which type of access to create next can be challenging. While it is widely accepted that the incidence of infection of thigh grafts is higher compared with upper extremity grafts, up to 35 percent in some series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], relative to the option of a tunneled catheter, infection rates with a thigh graft are lower [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Another option for patients with end-stage vascular access is the chest wall graft. Chest wall grafts have lower infection rates compared with thigh grafts or tunneled catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>For patients with no upper extremity options due to thoracic central venous <span class=\"nowrap\">stenosis/occlusion,</span> whether to choose a Hemodialysis Reliable Outflow (HeRO) or thigh graft first is unclear (see <a href=\"#H3439238025\" class=\"local\">'HeRO grafts'</a> below). There are data both in support and against HeRO over a thigh graft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Furthermore, it is unclear if the rate of infection between the two differs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. It does seem clear that the HeRO graft extends the use of the upper extremity and preserves the thigh for future use. It has been suggested that the HeRO be considered first in younger, healthier patients with longer life expectancies and that the thigh graft be considered first in older patients with shorter life expectancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. A decision analysis comparing HeRO, tunneled catheter, or thigh graft, which took into account infection, thrombosis, and ischemic events, found that HeRO was the least costly method of vascular access option in this circumstance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H928320587\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF AV GRAFTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Numerous prosthetic and biologic graft materials are available for arteriovenous (AV) graft creation. AV grafts are typically made of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) with a diameter of typically 6 mm (range: 4 to 8 mm). AV grafts can also be constructed from biologic materials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>]. The AV graft can be straight or looped. Prosthetic graft designs include those that are tapered (8 mm on one end, 4 mm on the other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]), thinner-walled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], or reinforced with rings for added support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Data demonstrating clear superiority in performance of one graft material over another do not exist. In choosing graft material, consideration should be made for the timing in which the graft will need to be accessed for dialysis, the presence <span class=\"nowrap\">of/risk</span> for infection, the experience of the surgeon, and cost. </p><p>The upper extremity is the most common location for an AV graft; however, an AV graft can be created between virtually any arterial inflow and venous outflow. The most common graft material used for AV grafts is polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE); however, numerous prosthetic, xenograft, and homograft materials have also been used. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H214091438\"><span class=\"h2\">Prosthetic grafts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most commonly used prosthetic material for AV grafts is ePTFE. Most surgeons have abandoned Dacron as a graft material for AV grafts due to poor patency, issues with bleeding, and poor wall integrity. ePTFE grafts have undergone various modifications to improve their performance. Unfortunately, the outcomes for ePTFE AV grafts remain somewhat dismal. A meta-analysis demonstrated a primary patency at two years for AV grafts of 40 percent and a secondary patency of 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3793221064\"><span class=\"h3\">Standard versus thin-walled</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ePTFE grafts are available in a standard thickness (0.64 mm) and a thin-wall version (0.37 mm). The thin-wall configuration is more flexible and hence somewhat easier to handle. The data to support one configuration being superior to another are minimal. One study (performed early when the thin-wall configuration was first introduced) randomly assigned 108 patients to standard-wall or thin-wall AV grafts. The standard thickness group demonstrated significantly longer mean primary patency (18.2 versus 12.1 months), secondary patency (20.9 versus 13.7 months), and cumulative patency (22.2 versus 15.2 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1747148015\"><span class=\"h3\">Heparin-bonded grafts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Luminal surface heparin-bonded ePTFE was introduced in 2006. A 2016 review of heparin-bonded ePTFE for hemodialysis access identified five studies evaluating heparin-bonded grafts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The first two retrospective studies that were performed demonstrated significantly higher patency in the heparin-bonded group compared with the conventional group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Subsequently, two additional retrospective studies found no significant difference in patency between the two groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. One trial involving 160 patients showed a nonsignificant trend toward improved patency for heparin-bonded grafts, which had a significantly lower early thrombosis rate that was sustained only for the first five months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p>Although the benefits of using heparin-bonded grafts are not well supported, the risk of using a heparin-bonded graft is overall low. The risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is less than 0.1 percent in over 130,000 implanted grafts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

External support is thought to provide resistance to kinking and incompressibility. While externally supported grafts are not commonly used for AV grafts in the United States (US), largely due to concerns surrounding puncturing the graft and posthemodialysis hemostasis, there are reports of externally supported grafts having good success with no difficulty in puncture or hemostasis in other geographic regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p>A large retrospective study performed at a non-US institution found significantly higher one-, two-, and three-year patency for externally supported AV grafts compared with nonsupported AV grafts (49.4 versus 31.9 percent, 31.6 versus 17.4 percent, and 20.2 versus 10.8 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2420817767\"><span class=\"h3\">Early cannulation grafts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Standard ePTFE grafts typically require two to three weeks of tissue ingrowth prior to puncture to reduce the incidence of puncture site bleeding and hematoma.

The intent of the HeRO graft is to provide outflow for patients with central venous stenosis or occlusion. The HeRO is generally considered one of the options of last resort for patients who have exhausted conventional upper extremity AV fistula and AV graft sites. </p><p>The ePTFE graft is anastomosed proximally to the brachial artery or other inflow artery. The distal end of the ePTFE graft is then connected to the outflow catheter, which enters the central venous circulation through the internal jugular vein, subclavian vein, or other vein that provides access into the central venous system. The distal tip of the catheter is positioned in the mid- to upper right atrium. The ePTFE portion of the HeRO graft requires a few weeks for tissue ingrowth prior to puncture, just as any other standard ePTFE graft. Modifications have been described where an early access graft is used in place of the standard ePTFE graft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

Severe ischemic symptoms, characterized by loss of sensation or weakness, may be more common among patients with diabetes and those of advanced age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/17,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,67</a>]. Less severe symptoms and signs, such as paresthesias and a sense of coolness with retained pulses, are more common and usually improve over a period of weeks with the development of collateral blood flow. Careful, frequent clinical evaluation and an alert nursing staff are necessary in this setting. Symptoms often worsen during dialysis sessions. </p><p>Physical examination can confirm a diagnosis of vascular steal by manually compressing the access and noting an improvement in the patient's symptoms. However, physical examination alone may not be accurate in identifying the anatomic cause of the vascular steal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. Thus, among patients presenting with symptoms of extremity ischemia, there should be a low threshold to obtain noninvasive vascular evaluation using duplex ultrasound, which may identify the presence of arterial stenosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> flow reversal, and physiologic tests such as digital waveforms and pressures with and without fistula compression, which are sensitive for a diagnosis of steal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/90-92\" class=\"abstract_t\">90-92</a>]. If noninvasive studies are unrevealing and ischemic symptoms persist, arteriography of the extremity may identify an anatomic problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. </p><p>Severe or persistent ischemic symptoms warrant treatment to prevent the development of permanent injury. If revascularization is not possible, the AV graft will require ligation. Percutaneous catheter-based intervention may be an option in patients with inflow arterial stenosis or progressive arterial occlusive disease in the extremity distal to the arteriovenous anastomosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/89,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">89,93</a>]. If surgical intervention is required and preservation of the AV graft is a high priority, the procedure with the longest history and that has been most studied is the Distal Revascularization-Interval Ligation (DRIL) procedure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F76970\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76970 \">figure 1</a>). With this procedure, the artery is ligated distal to the anastomosis to prevent retrograde flow and persistent steal, and perfusion to the hand is restored with a distal bypass procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/94-102\" class=\"abstract_t\">94-102</a>]. The ligation and bypass procedures can be performed at a single surgery; staged procedures are rarely needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/96,97\" class=\"abstract_t\">96,97</a>]. Other surgical interventions that avoid having distal perfusion dependent upon the bypass graft include the Proximalization of Arterial Inflow (PAI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>], Revision Using Distal Inflow (RUDI), and the Minimally Invasive Limited Ligation Endoluminal-assisted Revision (MILLER) procedures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F76970\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76970 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/104,105\" class=\"abstract_t\">104,105</a>]. There are few direct comparisons between these procedures. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2344578381\"><span class=\"h4\">Ischemic monomelic neuropathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ischemic monomelic neuropathy (IMN) is a rare complication that is likely in the spectrum of ischemic steal but has distinct characteristics from the typical presentation. The incidence of IMN is difficult to determine from the literature but is in the range of less than 1 percent of vascular access creations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. IMN is characterized by immediate onset after the vascular access operation and is significantly more likely to occur in patients who have AV access creation with brachial artery inflow. In contrast to typical steal, patients with IMN have profound motor and sensory deficits without other associated manifestations of tissue ischemia such as tissue loss. Electromyography performed on patients with IMN demonstrates signs of acute denervation, which can result in permanent neurologic damage. The treatment for IMN is immediate ligation of the vascular access [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H437954476\"><span class=\"h2\">AV graft dysfunction and failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AV graft dysfunction and failure related to stenotic vascular lesions is the most common complication of AV grafts. This issue is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-dysfunction-and-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemodialysis arteriovenous graft dysfunction and failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3129960180\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All arteriovenous (AV) grafts possess similar characteristics. These generally include very low patient morbidity related to the procedure for most types of AV graft but higher rates of venous outflow stenosis, leading to lower patency rates, and an increased rate of infection compared with AV fistulas. (See <a href=\"#H2517954488\" class=\"local\">'General characteristics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who require a chronic hemodialysis vascular access, an AV graft may be an appropriate choice as initial hemodialysis access (rather than an AV fistula), or as a secondary access if an AV fistula has failed to develop. (See <a href=\"#H1094059011\" class=\"local\">'Candidates for AV grafts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To be usable, the AV graft must provide adequate blood flow, be reliably cannulated, and be accessible in a seated position. (See <a href=\"#H1382446118\" class=\"local\">'Requirements for AV graft use'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adequate preoperative evaluation prior to AV graft creation includes a history, physical examination, and arterial and venous evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H3018712793\" class=\"local\">'Physical evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Numerous prosthetic and biologic graft materials are available for AV graft creation. AV grafts should be referred to using anatomical designations that include the donor artery and outflow in their description and the type of conduit used. Data demonstrating clear superiority in performance of one graft material over another do not exist. In choosing graft material, consideration should be made for the timing in which the graft will need to be accessed for dialysis, the presence <span class=\"nowrap\">of/risk</span> for infection, the experience of the surgeon, and cost. (See <a href=\"#H928320587\" class=\"local\">'Types of AV grafts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among the possible AV grafts, we start as distal as possible on the upper extremity and exhaust the use of one upper extremity before moving to the contralateral upper extremity. (See <a href=\"#H732432756\" class=\"local\">'Order of AV graft preference'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications associated with AV grafts include local problems associated with graft creation and use, such as hematoma, seroma, pseudoaneurysm formation, neuropathy, and graft infection. Changes in flow to the extremity can lead to extremity ischemia, and augmented venous return can have detrimental cardiopulmonary effects. (See <a href=\"#H1460532473\" class=\"local\">'Complications of AV graft placement'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">NKF-K/DOQI Clinical practice guidelines for vascular access: update.
