Coughing also helps keep people from breathing things into the airways and lungs that could cause problems (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F56535\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56535 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>It is normal for children to cough once in a while. But sometimes, a cough is a symptom of an illness or condition.</p><p>Coughs are called &quot;dry&quot; if they don't bring up mucus, and &quot;wet&quot; if they do. The sound of your child's cough can be different depending on if it is wet or dry. Some coughs are mild, but others are severe. A severe cough can make it hard to breathe.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7868670\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes a cough?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common causes of a cough in children are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infections of the airways or lungs (including the common cold)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having an object stuck in an airway</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asthma &ndash; This is a lung condition that can make it hard to breathe.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other lung problems, including conditions that some children are born with</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coughing out of habit &ndash; This type of cough usually goes away when a child is sleeping.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7868685\"><span class=\"h1\">Should my child see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See the doctor or nurse right away if your child:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is younger than 4 months old</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is having trouble breathing, has noisy breathing, or is breathing very fast (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F59786\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59786 \">figure 2</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gets a cough after he or she choked on food or another object, even if he or she choked on the object days or weeks ago</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is coughing up blood, or yellow or green mucus</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Refuses to drink anything for a long time</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has a fever and is not acting like him- or herself</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is coughing so hard that he or she vomits</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has had the cough for more than 2 weeks and is not getting any better</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7868700\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my child need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. The doctor or nurse will ask questions about your child's symptoms and examine him or her. He or she might do tests, depending on your child's age and other symptoms. There are different tests doctors can do to see what's causing a cough. The most common ones include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A chest X-ray</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests to check for an infection &ndash; For example, the doctor can use a cotton swab to collect a sample from the inside of your child's nose or throat. Then he or she will do lab tests on the sample.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathing tests &ndash; Breathing tests involve breathing hard into a tube. These tests show how the lungs are working. Most children 6 years old and older are able to do breathing tests.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bronchoscopy &ndash; This is a procedure in which a doctor uses a thin tube with a camera on the end (called a &quot;bronchoscope&quot;) to look inside your child's airways. If the doctor finds an object stuck in your child's airway, he or she can remove it during this procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7868715\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do to help get rid of my child's cough?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your child's cough is from a cold, the croup, or another infection, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have him or her drink lots of fluids.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use a humidifier in his or her bedroom.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sit in the bathroom with him or her while you run hot water in the shower to make steam.</p><p/><p>There are certain things you should <strong>not</strong> do:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do <strong>not</strong> give over-the-counter cough and cold medicines to children, especially if they are younger than 6 years old. Cough and cold medicines are not likely to help, and they can cause serious problems in young children.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do <strong>not</strong> give <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> to children younger than 18 years old. Aspirin can cause a life-threatening condition called Reye syndrome in young people.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7868730\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a cough treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on the cause of your child's cough. For example:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some infections are treated with antibiotic medicines. If an infection is caused by bacteria, doctors can treat it with antibiotics. An infection caused by a virus (such as the common cold) cannot be treated with antibiotics.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asthma is treated with medicines that a child usually breathes into his or her lungs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If your child has an object stuck in his or her airway, the doctor can do bronchoscopy to look for it and remove it.</p><p/><p>Doctors do not usually prescribe medicines that quiet a cough to children. These medicines don't usually work well, and they can have serious side effects in children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7868745\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cough-runny-nose-and-the-common-cold-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cough, runny nose, and the common cold (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-bronchitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Acute bronchitis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Asthma in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pneumonia in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchiolitis-and-rsv-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bronchiolitis (and RSV) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=croup-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Croup (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=whooping-cough-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Whooping cough (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=giving-your-child-over-the-counter-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Giving your child over-the-counter medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=coughing-up-blood-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Coughing up blood (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-symptoms-and-diagnosis-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Asthma symptoms and diagnosis in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchiolitis-and-rsv-in-infants-and-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Bronchiolitis (and RSV) in infants and children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=croup-in-infants-and-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Croup in infants and children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
