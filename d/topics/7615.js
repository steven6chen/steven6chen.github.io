The GI immune system consists of physical barriers, gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), and other lymphoid organs. Components of the GI immune system are discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-food-allergy#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of food allergy&quot;, section on 'The gut immune system'</a>.)</p><p>The GI immune system is constantly exposed to a variety of foreign antigens including those from bacteria, viruses, and parasites, as well as foreign dietary proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrointestinal-manifestations-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A balance between immune responses to harmful micro-organisms and tolerance to nonpathogenic antigens is essential for immune homeostasis in the GI tract, a process that generally favors the development of tolerance. The GI immune system is mainly regulated by T lymphocytes, specifically regulatory T (Treg) cells, which are also responsible for cellular immunity and initiation of antigen-specific immune responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrointestinal-manifestations-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>In addition, dimeric secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA), which is synthesized and secreted in the GI tract (and thus distinct from monomeric serum IgA), plays an active role in the regulation of the GI immune system by inducing tolerance to antigens with insignificant pathogenesis as well as providing protection against invasive micro-organisms. It is possible that dysregulation of IgA could result in inflammatory processes in the GI tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrointestinal-manifestations-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In addition, defects in either humoral or cellular immunity could result in uncontrolled inflammatory processes, damage to the mucosal surface of the GI tract, and increased risk of developing chronic inflammatory, autoimmune, and even malignant disorders.</p><p>Breast milk secretory IgA has specific antibodies to the enteric microbes encountered by the mother (eg, the enteromammary immune system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrointestinal-manifestations-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]), making breast milk feeding crucial to the survival of infants in developing countries.

Dysregulation of the GI immune system may result in inappropriate immune responses that lead to autoimmunity or uncontrolled inflammation. Ineffective immune responses that do not fully clear invading pathogens can further provoke such processes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17382094\"><span class=\"h3\">Celiac disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Celiac disease, also called celiac sprue, is a common autoimmune disorder resulting from inappropriate immune responses to gluten, a protein present in bread and cereals. Celiac disease can be asymptomatic but it may also result in malabsorption and an increased risk of malignancies, most commonly lymphoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations of celiac disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Risk of malignancy and mortality'</a>.)</p><p>The clinical course of classic celiac disease in PID patients, such as that seen in selective immunoglobulin A deficiency (sIgAD), is identical to that in immunocompetent patients. However, diagnosis may be more difficult, as a commonly used screening test is the measurement of IgA antibodies against tissue transglutaminase, which may be falsely negative in patients with low IgA. To avoid this diagnostic pitfall, either serum IgA should be measured as well, or tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin G (IgG) should be measured instead [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrointestinal-manifestations-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].

Patients affected by some types of PID (eg, antibody defects and chronic granulomatous disease [CGD]) are at an increased risk of developing IBD compared with immunocompetent individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrointestinal-manifestations-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p>Most IBD manifestations are GI, including diarrhea, abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, vomiting, and weight loss, although extraintestinal manifestations such as arthralgias, erythema nodosum, digital clubbing, and liver problems are also common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrointestinal-manifestations-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. In some types of PID (eg, common variable immunodeficiency [CVID]), nonspecific colitis may resemble the clinical course of IBD, but not respond to therapy as expected, as discussed later in this review.

Lesions are usually located in the small intestine, but sometimes in the colon and even the stomach. It is more common in children than adults. The presence of NLH in the absence of any other abnormal finding is most probably a normal finding, whereas large lesions, particularly if accompanied by flattened intestinal villi in adult patients, should raise suspicion of an immunodeficiency.</p><p>NLH is histologically marked by mitotically active and hyperplastic germinal centers accompanied by a prominence of mantle cell lymphocytes in lamina propria which may also be observed in superficial submucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrointestinal-manifestations-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. NLH in these patients may lead to GI obstruction as well as a reduction of intestinal surface area due to mucosal flattening, which can lead to malabsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrointestinal-manifestations-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Whether NLH is associated with development of lymphoma is a matter of controversy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrointestinal-manifestations-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>].

This tendency has been attributed to excessive sensitization in response to specific food antigens, as it is seen in hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (HIES) secondary to DOCK8 deficiency and in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS). Defects in mucosal immunity, resulting in abnormal expression of food antigens to the immune system, may also be important, as food allergies and intolerances are common in sIgAD.</p><p>While some studies, mainly from Middle East countries, reported a prevalence of food allergy among PID patients to be as high as about 20 percent, one study from the United States reported a prevalence of about 1.8 percent for food allergy, which was even lower than that in the normal population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrointestinal-manifestations-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, this difference seems to be due to the variations in the different types of PID patients included.

The most common are lymphoma and adenocarcinoma, but liver cancer is also reported. Although the underlying mechanism of malignant transformation is not clearly understood in most cases, several factors could contribute, including Helicobacter pylori infection, impaired gastrin secretion, pernicious anemia, atrophic gastritis, NLH, and long-term use of immunosuppressive agents for the management of autoimmune disorders of the GI tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrointestinal-manifestations-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].

Unfortunately, immunoglobulin is <strong>not </strong>similarly effective for the prevention of gastrointestinal (GI) infections, nor does it appear to reduce the occurrence of noninfectious GI complications.</p><p>One exception to the above generalization is <em>Clostridium difficile</em>-induced colitis, which can be treated and also possibly prevented by immunoglobulin therapy. This is probably because immunoglobulin contains high levels of anti-<em>C. difficile</em> antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrointestinal-manifestations-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/92-94\" class=\"abstract_t\">92-94</a>]. Many patients receiving immunoglobulin also require frequent antibiotic treatment, and they are presumedly at increased risk for <em>C. difficile </em>colitis.

One exception to this statement is chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), in which there is consensus that several specific antimicrobial agents are helpful. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic granulomatous disease: Treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Antimicrobial prophylaxis'</a>.)</p><p>For most patients with PID, a decision on the administration of prophylactic antibiotics must be made on an individual basis, taking into account the most important organisms that cause serious and life-threatening infections, present clinical status of the patient, and the previous history of infections. Antimicrobial prophylaxis for different diseases is reviewed in the specific topic reviews.</p><p>Patients who receive long-term prophylactic regimens should be monitored for the side effects of those specific drugs. The authors and many other experts favor a &quot;rotation&quot; approach to decrease the risk of antimicrobial resistance. This approach involves changing the antibiotic used for prophylaxis every three to six months to another type of antibiotic that covers the same spectrum of organisms, but uses a different mechanism of action. This is discussed elsewhere.

Infections should be treated with appropriate antimicrobial agents based on the culture results. Administration of antibiotics should not be discontinued before assuring the complete clearance of the pathogenic organism. Special attention should be paid to the outcome of past antibiotic administration in the same patient. For the management of infections that need prolonged antibiotic administration, combination antibiotic therapy may be recommended, similar to the approach in patients with secondary immunodeficiencies (eg, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]), although information on the probable influences of <em>these practices</em> on antimicrobial resistance is lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrointestinal-manifestations-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].
