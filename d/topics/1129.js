The overall probability of recurrence in these groups is very low following surgical treatment alone. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intermediate-risk </strong>endometrial cancer includes women with uterine-limited cancer that invades the myometrium (stage IA or IB) or demonstrates occult cervical stromal invasion (stage II). These groups have a higher risk of recurrence than do patients whose tumors are confined to the endometrium (which defines patients with low-risk endometrial cancer).<br/><br/>Among this subgroup, there are other adverse prognostic factors used to stratify women into high and low-intermediate-risk. These include outer one-third myometrial invasion, grade 2 or 3 differentiation, or the presence of lymphovascular invasion within the cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-treatment-of-intermediate-risk-endometrial-cancer#H1596987971\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant treatment of intermediate-risk endometrial cancer&quot;, section on 'Definition of intermediate risk'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>High-risk </strong>endometrial cancer includes women with stage III or higher endometrial cancer, regardless of histology or grade. However, women with a serous (USC) or clear cell (CC) carcinoma are deemed at high risk, regardless of stage. These women are at a high risk of relapse and death. </p><p/><p>Staging evaluations and discussion of the role of the sentinel lymph node biopsy are discussed in detail elsewhere.

These include:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H215731542\"><span class=\"h2\">Lower uterine segment involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with otherwise low-risk disease who have involvement of the lower uterine segment may be at a greater risk for nodal involvement. However, it is not clear if involvement of the lower uterine segment represents an independent risk factor for survival. This topic is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-low-risk-endometrial-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of low-risk endometrial cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H215731098\"><span class=\"h2\">Positive peritoneal cytology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 11 percent of patients undergoing surgical staging have positive peritoneal cytology, most commonly in the setting of advanced (extrauterine) disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-adjuvant-treatment-of-endometrial-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, positive peritoneal cytology is no longer considered in the staging system for endometrial carcinoma to assign tumor (T) stage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113543\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113543 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-adjuvant-treatment-of-endometrial-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Despite this, the prognostic significance of isolated positive peritoneal washings in the absence of extrauterine spread remains controversial, as illustrated in the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2009 systematic review that included over 50 studies reported that the prognosis associated with a positive peritoneal cytology varied according to the presence of other factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-adjuvant-treatment-of-endometrial-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Women with positive peritoneal cytology, but otherwise low-risk disease (grade 1 or 2, myometrial invasion &lt;50 percent, no cervical involvement, no lymphovascular space invasion) had a significantly lower rate of recurrence compared with other women (4.1 versus 32 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>However, a 2012 analysis of 14,704 patients identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry reported that positive peritoneal cytology was an independent predictor of mortality, regardless of histologic subtype, among women with early-stage (stage I to II) endometrial carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-adjuvant-treatment-of-endometrial-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The main results were:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with high-risk factors (eg, grade 3 disease, clear cell or serous histology) were more likely to have positive peritoneal cytology than those without high-risk factors (17.5 versus 7.5 percent, respectively, p &lt;0.0001).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The presence of positive peritoneal cytology predicted significantly poorer survival regardless of histology and tumor grade compared with those with negative cytologic results.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The risk of death was significantly higher among women with positive peritoneal cytology compared with those with negative peritoneal cytology and stage IA disease (hazard ratio [HR] 4.6, 95% CI 3.79-5.66).</p><p/><p>We do not routinely consider peritoneal cytology results by themselves in the formulation of a treatment plan for patients with endometrial cancer and continue to make treatment decisions primarily based on extent of disease (determined at staging) and final pathologic features. We agree with the 2009 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging guidelines for endometrial cancer and report cytology results separately without adjustment to the T-stage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-adjuvant-treatment-of-endometrial-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometrial carcinoma: Pretreatment evaluation, staging, and surgical treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H215731105\"><span class=\"h2\">Older age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Older age has been associated with higher rates of clinical failure and survival in several [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-adjuvant-treatment-of-endometrial-cancer/abstract/6-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-11</a>] (but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-adjuvant-treatment-of-endometrial-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]) studies. The association between age and prognosis can be illustrated by data from the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) protocol 33, in which five-year relative survival rates for women with clinical stage I and II endometrial cancer stratified by age were as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&le;40 years old &ndash; 96 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>41 to 50 years old &ndash; 94 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>51 to 60 years old &ndash; 87 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>61 to 70 years old &ndash; 78 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>71 to 80 years old &ndash; 71 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&ge;80 years old &ndash; 54 percent</p><p/><p>Whether age represents an independent prognostic factor is controversial. Women over the age of 65 have more frequent deep myometrial invasion, high tumor grade, and advanced tumor stage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-adjuvant-treatment-of-endometrial-cancer/abstract/7,12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,12-15</a>]. Furthermore, less aggressive therapy could also account for some of the poor outcomes seen in older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-adjuvant-treatment-of-endometrial-cancer/abstract/12,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14,15</a>]. As noted above, age is used to categorize women with intermediate-risk disease into either a high or low-intermediate risk group, which may influence treatment decisions. However, even when treated in uniform fashion, older women seem to have higher recurrence rates and inferior survival compared with their younger counterparts. (See <a href=\"#H1596994160\" class=\"local\">'Definition of risk based on histology and stage'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H215731963\"><span class=\"h2\">Black women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Race also factors into prognosis. Black women have a consistently poorer outcome than Caucasians, an effect that is incompletely explained by imbalances in psychosocial, clinicopathologic, and treatment factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-adjuvant-treatment-of-endometrial-cancer/abstract/16-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-22</a>]. Some of the racial disparity in survival has been attributed to a lower incidence of good-prognosis (low-grade endometrioid) cancers in blacks and a higher incidence of high-risk (grade 3 and nonendometrioid) tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-adjuvant-treatment-of-endometrial-cancer/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. However, an alternative explanation for the worse survival is provided by emerging data suggesting that at least in uterine serous cancers, blacks have a higher frequency of overexpressed or amplified human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-adjuvant-treatment-of-endometrial-cancer/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p>In contrast to Black women, Asian women appear to have a better survival relative to other populations, an effect that is attributed at least in part to younger age at diagnosis. In data from the SEER of the National Cancer Institute, 1 in 50 Asian women with uterine cancer was diagnosed before age 35 as compared with 1 in 150 white women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-adjuvant-treatment-of-endometrial-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1596994195\"><span class=\"h2\">Molecular prognostic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of molecular factors hold promise for determining the prognostic value of routine surgical and histologic characteristics. These include p53 and p16 overexpression, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) mutations, markers of proliferation, microsatellite instability, tumor expression of estrogen (ER) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> progesterone (PR) receptors, or proteins involved in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase <span class=\"nowrap\">(PI3K)/protein</span> kinase B <span class=\"nowrap\">(AKT)/mechanistic</span> target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-adjuvant-treatment-of-endometrial-cancer/abstract/28-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-41</a>].</p><p>Until more data become available, however, they remain investigational and should not be incorporated into clinical decision-making. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a report of 134 women who underwent complete surgical staging, p53 overexpression and high S phase fraction (&ge;9 percent) in preoperative endometrial curettage specimens were independent, significant, presurgical molecular determinants of outcome. The presence of both factors increased the risk of recurrence sevenfold, and the risk of cancer-related death almost 10-fold when compared with women with neither factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-adjuvant-treatment-of-endometrial-cancer/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The absence of PR expression has been correlated with the presence of lymph node metastases and inferior survival in some reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-adjuvant-treatment-of-endometrial-cancer/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Absence of ER expression appears to have some prognostic value, but less than PR expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-adjuvant-treatment-of-endometrial-cancer/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many series report a more favorable outcome for women whose endometrial cancers arise in the setting of Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer [HNPCC]), but there may be subsets with a poorer prognosis. Within the subgroup of endometrioid endometrial tumors with high-level microsatellite instability (MSI-H), tumors that harbor mutations in the cell cycle checkpoint gene <em>ATR</em> have a significantly worse prognosis than those with a wild-type <em>ATR</em> gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-adjuvant-treatment-of-endometrial-cancer/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

For example, in one report, amplifications of the catalytic subunits of PI3K (<em>PI3KCA</em>) were significantly associated with poorer recurrence-free survival compared with those without amplification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-adjuvant-treatment-of-endometrial-cancer/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Therefore, targeting of this pathway appears to be a promising approach to patients with endometrial cancer.<br/><br/>Strategies directed at targeting aberrations in the <span class=\"nowrap\">PI3K/AKT/mTOR</span> pathway include rapalogs, inhibitors of either PI3K<em> </em>or mTOR<em> </em>individually or together, and inhibition of AKT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-adjuvant-treatment-of-endometrial-cancer/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. However, one retrospective review of patients treated with mTOR inhibitors in phase II studies did not identify a predictive biomarker for sensitivity to mTOR inhibition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-adjuvant-treatment-of-endometrial-cancer/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H824482311\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All women with endometrial cancer should undergo surgical staging, especially if the disease is not suspected to be metastatic. For these women, the treatment approach is based on final pathology and the histologic type of cancer, which are used to define risk (see <a href=\"#H1596994160\" class=\"local\">'Definition of risk based on histology and stage'</a> above):</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H824482409\"><span class=\"h2\">Low-risk endometrial cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women with low-risk endometrial cancer, no adjuvant treatment is indicated following surgery. However, some women may wish to preserve future fertility, despite a biopsy-proven diagnosis of grade 1 endometrial cancer. These patients may be candidates for conservative treatment using progestin therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=megestrol-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">megestrol acetate</a>), although careful selection of appropriate patients is necessary.

However, some clinicians may offer adjuvant chemotherapy (with or without RT) to women with higher-risk intermediate-risk endometrial cancer, although the benefit of this approach is not clear. Therefore, whenever possible, we prefer to offer treatment on clinical trials.
