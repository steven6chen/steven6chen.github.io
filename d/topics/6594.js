It is important to recognize however, that these categories may overlap in some patients (eg, volume overload and pressure overload can be associated with ventricular dysfunction).

Unless specified, ventricular dysfunction implies systolic dysfunction (reduced ventricular contractility). Ventricular diastolic dysfunction implies impaired ventricular filling and noncompliance with abnormally steep pressure-volume relationship resulting in high ventricular filling pressures. Ventricular dysfunction (systolic or diastolic) can occur in children with congenital heart disease (CHD) and in those with structurally normal hearts. Children with CHD may have ventricular dysfunction at presentation, but more commonly develop dysfunction and HF several years (or even decades) following surgical repair of their cardiac defect (ie, &quot;burnt-out&quot; CHD).

In contrast, LV systolic function is usually preserved in children with HCM and restrictive cardiomyopathy; when heart failure occurs in these settings, it is usually due to diastolic dysfunction. HF is rare in children with HCM, as most patients have preserved ventricular function. Patients with HCM who present in infancy with HF symptoms are at high risk of mortality.

It is estimated to affect 12,000 to 35,000 children in the United States each year. (See <a href=\"#H23884829\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H804351820\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The causes of pediatric HF can be divided into the following pathophysiologic categories (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79989\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79989 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H23884815\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology and etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ventricular dysfunction may occur in both patients with a structurally normal heart (eg, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, and complete heart block) and those with complex congenital heart disease (CHD). Although HF in patients with CHD may be present at the time of diagnosis, it is more commonly a long-term complication following surgical cardiac repair. (See <a href=\"#H180717383\" class=\"local\">'Ventricular dysfunction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Volume overload with preserved ventricular contractility is most commonly due to CHD with significant left-to-right shunting of blood from the systemic to pulmonary circulation. (See <a href=\"#H23884808\" class=\"local\">'Volume overload with preserved ventricular contractility'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pressure overload with preserved ventricular contractility is most commonly due to CHD with ventricular outflow obstruction. (See <a href=\"#H23884801\" class=\"local\">'Pressure overload with preserved ventricular contractility'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Categorization of the stage and severity of the patient's HF is important for monitoring the disease progression and guiding management decisions. The staging system of pediatric HF (stages A to D) is used to describe the development and progression of disease following exposure to a risk factor for HF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60553\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60553 \">table 3</a>). The New York Heart Association (NYHA) class is most commonly used to quantify the degree of functional limitation imposed by HF in adults and may be used in adolescents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74339\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74339 \">table 4</a>). The Ross HF classification is an adaptation of the NYHA system that is used to describe HF severity in infants and children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74339\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74339 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H23884787\" class=\"local\">'Staging and severity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms and physical findings reflect a limited ability to adequately increase cardiac output (eg, exercise intolerance, easy fatigue, or gastrointestinal symptoms), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pulmonary (eg, respiratory distress with tachypnea) or systemic (eg, hepatomegaly) fluid overload. Clinical features vary with age at presentation. (See <a href=\"#H23884780\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of HF in children is based on a combination of clinical, radiographic, echocardiographic, and laboratory findings. Noninvasive imaging studies and laboratory tests are initially obtained to confirm the diagnosis, ascertain the severity of HF, and determine the underlying cause if unclear from the history. The initial evaluation generally includes chest radiography, electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiography, and laboratory tests (including brain natriuretic peptide [BNP] or N-terminal pro-BNP [NT-proBNP], troponin, complete blood count, and serum chemistries). (See <a href=\"#H258994897\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation should only proceed if the patient is clinically stable. In patients who have severe cardiorespiratory compromise (ie, shock or impending cardiac arrest), prompt initiation of treatment to restore adequate perfusion should be provided prior to undergoing a detailed evaluation to determine the underlying cause of HF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77079\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef77079 \">algorithm 1</a>).
