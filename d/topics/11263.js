Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a biologically and clinically distinct variant of AML. In the World Health Organization classification system, APL is classified as acute promyelocytic leukemia with <em>PML-RARA</em>; it was previously classified as AML-M3 in the older French-American-British (FAB) classification system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of acute myeloid leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The cytogenetic hallmark of APL is a translocation involving <em>RARA</em>, the retinoic acid receptor alpha locus on chromosome 17 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The vast majority of cases of APL contain t(15;17)(q24.1;q21.1). However, several variant translocations involving <em>RARA</em> have been identified, including t(11;17) and t(5;17) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>], and distinguishing between these translocations is important because patients with the variant translocation t(11;17) are almost invariably resistant to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=all-trans-retinoic-acid-systemic-tretinoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">all-trans retinoic acid</a> (ATRA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia/abstract/4,5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,7</a>].

The molecular biology of acute myeloid leukemias other than APL and of ALL is discussed separately.

RARs belong to the nuclear <span class=\"nowrap\">steroid/thyroid</span> hormone receptor superfamily. Of the three RAR isoforms, RAR alpha is expressed primarily in hematopoietic cells.</p><p>RAR alpha is a member of a family of retinoid-binding transcription factors (including RXR) that regulate gene expression. RAR alpha contains discrete functional domains, including an amino terminal transcriptional activation domain, and DNA-binding, dimerization, and retinoid-binding domains. RAR alpha heterodimerizes with retinoid X receptor (RXR), and binds to RA-responsive elements to regulate transcription of target genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>In the absence of RA, heterodimers of RAR <span class=\"nowrap\">alpha/RXR</span> alpha interact with the nuclear corepressor, N-CoR, a ubiquitous nuclear protein that mediates transcriptional repression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia/abstract/4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8</a>]. RA dissociates N-CoR from the RAR <span class=\"nowrap\">alpha/RXR</span> alpha heterodimer, relieving transcriptional repression and presumably activating genes that lead to terminal differentiation of promyelocytes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F76618%7EHEME%2F66640\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76618 graphicRef66640 \">picture 1A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>The capacity of retinoids to induce myeloid differentiation was recognized prior to the identification of the involvement of RAR alpha in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). RA had been shown to enhance the growth of normal myeloid progenitors, to induce differentiation of the HL-60 promyelocytic cell line, and to induce terminal differentiation of primary human APL cells cultured in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Subsequently, the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=all-trans-retinoic-acid-systemic-tretinoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">all-trans retinoic acid</a> (ATRA) was found to induce complete remissions in patients with APL. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Rather than inducing cell death from cytotoxicity, ATRA induces differentiation of the malignant promyelocytic clone, an effect which can be observed in vitro and in vivo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. The effect in RA-sensitive NB4 cells in vivo is complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], with ATRA modulating expression of 169 genes in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Although complete remission can be obtained with ATRA alone, most patients with APL will ultimately relapse without additional cytotoxic chemotherapy. The basis for development of ATRA resistance remains unclear, but this phenomenon suggests that additional genetic events might occur in APL cells that confer resistance. The use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arsenic-trioxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">arsenic trioxide</a> has also been shown to induce remissions in APL, possibly by inducing the degradation of <span class=\"nowrap\">PML/RAR</span> alpha [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

An additional 5 percent of patients do not have the classic t(15;17), but have the <em><span class=\"nowrap\">PML/RARA</em></span> fusion gene, due to insertions or other complex chromosomal rearrangements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">The PML gene</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <em>PML</em> gene was first identified through its involvement with <em>RARA</em> in t(15;17) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. <em>PML</em> is expressed ubiquitously, and multiple alternative splice variants have been isolated. The normal function of the PML protein is not known, but overexpression of PML inhibits growth in cell lines, perhaps through the interferon gamma signaling pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>The product of the <em>PML</em> gene is a nuclear protein that contains motifs suggestive of a role in control of RNA transcription, including two putative amino terminal DNA-binding domains and a potential dimerization domain. PML is normally expressed in myeloid progenitors, and has been shown to localize to a discrete subnuclear compartment of unknown function, referred to as the nuclear body [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The nuclear body is a novel nuclear structure referred to by several names, including PODs (PML oncogenic domains) or ND10 (nuclear domain 10) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. </p><p>In APL cells, the integrity of the nuclear body is disrupted, and a microspeckled distribution of <span class=\"nowrap\">PML/RAR</span> alpha is observed. Treatment of APL cells with ATRA causes the nuclear bodies to be regenerated with proper relocalization of PML. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arsenic-trioxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Arsenic trioxide</a> (ATO) has also been found to target PML and <span class=\"nowrap\">PML/RAR</span> alpha to nuclear bodies and to induce their degradation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Thus, restoration of nuclear body structures by either ATRA or ATO correlates with the ability of these agents to induce remission of APL.</p><p>The following functional properties of the PML protein have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Localization of PML-associated proteins under physiological conditions</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Growth- and tumor-suppressor functions that are essential for certain apoptotic signals</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transcriptional co-activation with the tumor suppressor p53 (encoded by the <em>TP53 </em>gene)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">The fusion genes of t(15;17)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two novel fusion genes are formed as a result of the t(15;17): a <em><span class=\"nowrap\">PML/RARA</em></span> gene on the der(15) chromosome and an <em><span class=\"nowrap\">RARA/PML</em></span> gene on the der(17) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Whereas the <em><span class=\"nowrap\">PML/RARA</em></span> fusion gene is found consistently in all cases of t(15;17), the reciprocal <em><span class=\"nowrap\">RARA/PML</em></span> fusion can be detected in only 80 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] due, in some cases, to loss of the der(17) chromosome. Although this suggests that the <span class=\"nowrap\">RARA/PML</span> fusion protein may not be essential in the pathogenesis of APL, its expression has been postulated to represent a potential second genetic event contributing to the leukemic phenotype.</p><p>The resulting fusion gene on der(15) encodes a fusion protein in which the DNA-binding and dimerization domains of PML are fused to the DNA-binding and C-terminal portions of RAR alpha, including the retinoid binding site. Breakpoints in <em>RARA</em> typically occur within intron 2, whereas breakpoints in <em>PML</em> are more heterogeneous, occurring within intron 3, intron 6, or exon 6, producing what has been called short, long, and variable forms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. The three different isoforms have somewhat different clinical characteristics; lack of sufficient numbers of patients with the less common variable form has made it difficult to determine whether the three isoforms have similar clinical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Mechanism of action of PML/RARA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <span class=\"nowrap\">PML/RAR</span> alpha protein functions as an aberrant retinoid receptor that possesses altered DNA binding and transcriptional regulatory properties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. <span class=\"nowrap\">PML/RAR</span> alpha can heterodimerize with RXR and bind to retinoic acid (RA)-responsive elements in target genes.

Expression of a <em><span class=\"nowrap\">PML/RARA</em></span> variant that is unable to activate transcription in response to RA also leads to leukemia, but the leukemia does not differentiate in response to RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p>The timing of <em><span class=\"nowrap\">PML/RARA</em></span> expression during myeloid differentiation is a critical determinant in the development of leukemia. Comparison of the phenotypes in the transgenic mice that drive expression of <em><span class=\"nowrap\">PML/RARA</em></span> under the control of various myeloid-specific promoters at specific stages of myeloid differentiation include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In mice with the <em><span class=\"nowrap\">PML/RARA</em></span> transgene expressed under the control of the human <em>MRP8</em> (myeloid related protein 8) promoter, which drives expression in early myeloid progenitors and in mature neutrophils and monocytes, neutrophil numbers were normal, but differentiation was impaired. Approximately 30 percent developed acute leukemia with a latency of three to nine months; remission of the leukemia could be induced by ATRA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two groups generated transgenic mice expressing <em><span class=\"nowrap\">PML/RARA</em></span> under the control of the <em>CTSG</em> (human cathepsin G) promoter, which drives expression in promonocytes and promyelocytes.

This study showed that <span class=\"nowrap\">PML/RAR</span> alpha can increase hematopoietic self-renewal without causing a myeloproliferative neoplasm in mice.</p><p/><p>The relatively low frequency and long latency period for development of leukemia imply that genetic events in addition to the expression of <em>PML-RARA</em> are necessary in order for APL to occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. </p><p>The precise way in which the fusion protein functions as an oncoprotein is incompletely understood. The two products of the t(15;17) translocation (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">PML/RAR</span> alpha and RAR <span class=\"nowrap\">alpha/PML)</span> exhibit only subtle differences in function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. <span class=\"nowrap\">PML/RAR</span> alpha shows reduced sensitivity to retinoic acid (RA) in terms of dissociation of N-CoR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This could lead to persistent transcriptional repression, thereby preventing differentiation of promyelocytes. Pharmacologic concentrations of RA, as used in the treatment of APL, result in dissociation of N-CoR, presumably permitting differentiation of the leukemic cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The binding of the protein product of <span class=\"nowrap\">PML/RAR</span> alpha is thought to repress gene transcription through epigenomic changes including histone deacetylation or methylation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. One theory holds that <span class=\"nowrap\">PML/RAR</span> alpha creates homodimers that interact with histone methyltransferases, DNA methyltransferases, and histone deacetylases that act as corepressors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Together, they bind and repress expression of differentiation genes thereby blocking differentiation at the promyelocyte stage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F64089\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64089 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>A mechanism that includes the recruitment of a histone deacetylase may have therapeutic implications because in vitro studies have shown that resistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=all-trans-retinoic-acid-systemic-tretinoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">all-trans retinoic acid</a> can be overcome by the addition of a histone deacetylase inhibitor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].

The <span class=\"nowrap\">PLZF/RAR</span> alpha fusion protein antagonizes the normal function of RAR <span class=\"nowrap\">alpha/RXR</span> alpha heterodimers, suggesting that it behaves as a dominant negative mutant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>Although the number of cases studied is small, APL with t(11;17)(q23;q21.1) is usually <strong>refractory to therapy with retinoids</strong>, in contrast to the great majority of APL cases with the more common t(15;17) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia/abstract/4,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,57</a>].

The impact of <em>FLT3</em>-ITD mutations in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is more controversial.</p><p>In one study, <em>FLT3</em>-ITD mutations were identified in 35 of 171 patients (20 percent) with APL treated with all-trans retinoid acid (ATRA) plus anthracycline-based chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].
