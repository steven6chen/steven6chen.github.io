Several different disorders cause osteomalacia via mechanisms that result in hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, or direct inhibition of the mineralization process. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiology-of-osteomalacia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiology of osteomalacia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic review will present an overview of the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of adults with osteomalacia. The treatment of nutritional, hereditary vitamin D resistant, and pseudovitamin D-deficient rickets in children is discussed separately.

It can also produce characteristic symptoms, independently of the underlying cause, including diffuse bone and joint pain, muscle weakness, and difficulty walking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-osteomalacia/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. In a report of 17 patients with osteomalacia on bone biopsy, the following findings were observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-osteomalacia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone pain and muscle weakness in 16 (94 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone tenderness in 15 (88 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fracture in 13 (76 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Difficulty walking and waddling gait in four (24 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle spasms, cramps, a positive Chvostek's sign, <span class=\"nowrap\">tingling/numbness,</span> and inability to ambulate in one to two (6 to 12 percent)</p><p/><p>These symptoms may be insidious in onset. Bone pain is usually most pronounced in the lower spine, pelvis, and lower extremities, where fractures have taken place, and may be associated with tenderness to palpation. The pain is characterized as dull and aching and is aggravated by activity and weight bearing. Fractures may occur with little or no trauma, typically involving the ribs, vertebrae, and long bones. Abnormal spinal curvature or deformity of the thorax or pelvis appears only in severe osteomalacia of long duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-osteomalacia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The muscle weakness characteristically is proximal and may be associated with muscle wasting, hypotonia, and discomfort with movement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-osteomalacia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

The majority of patients have nutritional osteomalacia and will have a very low serum 25-hydroxyvitramin D (25[OH]D) (&lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [25 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L]),</span> low to low-normal serum calcium and phosphate, and high parathyroid hormone (PTH) and alkaline phosphatase (both total and bone-specific) levels.</p><p>Clinical evaluation, including history of gastrointestinal diseases or procedures, sun exposure, dietary habits, and onset (insidious or acute) and duration of symptoms, may help determine the etiology of osteomalacia. Laboratory abnormalities in osteomalacia are largely dependent on its cause (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F65400\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65400 \">table 1</a>), and therefore, laboratory findings are used to diagnose and determine the etiology of osteomalacia.

Multiple preparations of vitamin D and its metabolites are available. Vitamin D, rather than its metabolites, is used when possible since the cost is modest. Vitamin D metabolites are required when there is abnormal vitamin D metabolism (significant liver or renal disease). The recommended preparation and dose vary with the clinical condition, as described below.</p><p>With each regimen, the serum calcium concentration and urinary calcium excretion are monitored, initially after one month and three months, and then less frequently (every 6 to 12 months), until 24-hour urinary calcium excretion is normal. The serum calcium concentration is monitored to permit early detection of hypercalcemia from excessive dosing. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) should be measured approximately three to four months after initiating therapy. The dose should be adjusted to prevent hypercalciuria or hypercalcemia. In most cases, serum calcium and phosphate are normal after a few weeks of treatment, but alkaline phosphatase remains elevated for several months. Healing of osteomalacia is considered to have occurred when there are increases in urinary calcium excretion and BMD. Healing of the osteomalacia may take many months to a year or more and varies with the degree and duration of the deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-osteomalacia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>In addition to vitamin D supplementation, all patients should maintain a calcium intake of at least 1000 mg per day since inadequate intake of calcium may contribute to the development of osteomalacia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-osteomalacia/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].

Laboratory findings depend upon the underlying cause of osteomalacia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F65400\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65400 \">table 1</a>). Typical laboratory features of nutritional osteomalacia include elevations in alkaline phosphatase and parathyroid hormone (PTH) and decreases in calcium, phosphate, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations.

In addition, inadequate mineralization of osteoid and loss of secondary trabeculae lead to a loss of radiologic distinctness of the vertebral body trabeculae and concavity of the vertebral bodies (codfish vertebrae). Bone mineral density (BMD) is not required for the diagnosis of osteomalacia, and reduced BMD does not distinguish osteoporosis from osteomalacia. However, several studies have demonstrated markedly reduced spine, hip, and forearm BMD (as measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry [DXA]) in patients with osteomalacia related to vitamin D deficiency.

Laboratory evaluation should include measurement of serum concentrations of calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, 25(OH)D, PTH, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine. Radiographs may be helpful in certain settings (severe bone pain), to distinguish osteomalacia from multiple myeloma or Paget disease of bone. Bone biopsy and histomorphometry should be performed only when the diagnosis of osteomalacia is in doubt or the cause of osteomalacia is not determined with noninvasive testing, eg, to assess for one of the rare disorders of defective bone matrix.
