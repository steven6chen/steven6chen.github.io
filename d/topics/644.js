In an attempt to improve outcomes, it was postulated that a higher dialysis dose than commonly provided during conventional dialysis may increase survival among patients undergoing renal replacement therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-renal-replacement-therapies-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>However, this hypothesis was refuted in two large, well-designed studies in both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Hemodialysis (HEMO) Study found no improvement in patient survival when per-session hemodialysis dose was increased above the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-renal-replacement-therapies-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Each of these approaches is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Technical aspects of nocturnal hemodialysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=short-daily-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Short daily hemodialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, new and innovative forms of chronic renal replacement therapy have emerged. These include hemodiafiltration, sorbent hemodialysis, and the use of bioartificial membranes. These alternative approaches to the treatment of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) will be discussed in this topic review.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF UREMIC TOXINS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To better understand the possible role for alternative renal replacement therapies, it is worthwhile to briefly review the physical properties of known uremic toxins and how effectively conventional hemodialysis removes these substances. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uremic-toxins\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uremic toxins&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Uremic toxins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The uremic syndrome results largely from the accumulation of toxins, which include molecules that are normally filtered, excreted, or catabolized by the normal kidney. Of the large number of solutes retained in renal failure, at least 90 of the identified compounds may be toxic.</p><p>Solutes can be divided according to molecular weight as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-renal-replacement-therapies-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low-molecular-weight (MW) toxins (MW &lt;500 D)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Middle-MW toxins (500 to 15,000 D), referred to collectively as &quot;middle molecules&quot; (MMs)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large solutes (&gt;15,000 D), frequently classified as large-molecular-weight proteins (LMWPs)</p><p/><p>Low-MW molecules, exemplified by urea, contribute to the uremic syndrome since uremic symptoms are improved with conventional hemodialysis using low-flux membranes that principally remove such toxins. In addition, the clearance of urea (as measured by <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> urea) correlates with patient outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-renal-replacement-therapies-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The question of the relative contributions of retained MMs to uremic symptoms has been debated. However, there is little doubt that several of these compounds are toxic (beta-2 microglobulin, parathyroid hormone [PTH], and others). Beta-2 microglobulin levels, for example, are associated with the development of dialysis-related amyloidosis (DRA) and, possibly, reduced survival. It seems likely that beta-2 microglobulin is a marker for overall MM clearance, including more toxic and as yet unidentified solutes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dialysis-related-amyloidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dialysis-related amyloidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Lastly, evidence is accumulating that larger or protein-bound toxins contribute to the high prevalence of cardiovascular disease in ESRD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-renal-replacement-therapies-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].

As the MW of a solute (including those that are protein bound) increases, removal by diffusion becomes less efficient.</p><p>Removal of middle- and large-MW solutes depends upon their plasma concentration, MW, protein binding, length of dialysis, membrane permeability, and the presence of convective transport. Convective dialysis regimens have therefore been developed to exploit the ability of convection to remove larger MW solutes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CONVECTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rate of convective solute transport during dialysis depends upon the sieving coefficient of the solute for a given membrane and the ultrafiltration rate, which in turn depends on the transmembrane pressure (TMP). The sieving coefficient is the ratio of the concentration of the solute in the ultrafiltrate over the plasma. It ranges from 0 (no removal) to 1 (complete removal). As an example, the sieving coefficient for small molecules is 1, while the coefficient for beta-2 microglobulin is 0.6 across high-flux membranes and approaches 1 with some of the newer membranes.</p><p>Convective transport is also influenced by secondary membrane formation and concentration polarization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-renal-replacement-therapies-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondary membrane formation is related to the adsorption of proteins on the surface of the membrane and offers resistance to the transfer of both water and solutes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concentration polarization constitutes a layer of increased concentration of a high-molecular-weight (MW) solute close to the membrane, which is created as the specific solute is left behind during ultrafiltration due to its slower transfer rate. As this creates a concentration gradient and flux away from the membrane and towards the center of the hollow fiber, it impedes the convection of other solutes. At the same time, however, it increases the concentration gradient of that particular solute across the membrane, thereby facilitating its removal. Concentration polarization is more prominent with high ultrafiltration rates, low blood flow rates (less washout of the increased concentration layer), and the use of postdilution (rather than predilution) techniques (see below).</p><p/><p>High TMP is necessary for convection to take place. The relationship between TMP and ultrafiltration is linear at moderate TMP levels. However, ultrafiltration plateaus or reverses at higher TMP, thereby decreasing convective clearance while increasing the risk to the patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemofiltration and hemodiafiltration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intermittent hemofiltration and intermittent hemodiafiltration are two principal chronic renal replacement modalities that provide substantial removal of larger MW uremic toxins via convection. Daily convective therapy has also been used. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Daily hemofiltration/hemodiafiltration'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemofiltration &ndash; With hemofiltration, fluid is removed by the dialysis machine through increased TMP, and the replacement solution is infused intravenously at equal volume, minus the desired fluid volume removal. The clearance for a particular solute is dictated by the ultrafiltration volume and the sieving coefficient. As the sieving coefficient for low-MW unbound solutes equals 1, the clearance for small molecules is equal to the ultrafiltrate volume. Although hemofiltration is relatively effective in the removal of the larger MW solutes, it is relatively less effective (compared with diffusive clearance) in the removal of small molecules as it is restricted by the ultrafiltration volume.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodiafiltration &ndash; In general terms, hemodiafiltration is a combination of hemodialysis and hemofiltration and therefore leverages the enhanced middle molecule (MM) clearance of hemofiltration, while also providing better clearance of small solutes by adding a diffusive component. The EUropean DIALysis (EUDIAL) group proposed a more formal definition for hemodiafiltration that further highlights the central role of replacement fluid.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Hemodiafiltration is a blood purification therapy that combines diffusive and convective solute transport using a high-flux membrane characterized by an ultrafiltration coefficient greater than 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> per <span class=\"nowrap\">mmHg/m<sup>2</sup></span> and a sieving coefficient (S) for beta2-microglobulin of greater than 0.6. Convective transport is achieved by an effective convection volume of at least 20 percent of the total blood volume processed. Appropriate fluid balance is maintained by external infusion of a sterile, nonpyrogenic solution into the patient's blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-renal-replacement-therapies-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=technical-aspects-of-hemodiafiltration\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Technical aspects of hemodiafiltration&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Chronic hemofiltration and hemodiafiltration schedules are similar to conventional dialysis regimens, with three sessions per week of three to five hours' duration. A typical conservative (or high-dose) regimen for hemodiafiltration includes a postdilution configuration with a blood flow of 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> (500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> for high dose), a dialysate flow of 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min,</span> a substitution fluid infusion rate of 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> (120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> for high dose), and a high-flux dialyzer of 1.4 m<sup>2</sup> (2.2 m<sup>2</sup> for high dose) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-renal-replacement-therapies-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Continuous renal replacement therapies utilizing convection are also used in the intensive care setting for the treatment of acute kidney injury (AKI). These modalities are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=continuous-renal-replacement-therapy-in-acute-kidney-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Continuous renal replacement therapy in acute kidney injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Substitution fluid infusion methods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Replacement fluid can be infused before (predilution mode) or after the dialyzer (postdilution mode) in both hemofiltration and hemodiafiltration. More recently, a combination of the two configurations, mid-dilution, has been used with some success. A large ultrafiltrate volume is generated across a membrane with high hydraulic permeability.</p><p>There are important trade-offs with the pre- and postdilution substitution fluid infusion modes. These are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=technical-aspects-of-hemodiafiltration#H794154877\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Technical aspects of hemodiafiltration&quot;, section on 'Infusion of replacement fluid'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Other configurations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of alternate configurations have been described:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemofiltration with back-filtration consists of two filters in series: one for fluid removal and one for fluid reinjection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-renal-replacement-therapies-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the &quot;push-pull&quot; hemodiafiltration technique, the same filter is used for ultrafiltration and back-filtration sequentially [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-renal-replacement-therapies-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. The rate of ultrafiltration has to be much higher to compensate for the time lost during back-filtration.</p><p/><p>For reasons explained in the next section, &quot;on-line&quot; substitution fluid production is standard practice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Substitution fluid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initially, sterile Ringer's lactate solution was used as a substitution fluid for hemodiafiltration. More recently, bicarbonate-based solutions have been adopted. With these solutions, acetate, which is sometimes used in acid concentrates, is converted in vivo into bicarbonate.</p><p>Isotonic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> has also been used in <span class=\"nowrap\">hemofiltration/hemodiafiltration</span> (so-called acetate-free biofiltration [AFB]), with reports of improved hemodynamic stability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-renal-replacement-therapies-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>].</p><p>With the evolution of <span class=\"nowrap\">hemofiltration/hemodiafiltration,</span> there has been a tendency to prescribe larger substitution fluid volumes. This initially led to concerns of higher costs and greater risk of microbiologic contamination. Exposure to large fluid volume was of particular concern with back-filtration and push-pull hemofiltration techniques, in which dialysate crosses the membrane, thus increasing the risk of exposing patients to pyrogenic substances.</p><p>These concerns created the impetus to generate &quot;ultrapure&quot; dialysate, largely through the use of additional ultrafilters. These have been incorporated into standard hemodialysis equipment to facilitate &quot;on-line&quot; substitution fluid generation and are therefore available for use with conventional hemodialysis as well. These refinements are predicated on the growing concern that exposure to bacterial components not only can cause pyrogenic reactions, but also low-grade inflammation that may contribute to the atherosclerosis, malnutrition, and poor outcomes for dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-renal-replacement-therapies-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>The meaning of the term &quot;ultrapure&quot; has evolved over the last two decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-renal-replacement-therapies-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The microbiologic standards adopted by the American Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) for water for dialysis are &lt;200 colony-forming units (CFUs) and &lt;0.5 endotoxin units <span class=\"nowrap\">(EU)/mL</span>. The more stringent standards of the European Pharmacopoeia include &lt;100 CFU and &lt;0.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">EU/mL,</span> respectively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrapure-dialysis-fluid\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrapure dialysis fluid&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Subsequently adopted definitions require &lt;0.1 CFU and &lt;0.03 <span class=\"nowrap\">EU/mL</span> for a solution to be considered &quot;ultrapure.&quot; As compared with standard dialysis fluid, this translates into a threefold logarithmic difference in bacterial content and a onefold logarithmic difference in endotoxin content [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-renal-replacement-therapies-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Some investigators suggest an even lower number for CFU and endotoxin levels for the substitution fluid to be used for <span class=\"nowrap\">hemofiltration/hemodiafiltration</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-renal-replacement-therapies-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>The technique of &quot;on-line&quot; fluid production (initially termed cold sterilization) has allowed the production of an unlimited volume of &quot;pure&quot; substitution fluid at a cost close to that of dialysate for conventional hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-renal-replacement-therapies-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. The first step of the process includes the filtration of the water after it is produced using the reverse osmosis technique. The water is then used for the production of dialysate. This step has also been adopted in several hemodialysis machines to produce dialysate of improved purity for hemodialysis. The second step includes further filtration of the dialysate. Finally, a third filtration by a disposable microfilter completes the creation of the substitution solution. The disposable microfilter is replaced at the end of dialysis. The dialysate prior to the last filtration is used for the diffusive element of hemodiafiltration. The purity achieved using this approach has been repeatedly confirmed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-renal-replacement-therapies-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p>In most dialysis systems, the substitution solution volume is subtracted from the produced total dialysate volume. Increasing ultrafiltration and the need for substitution solution volume therefore improves convective efficacy but decreases the diffusive efficacy of the system. A balance between the two is needed.</p><p>In 2007, the European Best Practice Guidelines (EBPG) for hemodialysis recommended that exchange volumes should be as high as possible, with safety issues a significant consideration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-renal-replacement-therapies-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. More recent evidence suggests that the substitution volume should be higher than 18 to 20 L per session [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-renal-replacement-therapies-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/11,27-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,27-31</a>].</p><p>Major factors that place an upper limit on exchange volumes include blood flow rate and treatment time, while albumin and hematocrit play a minor role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-renal-replacement-therapies-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/29,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,32</a>]. The use of a dialysis catheter can limit blood flow, and high exchange volumes can therefore be achieved by increasing the dialysis time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Membranes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Membrane properties have evolved over time. Membranes with larger pores were developed to enhance large-molecule clearance but resulted in albumin loss. Although loss of albumin can increase the removal of albumin-bound solutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-renal-replacement-therapies-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], it is undesirable during convective therapy.</p><p>Newer technologies have led to the creation of asymmetrical membranes, which allow the removal of larger molecules (not including albumin) and molecules like phosphorus and beta-2 microglobulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-renal-replacement-therapies-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In addition, the need for a narrow fiber lumen to facilitate back-filtration (and therefore add a convective element to hemodialysis) was eliminated by the development and availability of low-cost sterile substitution solutions at volumes that make back-filtration unnecessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-renal-replacement-therapies-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The sieving coefficient of larger molecules has increased with newer membranes, approaching that of the glomerular membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-renal-replacement-therapies-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">BIOCHEMICAL EFFECTS OF CONVECTIVE THERAPIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Historically, there have been three purported benefits of convective therapies over conventional hemodialysis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The increased removal of larger molecules</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of high-flux biocompatible membranes (which decreases cytokine release) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-renal-replacement-therapies-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of ultrapure dialysate (which decreases cytokine release and introduces fewer impurities) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-renal-replacement-therapies-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]</p><p/><p>However, high-flux membranes and ultrapure dialysate are now widely available at a minimal cost and are used for conventional hemodialysis. In addition, with conventional hemodialysis, there is an element of convection through &quot;back-filtration&quot; when high-flux membranes with narrow fibers are used, although the degree of convective clearance is typically less with conventional hemodialysis.</p><p>Thus, the differences between the diffusive and convective technologies have become somewhat blurred. This becomes an issue when designing studies to compare these modalities.

Results were as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When <span class=\"nowrap\">stdKt/V</span> was used as a dialysis dose measure for small molecules, daily hemofiltration was equivalent to conventional hemodialysis and CAPD but inferior to short daily hemodialysis and nocturnal hemodialysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When <span class=\"nowrap\">stdKt/V</span> as a dialysis dose measure was used for the larger molecules, hemofiltration was better than all the regimens except for nocturnal hemodialysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When EKR was used, daily hemofiltration was inferior to conventional or daily hemodialysis for small molecules but still better for larger molecules.</p><p/><p>In a second study, seven times per week hemofiltration (at two hours per session) was required to achieve a predialysis urea similar to that achieved with hemodialysis performed thrice weekly for four hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-renal-replacement-therapies-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>]. This is consistent with the lower small-molecule clearance offered by hemofiltration when compared with hemodialysis. However, a six times a week, two-hour session would provide lower pretreatment beta-2 microglobulin levels than three times a week hemodialysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several small studies using daily <span class=\"nowrap\">hemofiltration/hemodiafiltration</span> have been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-renal-replacement-therapies-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/49,119-123\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,119-123</a>]. Some of the measured outcomes included beta-2 microglobulin levels, blood pressure control, quality of life (QOL), phosphate control, and growth in children. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One short-term study reported a 40 percent decrease in beta-2 microglobulin with daily hemofiltration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-renal-replacement-therapies-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study in which 12 patients switched from hemodialysis to hemofiltration at home on a daily basis for one month, hemofiltration was associated with a lower blood pressure, higher caloric intake, and improved QOL, findings consistent with previous reports on short daily hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-renal-replacement-therapies-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/121,123\" class=\"abstract_t\">121,123</a>]. A trend toward a decrease in serum beta-2 microglobulin could be safely ascribed to the hemofiltration alone. The infusion volume used was 40 percent of total body water, which offered a standard <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> of approximately 2.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study of eight patients undergoing in-center daily hemodiafiltration for six months, there were lower serum levels of predialysis blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (which were expected by the change to a daily schedule), as well as lower levels of other solutes, including beta-2 microglobulin and homocysteine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-renal-replacement-therapies-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>]. Additional benefits included improved phosphate control, discontinuation of all antihypertensive agents, and a 30 percent regression in left ventricular mass. Although some of these results can be attributed to the daily treatment schedule, the decrease in the pretreatment levels of beta-2 microglobulin and the improvement in phosphate control are clearly attributable to both convection and the increased treatment frequency.</p><p/><p>Daily hemodiafiltration has been used successfully in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-renal-replacement-therapies-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/124\" class=\"abstract_t\">124</a>].

Since clearance of water, urea, and inorganic ions was limited, it could only be used as an adjunct to dialysis.</p><p>Dialysate regeneration and more elaborate sorbent systems had evolved by the 1970s in the form of the REcirculating DialYsis (REDY) System [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-renal-replacement-therapies-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>]. Uremic solutes were metabolized or adsorbed by a sorbent cartridge. The main advantages of this method were that there was no need for water and it was portable. It has been used in the hospital setting, as well as at home and when traveling. It represented the best choice for the military, as well as in case of natural disasters, when access to large volumes of water for dialysate production can be limited.</p><p>The sorbent cartridge included five layers:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An activated carbon layer, which adsorbed nitrogenous waste products</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A glucose hydrous zirconium layer, which is an anion exchanger (acetate was exchanged for phosphate, fluoride, and heavy metals)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A zirconium phosphate layer, which was a cation exchanger (Na+ and H+ were exchanged for ammonium, Ca+2, Mg+2, and K+)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A urease layer (urease, bound to aluminum oxide, catalyzes the conversion of urea into ammonia and carbamic acid)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A purification layer (activated carbon removes particulate matter, heavy metals, and oxidizing substances)</p><p/><p>Although the REDY System was eventually abandoned because of aluminum leaching, newer sorbents, as well as a new and lightweight hemodialysis machine, offer a promising comeback [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-renal-replacement-therapies-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=home-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Home hemodialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Adsorption is a physicochemical process in which molecules are bound to sorbent particles or porous surfaces either through a chemical or physical process. It is heavily dependent on pore structure. The pore size is divided into macro (&gt;500 A), meso (20 to 500 A), and micro (&lt;20 A) sizes.</p><p>Removal of larger-molecular-weight (MW) substances has focused on sorbents containing mesopores. Activated charcoal contains only a small number of mesopores compared with synthetic resin adsorbents, which are the preferred materials.</p><p>Newer sorbents have also been used in the form of a cartridge connected in series with a dialyzer to adsorb larger-MW toxins such as beta-2 microglobulin, angiogenin, leptin, and cytokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-renal-replacement-therapies-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/127,128\" class=\"abstract_t\">127,128</a>]. The Lixelle device has been used in Japan to adsorb beta-2 microglobulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-renal-replacement-therapies-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/129\" class=\"abstract_t\">129</a>]. Reduced symptoms of dialysis-related amyloidosis (DRA) as well as a limited reduction in bone cysts on radiographs and short-lived reduction of inflammatory cytokines, endotoxin, and peptidoglycans have been reported. The cost of the treatment using Lixelle is high. In Japan, coverage of this treatment is granted for up to one year. This sorbent device was also found to adsorb cytokines, endotoxin fragments, and microbial fragments. Thus, it could be potentially of benefit to the septic patient in the intensive care unit (ICU). These uses are being explored [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-renal-replacement-therapies-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/130\" class=\"abstract_t\">130</a>].</p><p>Although oral sorbents were considered in the treatment of ESRD in the past [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-renal-replacement-therapies-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/131-133\" class=\"abstract_t\">131-133</a>], no efficient commercial application exists to date. There is still interest in this area in the form of biochemically active microcapsules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-renal-replacement-therapies-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>].</p><p>The future use of sorbents as an adjunct to the renal replacement therapy depends upon the clinical results from ongoing studies and on the added cost of this treatment. As yet, there does not appear to be a clearly defined role for this technology in routine clinical practice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H522757049\"><span class=\"h1\">EXPERIMENTAL TECHNOLOGIES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal tubule assist device</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Renal replacement therapy in its current forms does not replace the metabolic and endocrine functions of the renal tubular cells. In the setting of acute tubular necrosis, for example, proximal tubular function is lost. It is therefore desirable to provide not only the small solute clearance conferred by traditional dialytic modalities, but also some supportive cell function.</p><p>Within the last decade, human proximal renal tubular cells have been successfully cultured on hollow-fibre scaffolds, and a renal tubule cell assist device (RAD), used in series with a hemofiltration circuit, has been developed. The RAD can replace metabolic and endocrine functions, including improved acid-base balance (via glutamine metabolism) and activation of vitamin D, in acutely uremic dogs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-renal-replacement-therapies-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/134\" class=\"abstract_t\">134</a>].</p><p>The effectiveness and safety of RAD therapy was evaluated in an open-label, phase-II trial of 58 patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) who were randomly assigned (2:1 ratio) to receive RAD (up to 72 hours) plus continuous venovenous hemofiltration or continuous venovenous hemofiltration alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-renal-replacement-therapies-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/135\" class=\"abstract_t\">135</a>]. There was a nonsignificant trend toward improved survival at 28 days (primary endpoint) with RAD plus continuous venovenous hemofiltration (67 versus 39 percent for continuous venovenous hemofiltration alone). Limitations of the study include low frequency of completion of the planned 72 hours of RAD, as-treated primary analysis, reporting of multiple outcomes, and low statistical power [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-renal-replacement-therapies-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/136\" class=\"abstract_t\">136</a>].</p><p>Despite these limitations, this innovation may eventually represent a significant advance in the management of AKI. The main technological limitations for commercialization of devices providing a cell-based renal replacement therapies are the lack of consistent source of cells and of cost-effective manufacturing, storage, and distribution processes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-renal-replacement-therapies-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/137\" class=\"abstract_t\">137</a>].</p><p>Cell sourcing and <span class=\"nowrap\">storage/distribution</span> issues may be addressed through the development of the Bioartificial Renal Epithelial Cell System (BRECS).

These principally include hemodiafiltration, sorbent hemodialysis, and the use of bioartificial membranes. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Solute removal during conventional hemodialysis occurs by three different mechanisms: passive diffusion, adsorption of solutes to the dialysis membrane, and convection. Removal of middle- and large-molecular-weight (MW) toxins depends upon certain characteristics, including convection. Convective dialysis regimens have therefore been developed to exploit the ability of convection to remove larger MW solutes. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Toxin removal'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The two principal regimens used to provide convection are intermittent hemofiltration and intermittent hemodiafiltration. Substitution fluid can be infused before (predilution mode) or after the dialyzer (postdilution mode) in both hemofiltration and hemodiafiltration. A generally useful approach is to use predilution in hemofiltration and postdilution in hemodiafiltration, aiming for the maximum volume of fluid exchange in both cases. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Hemofiltration and hemodiafiltration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benefits with convective therapies compared with conventional hemodialysis are better removal of beta-2 microglobulin and improved hemodynamic stability and possibly better cardiovascular outcome and patient survival, especially if the replacement fluid volume exceeds 18 to 20 L per session. Convective therapies are rarely used for chronic renal replacement therapy in the United States. (See <a href=\"#H740770\" class=\"local\">'Patient survival'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with hemodynamic instability or dialysis-related amyloidosis (DRA), we suggest the use of convective therapies, if available, rather than conventional intermittent hemodialysis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Clinical effects of convective therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sorbent technologies rely on a physicochemical process where molecules are bound to sorbent particles or porous surfaces either through a chemical or physical process. Newer sorbents are used in the form of a cartridge connected in series with a dialyzer to adsorb larger-MW toxins. Sorbents are also used to regenerate spent dialysate. This sorbent application may play a future role in the development of a wearable artificial kidney. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Sorbents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Experimental technologies include a renal tubule assist device (RAD) used in series with a hemofiltration circuit. The use of cell-based renal replacement therapies technologies may be part of the development of an implantable artificial kidney.
