The upper and lower airways serve as a conduit for airflow to and from the gas exchange regions of the lungs. Nerves innervating the airway mucosa initiate homeostatic and defensive reflexes that preserve lung capacity for gas exchange. In airway diseases, such as allergic rhinitis, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), homeostatic and defensive reflexes are dysfunctional <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dysregulated. Much of the pathology and many of the symptoms associated with upper and lower airway disease are directly or indirectly related to these changes in neuronal function (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F54768\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54768 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Neural control of the upper and lower airways will be reviewed here; other aspects of the pathogenesis of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and COPD are presented separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anatomy and etiology of taste and smell disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The remaining afferent innervation of the nasal mucosa arises from the ophthalmic (through the ethmoidal nerve) and maxillary branches of the trigeminal nerve. The cell bodies of non-olfactory, primary sensory nerves from the nose are located in the trigeminal ganglion. These afferent nerve fibers branch extensively, innervating the epithelium, vessels, and glands of the nasal mucosa. The extensive branching and innervation of multiple effectors in the mucosa, along with synthesis and peripheral transport of neuropeptides with many potential actions in the nose, provides the anatomical substrate necessary for producing axonal reflexes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7079588\" class=\"local\">'Axon reflexes'</a> below.)</p><p>Reflexes (eg, sneezing, itching, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion) can be initiated within the nose by a variety of stimuli including mechanical probing, hypertonic saline, cold <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dry air, histamine, allergen, nicotine, bradykinin, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capsaicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capsaicin</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Evidence for nasal afferent nerve subtypes that are differentially responsive to inflammatory mediators and irritants has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. While both histamine and bradykinin, when applied selectively to the nasal mucosa, initiate reflex-mediated, atropine-sensitive mucus secretion, only histamine readily initiates sneezing in normal patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. The data are at least suggestive of the notion that nasal autonomic reflexes and sneezing are differentially regulated by nasal afferent nerve subtypes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Efferent innervation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves innervate the vasculature and glands of the nasal mucosa. Sympathetic branches of the upper four cervical nerves meet in the superior cervical ganglia; postganglionic sympathetic nerves travel to the nasal mucosa via branches of the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII). Parasympathetic branches of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) are relayed to the nasal mucosa via the sphenopalatine ganglion. Studies conducted in animals using selective stimulation of autonomic nerve pathways and pharmacological studies in human subjects indicate that sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves have opposing actions on their target tissues in the nasal mucosa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55490\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55490 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F52778\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52778 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>Parasympathetic nerves and their neurotransmitters mediate mucus secretion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vasodilatation. Conversely, sympathetic nerves and sympathetic neurotransmitters have little or no effect on mucus secretion, but constrict the blood vessels of the nasal mucosa and the capacitance vessels of the sinuses. The opposing actions of these systems likely determine levels of end organ function in the nose. Postganglionic nerves might also interact prejunctionally to modulate neurotransmitter release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Reflex regulation of upper airway function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The nose filters and conditions inspired air. Reflexes initiated by activation of upper airway afferent nerves preserve and facilitate this conditioning function of the nose. Nasal reflexes also play an important defensive role for the exposed nasal mucosa, hindering infection and clearing inhaled pathogens and irritants either by sneezing or with mucus secretion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-rhinitis#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of rhinitis&quot;, section on 'Normal nasal reflexes'</a>.)</p><p>Trigeminal afferent nerves terminate bilaterally and centrally in lateral regions of the pons, medulla and cervical spinal cord, either rostrally in the principal sensory nuclei of the trigeminal nerve, or caudally in the spinal trigeminal nuclei. The spinal trigeminal nuclei occupy extensive portions of the brainstem and cervical spinal cord and lie lateral but adjacent to many key structures in the brainstem relevant to the lower airways. The proximity of trigeminal afferent nerve terminations to brainstem structures involved in regulation of lower airway function and respiration may facilitate coordination of respiratory reflexes. This arrangement also provides the anatomical substrate for reflex effects on the lower airways initiated by upper airway irritation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">LOWER AIRWAYS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Extrinsic innervation</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Vagus nerves</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lower airways and lungs are innervated bilaterally by the vagus nerves. The majority of vagal fibers projecting to the airways and lungs are afferent (or sensory) in nature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Vagal afferent nerves have their cell bodies in one of two ganglia: The jugular (superior vagal) or nodose (inferior vagal) ganglia. The remaining vagal nerve fibers projecting to the airways are preganglionic parasympathetic nerve fibers innervating parasympathetic ganglia, and motor nerve fibers innervating the striated muscle of the larynx and upper airways (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72678\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72678 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p>While difficult to study in humans, the guinea pig nodose afferent neurons project to the nucleus of the solitary tract (nTS), and jugular neurons have their central terminations in the paratrigeminal nucleus (Pa5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Nodose neurons express more of the 160 KD neurofilament proteins and the alpha3 subunit of <span class=\"nowrap\">Na(+)/K(+)</span> ATPase. Significantly more jugular neurons express the neuropeptides substance P (SP) and, especially, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Indeed, terminal fibers in the Pa5 compared with the nTS are characterized by their significantly greater expression of CGRP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>The parasympathetic nerves and the laryngeal motor nerve fibers arise bilaterally from the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve (dmnX) and nucleus ambiguus (nA). Although these brainstem structures have a viscerotropic organization, considerable overlap among the sites of afferent nerve subtype termination and efferent projection is apparent. This overlap accounts in part for the clustering of autonomic reflexes (eg, effects on heart rate, respiratory pattern, airway caliber) initiated by selective activation of specific afferent nerve subtypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Spinal afferent and sympathetic nerves</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postganglionic sympathetic nerves projecting to the airways arise bilaterally, primarily from the superior cervical ganglia and the thoracic sympathetic ganglia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Spinal afferent innervation has also been described and may regulate airway sympathetic nerve function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The superior laryngeal nerves, recurrent laryngeal nerves, and the bronchial branches of the vagus nerves carry the vagal and spinal nerve fibers projecting to the airways. Both afferent and efferent vagal nerves project bilaterally, although ipsilateral innervation is far more extensive. There is no evidence for contralateral projections of postganglionic sympathetic nerves.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Intrinsic innervation</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Nerve plexuses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Afferent and efferent nerve fibers occupy multiple nerve plexuses in the airway wall from the larynx to the terminal bronchioles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55047\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55047 \">figure 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F67835\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67835 \">picture 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Afferent nerve fibers surround epithelial cells in an epithelial nerve plexus. Efferent innervation of the epithelium has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Both afferent and efferent nerves are found in the plexus of the submucosa where most effectors of the airways (airway smooth muscle, mucus glands, arterioles) are located. Airway parasympathetic ganglia are primarily found in the extrapulmonary airways. Parasympathetic ganglia containing as few as one neuron to over 100 neurons are randomly and sparsely dispersed in the adventitial nerve plexus and are associated primarily with the extrapulmonary airways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The adventitial nerve plexus merges with the submucosal plexus in the intrapulmonary airways.</p><p>With the exception of afferent nerve endings terminating in neuroepithelial bodies of the epithelium, airway afferent nerves form apparently nonspecialized (based on appearance) receptive fields in the epithelium and in and around various structures of the airway wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/20,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22</a>]. Swellings associated with airway afferent nerve terminals in the epithelium can contain synaptic vesicles with neurotransmitters that may be released during axonal reflexes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. These nerve terminals are thought to be the peripheral terminations of airway and lung C-fibers. Afferent nerve fibers may also innervate other effector tissues in the airway wall, including glands, airway smooth muscle, blood vessels, and airway parasympathetic ganglia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/21-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-29</a>].</p><p>Postganglionic autonomic nerves innervate airway glands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], vasculature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>], and smooth muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Little discernible specialization is apparent prejunctionally on the postganglionic autonomic nerves of the airways or postjunctionally on effector cells innervated by these nerves. Although little change in nerve fiber densities in the smooth muscle from the trachea to the bronchioles is apparent, the neurochemistry of the nerve fibers may differ considerably in the large and small airways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/28,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,30,31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Airway parasympathetic ganglia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Airway ganglion neurons play important integrative roles in regulating airway autonomic tone. Synaptic integration is facilitated by the complex morphology of the ganglion neurons and by many biophysical properties that facilitate integration of synaptic input [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Synaptic transmission between pre- and postganglionic parasympathetic nerves is mediated by acetylcholine acting on nicotinic receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/21,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,32</a>]. Nicotinic receptor activation initiates depolarizations known as fast excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F74594\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74594 \">figure 5</a>)). Most fEPSPs are below the threshold required for action potential formation. Summation of multiple fEPSPs appears to be necessary to reach threshold for action potential generation. The capacity of airway ganglion neurons to filter preganglionic input can be modulated, either through the effects of noncholinergic neurotransmitters acting within the ganglia or by autacoid-dependent alterations in the excitability of the ganglia neurons.</p><p>Airway ganglion neurons innervate adjacent neurons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Collaterals of afferent nerves containing neuropeptides are also found in airway ganglia and regulate synaptic transmission in the ganglia through peripheral reflexes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/25,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,29</a>]. Multiple neurotransmitters (eg, substance P, neurokinin A, nitric oxide, vasoactive intestinal peptide) in addition to acetylcholine have been localized to parasympathetic ganglion neurons innervating the lower airways (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80605\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80605 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55490\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55490 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/9,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Reflex regulation</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Afferent nerve subtypes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Airway afferent nerves can be subclassified based on their neurochemistry, responsiveness to physical and chemical stimuli, myelination, conduction velocity, origin, and sites of termination in the airways and CNS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/8,22,34-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,22,34-38</a>]. Of the three subtypes of airway mechanoreceptors that have been described, the first and second subtypes respond to the dynamic (rapidly adapting receptors; RARs) and sustained (slowly adapting receptors; SARs) physical effects of lung inflation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F51558\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51558 \">figure 6</a>). RARs can also be activated by bronchoconstrictors such as histamine, acetylcholine, and leukotrienes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The third subtype of airway mechanoreceptor can be localized to the larynx, trachea, and mainstem bronchi and is activated by punctate mechanical stimuli and acid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. These extrapulmonary vagal mechanoreceptors are differentiated from RARs and SARs by their insensitivity to changes in airway luminal pressures and airway smooth muscle contraction; they have been shown to play an essential role in the initiation of cough. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of subacute and chronic cough in adults&quot;, section on 'Etiologies'</a>.)</p><p>When activated, airway mechanoreceptors initiate alterations in autonomic nerve activity and cough, and play an essential role in controlling respiratory rate and tidal volume. RARs and SARs are sporadically active during the respiratory cycle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F51558\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51558 \">figure 6</a>). Their persistent activity may be of fundamental importance to the maintenance of baseline autonomic tone and respiratory pattern, and may influence evoked reflexes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/36,37,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37,40</a>].</p><p>Afferent nerves that are similar to somatic nociceptors also innervate the airways. Most airway nociceptors are unmyelinated C-fibers and are generally unresponsive to mechanical stimuli and are thus inactive during tidal breathing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/8,34,35,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,34,35,40</a>]. Airway nociceptors are, however, activated by inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>, prostaglandin D<sub>2</sub>, bradykinin and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), but may also be activated by airway acidification, changes in airway surface liquid osmolarity, and by the vanilloid receptor agonist <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capsaicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capsaicin</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F51558\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51558 \">figure 6</a>). Subtypes of bronchopulmonary C-fibers have been described and may play unique and possibly opposing roles in regulating airway and lung function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/8,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,41</a>]. Much of the investigation behind sensory reflexes has been carried out in animals and translational studies are yet to be undertaken in human tissue. However, a study utilizing immunohistochemistry in whole mount biopsies of human airway innervation has indicated that the morphology of human lungs is similar to that of guinea pigs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Bronchopulmonary C-fibers initiate autonomic nerve activity and cough and have unique effects on respiratory pattern, when activated through cell surface receptors such as the transient receptor potential (TRP) vanilloid and cation channels (eg, TRPV1, TRPA1, and <span class=\"nowrap\">TRPV4/P2X3)</span> or by other cell surface receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capsaicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Capsaicin</a> activates bronchopulmonary C-fibers (and certain populations of A-delta fibers) by activating the TRP vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) ion channel. Endogenous ligands for TRPV1 include protons, 12- and 15-lipoxygenase products, N-arachidonoyl-dopamine and the endogenous cannabinoid receptor agonist anandamide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/45-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-52</a>]. Airway C-fibers may also express the TRP cation channel, TRP ankyrin type 1 (TRPA1). Both TRPV1 and TRPA1 have been shown to be highly expressed in dorsal root, trigeminal, and vagal (jugular and nodose) ganglia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/53-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-55</a>]. TRPA1 can be activated by a variety of endogenous mediators (eg, prostaglandins A<sub>2</sub>, E<sub>2</sub>, and D<sub>2</sub>), extracts from spicy foods (cinnamon, garlic, mustard oil, wasabi), environmental irritants present in air pollution, vehicle exhaust and cigarette smoke (eg, acrolein, isothiocyanates), products of oxidation (4-oxynonenal, 4-hydroxynonenal, ozone), and temperatures below 17&ordm;C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-58</a>]. TRPA1 and TRPV1 channels are also reported to play a role in G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling in sensory afferents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>]. </p><p>The TRP cation channel, subfamily V, member 4 (TRPV4) is widely expressed in the respiratory tract, including epithelium (human), macrophages (human and murine), and airway smooth muscle (human and guinea-pig) and may also contribute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/60-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-63</a>]. TRPV4 can be activated by a diverse range of stimuli including acidic pH, temperature, mechanical stress, hypo-osmotic solutions, the synthetic phorbol ester 4alpha phorbol, 12, 13-didecanoate (4alpha-PDD), and arachidonic acid metabolites (epoxyeicosatrienoic acids) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Furthermore, a TRPV4 selective agonist has been shown to activate guinea-pig airway-specific nodose ganglion cells. TRPV4 agonists and hypo-osmolar solutions can evoke depolarization of human, guinea-pig, and murine vagus in vitro and action potential firing of A-delta (not C-fibers) in the guinea-pig in vivo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. However, these effects can be inhibited by a P2X3 receptor antagonist identifying the TRPV4-ATP-P2X3 axis as a key osmosensing pathway involved in sensory nerve reflex events and an indirect effect of TRPV4 on nerve activation. Consistent with this hypothesis are previous studies detailing P2X3 expression on airway sensory nerves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>]. Single cell PCR demonstrated sparse expression of TRPV4 in nodose neurons suggesting that ATP may be released from neuron associated cells (eg, glia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]) or on other non-neuronal cells (eg, smooth muscle, epithelium, macrophage) where TRPV4 expression has been demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/60-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-63</a>]. The absence of TRPV4-ATP mediated effects on C-fibers suggests a distinct neurobiology for this ion channel compared with TRPV1 and TRPA1.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Autonomic nerve subtypes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves innervate the lower airways. Sympathetic nerves primarily innervate the bronchial vasculature, while airway parasympathetic nerves innervate the vasculature as well as airway smooth muscle and glands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/24,26-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26-30</a>].</p><p>Airway autonomic control was once thought of as a balance between the opposing actions of cholinergic-parasympathetic nerves and adrenergic-sympathetic nerves. Diseases such as asthma, it was inferred, were due to an imbalance of the actions of these autonomic neurotransmitters in the airways. Despite the accuracy of some aspects of this model and its utility in producing two of the major classes of drugs used in respiratory disease (anticholinergics and beta-agonists), it has become apparent that autonomic control is far more complex than previously envisioned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/9,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,28</a>]. Multiple neurotransmitters have been localized to the autonomic nerves innervating the airways and their role as neurotransmitters <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neuromodulators in the airways has been confirmed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55490\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55490 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Autonomic reflexes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postganglionic parasympathetic nerves innervate airway smooth muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], mucus glands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], and vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>] throughout the airways. When activated, airway parasympathetic-cholinergic nerves initiate contractions of airway smooth muscle, mucus secretion, and vasodilatation.</p><p>Human airway smooth muscle expresses abundant beta adrenoceptors (primarily beta-2 adrenoceptors). While functional evidence of sympathetic (adrenergic) innervation of human airway smooth muscle is lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], evidence exists for sympathetic innervation of airway smooth muscle in other species. Catecholamines from the adrenal gland are likely the primary endogenous ligand for the beta adrenoceptors expressed on human airway smooth muscle. Sympathetic nerves also appear to play little or no role in regulating mucus secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, sympathetic nerves do innervate the airway vasculature, mediating vasoconstriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Both sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves likely regulate mucociliary clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p>Noncholinergic parasympathetic nerves are the only functional relaxant nerves innervating human airway smooth muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/28,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,30,31</a>]. The neurotransmitter mediating relaxation of human airway smooth muscle is the gaseous transmitter nitric oxide (NO), synthesized from arginine by the neuronal isoform of NO synthase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>]. These nonadrenergic, noncholinergic relaxant responses can be evoked in airways from the trachea and bronchi. In addition to NO, there may be a role for vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) in the non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic relaxant response in other species (eg, guinea-pig).</p><p>Noncholinergic-parasympathetic nerves also regulate mucus secretion and vasodilatation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/24,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26</a>]. Simultaneous activation of cholinergic and noncholinergic parasympathetic nerves may have synergistic effects on airway mucus secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. As an example, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and cholinergic stimulation synergistically increase mucous secretion.</p><p>Studies in animals provide conclusive evidence that noncholinergic parasympathetic relaxant neurotransmitters are not co-released with acetylcholine from postganglionic parasympathetic nerves innervating airway smooth muscle. Rather, a distinct parasympathetic pathway mediates noncholinergic relaxations of airway smooth muscle. Reflexes also differentially regulate cholinergic and noncholinergic parasympathetic responses. Circumstantial evidence indicates a similar arrangement of the parasympathetic innervation of human airways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/28,31,73-75\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,31,73-75</a>].</p><p>Many stimuli initiate reflex alterations in airway parasympathetic-cholinergic nerve activity. Bronchoconstrictors such as histamine, prostaglandin D2, leukotrienes, and acetylcholine, for example, initiate reflex bronchoconstriction, mucus secretion and vasodilatation. Nociceptor stimulants such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capsaicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capsaicin</a>, bradykinin, hypertonic saline, and acidic solutions initiate these reflexes and also cough. Other stimuli initiating reflex bronchospasm include chemoreceptor stimulation, esophageal afferent nerve stimulation, and upper airway afferent nerve stimulation. Chemoreceptor stimulation also evokes reflex dilatation of the bronchial vasculature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/24,26,28,40,75-80\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26,28,40,75-80</a>].</p><p>Stimuli initiating reflex bronchodilatation through activation of noncholinergic parasympathetic nerves include stimulants of airway mechanoreceptors and airway nociceptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/28,75,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,75,81</a>]. In contrast, chemoreceptor stimulation is without apparent effect on noncholinergic-parasympathetic nerve activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Activation of skeletal muscle afferent nerves as might happen during exercise also initiates reflex bronchodilatation, but primarily through <strong>withdrawal</strong> of baseline cholinergic tone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/28,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,82</a>].</p><p>It is not readily apparent what, if any, significance there is to the differential reflex regulation of airway cholinergic and noncholinergic parasympathetic nerves. Cholinergic reflexes are fast in onset and rapidly reversed.</p><p>The kinetics of cholinergic nerve-mediated responses renders these nerves ideally suited to regulate airway tone on a breath-to-breath basis. Cholinergic nerves can also be rapidly recruited during cough, thereby facilitating clearance of inhaled irritants, secretions, or pathogens by narrowing the airway passages and thus increasing airflow velocity. </p><p>Reflex regulation of airway sympathetic nerve activity is poorly described, and the role of adrenergic nerves and circulating catecholamines in regulating airways reactivity remains unclear. Beta adrenoceptor antagonists such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> have no effect on airways responsiveness in nonasthmatic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/28,83-85\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,83-85</a>]. Adrenoreceptors and thus the endogenous catecholamines may, however, play an important role in regulating airway caliber and airway responsiveness in asthma. It seems likely that in humans, the catecholamines secreted by the adrenal glands are more important in regulating airway function than the sparse sympathetic-adrenergic innervation of the airways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7079588\"><span class=\"h1\">AXON REFLEXES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sensory nerves innervating somatic tissues regulate local physiology and inflammation independent of the central nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/86-88\" class=\"abstract_t\">86-88</a>]. When activated, somatic nociceptive C-fibers release pro-inflammatory transmitters, such as substance P, to initiate neurogenic inflammation. This peripheral release of transmitters from sensory nerve collaterals and the resulting end organ effects are called the axon reflex. Afferent nerves innervating the airway mucosa of most species, including humans, express the anatomical attributes of the sensory nerves mediating axon reflexes in somatic tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/18,89,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,89,90</a>].</p><p>Airway afferent nerve endings may contain substance P, neurokinin A, and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). When administered exogenously, these putative neurotransmitters have profound effects in the airways, initiating bronchoconstriction, mucus secretion, vasodilation, plasma exudation, and inflammatory cell recruitment. These observations led to the intriguing hypothesis that axonal reflexes contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory airways disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/1,2,23,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,23,28</a>]. Furthermore, TRPV1 (following <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capsaicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capsaicin</a> and low pH stimulation) and TRPA1 activation (following cigarette smoke extract, crotonaldehyde, and acrolein) mobilizes calcium in cultured guinea pig jugular ganglia neurons and promotes contraction of isolated guinea pig bronchi thought to be due to the release of tachykinins such as substance P and neurokinin A and activation of neurokinin NK2 receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/59,91-93\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,91-93</a>].</p><p>Axon reflexes have been described in the lower airways of rodents; however, the role of axon reflexes in the lower airways of humans is less clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Morphological studies of the human airway mucosa reveal a dense plexus of afferent nerves innervating the epithelium, but a general sparseness of neurokinin-containing nerve fibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Axonal reflexes may, however, occur in the human nose. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capsaicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Capsaicin</a>, hypertonic saline, or bradykinin challenge evokes mucus secretion, plasma extravasation, substance P release, and inflammatory cell recruitment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/1,2,5-7,90,94-99\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,5-7,90,94-99</a>]. The neurotransmitters mediating these effects have not been identified. Tachykinins do, however, initiate comparable effects when applied selectively to the human nasal mucosa, and substance P-containing nerve fibers innervate the human nasal mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/1,2,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,90</a>]. Sensory innervation of the nasal mucosa is provided by an extensive network supplied by the trigeminal nerve.

Elevated parasympathetic-cholinergic tone has been documented in both asthma and COPD, and anticholinergic medications reduce airways obstruction in rhinitis, asthma, and COPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/28,100-104\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,100-104</a>].

Evidence in animals suggests that airway sensory nerves, central reflexes, and a parasympathetic effector arm leading to cholinergic constrictor responses play a key role in the late asthmatic response in two preclinical models in different species. This finding, if reproduced in patients with asthma, suggests that anti-cholinergic therapy may be effective in patients with a late phase response to allergen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/106,107\" class=\"abstract_t\">106,107</a>].

Vasoconstriction initiated by alpha adrenoceptor agonists (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pseudoephedrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pseudoephedrine</a>) reduces upper airways obstruction in patients with rhinitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>].</p><p>Pharmacological studies of nasal obstruction in human subjects indicate that sympathetic nerves tonically sustain upper airway patency through alpha1 adrenoceptor activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. Histamine or the histamine H3 receptor agonist R-a-methyl-histamine, when applied exogenously to the human nasal mucosa, creates nasal blockage in part through histamine H3 receptor-dependent prejunctional inhibition of sympathetic-adrenergic nerves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. Whether or not sympathetic nerve-mediated regulation of vascular tone is altered in airways disease is unclear. It is also unclear what role nasal parasympathetic nerves play in regulating upper airway patency in normal human subjects, although their role in regulating mucus secretion and upper airways obstruction in rhinitis is well established.</p><p>Several studies indicate that nitric oxide (NO)-dependent post-exercise hyperemia and plasma leakage in the lower airway mucosa may be a mechanism of cold air <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> exercise-induced asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/111,112\" class=\"abstract_t\">111,112</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction&quot;</a>).

Allergen challenge further increases airways reactivity through parasympathetic nerve recruitment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>The mechanisms for the heightened neuronal responsiveness associated with allergic inflammation have not been defined but are thought to involve the increased activation of TRP channels. Data have been published suggesting that TRP channels may be involved in airway hyperresponsiveness in allergic asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>]. TRPA1 channels are also involved in non-allergic airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) following exposure to hypochlorite in a mouse model which aims to replicate the AHR reported to occur in swimmers, suggesting that the mechanism of action is partially dependent on TRPA1-dependent stimulation of sensory nerves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>]. The enhanced coughing and sneezing reflexes associated with allergic airways disease would indicate that the afferent nerves become hyperexcitable during allergic inflammation. There may also be hyperinnervation of the airway mucosa in airways disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/118-122\" class=\"abstract_t\">118-122</a>].

Allergic inflammation has been reported to alter function of prejunctional inhibitory muscarinic receptors on airway parasympathetic-cholinergic nerves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>]. Reactivity studies clearly implicate parasympathetic cholinergic nerves in airways hyperresponsiveness. A role for parasympathetic nerves in airways remodeling and inflammation has also been suggested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/126-131\" class=\"abstract_t\">126-131</a>].</p><p>Noncholinergic parasympathetic nerves may also become dysfunctional in airway disease. A failure of airways to dilate with deep inspiration may be a contributing mechanism of airways hyperresponsiveness in asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/132\" class=\"abstract_t\">132</a>]. Noncholinergic parasympathetic nerves mediate bronchodilatation in part through nitric oxide (NO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/28,30,31,70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,30,31,70,71</a>]. Release of inhibitory NO during inhalational challenge may be attenuated in patients with asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/133\" class=\"abstract_t\">133</a>]. Inhibiting NO synthesis prevents the bronchoprotective effects of deep inspiration and induces airways hyperresponsiveness to bradykinin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/134,135\" class=\"abstract_t\">134,135</a>]. Moreover, mutation of the gene encoding the neuronal isoform of NO synthase is associated with a decreased concentration of exhaled nitric oxide, increased airways responsiveness, and an increased risk for developing asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/136,137\" class=\"abstract_t\">136,137</a>].</p><p>Allergic inflammation may alter airway responses to noncholinergic parasympathetic nerve stimulation. Inhalation of allergen by a sensitizing individual reduces the ability of airway noncholinergic parasympathetic nerves and associated neurotransmitters to initiate bronchodilation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bronchoprotection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/9,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,28</a>]. This may be due in part to an upregulation of arginase, which depletes the airways of the precursor for nitric oxide (arginine), or to an upregulation of glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase (also known as S-nitrosoglutathione [GSNO] reductase) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/138-141\" class=\"abstract_t\">138-141</a>]. GSNO reductase depletes the airways of the bronchodilator S-nitrosothiols, which form from precursors nitric oxide and thiol-containing compounds in the airways. Mast cell peptidases may also prevent relaxant responses evoked by the bronchodilating neurotransmitters vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP), and peptide histidine methionine (PHM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/9,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,28</a>].</p><p>Mediators of allergic inflammation such as histamine, prostaglandin D2, and the cysteinyl-leukotrienes are known to enhance neuronal excitability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/2,8,9,21,142\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8,9,21,142</a>]. Other mediators associated with allergic responses of the airways, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1b (IL-1b), chemokines, and eosinophil cationic proteins, are also known to activate or increase excitability of visceral sensory nerves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/2,143-146\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,143-146</a>].</p><p>Neurotrophins are a family of growth factors that include nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurotrophin -3 and -4 (NT-3, NT-4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/147\" class=\"abstract_t\">147</a>]. Neurotrophins elicit functional responses by binding to tyrosine kinase (Trk) receptors. NGF binds with high affinity to tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA); BDNF and NT-4 to TrkB; and NT-3 binds to TrkC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/148\" class=\"abstract_t\">148</a>]. More recently another family of neurotrophic factors have been described that can induce neural plasticity called the glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)-family ligands including GDNF, artemin, neurturin, and persephin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/149\" class=\"abstract_t\">149</a>]. These ligands bind with high affinity to receptors; GDNF to GFR-alpha1, neurturin to GFR-alpha2, artemin to GFR-alpha3, and persephin to GFR-alpha4. These receptors also use RET (rearranged during transfection) receptor, a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family, as a cosignaling molecule. Neurotrophins are thought to contribute to allergen-induced neuronal hyperresponsiveness in asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/150,151\" class=\"abstract_t\">150,151</a>]. </p><p>Neurotrophins, such as NGF, are found in the airways and serum of allergic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/7,151-155\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,151-155</a>].

Endogenous inflammatory mediators that evoke cough (eg, PGE<sub>2 </sub>and bradykinin) are often elevated in respiratory disease states (eg, asthma, COPD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/173,174\" class=\"abstract_t\">173,174</a>]. Furthermore, increased PGE<sub>2</sub> levels have been found in idiopathic cough and cough associated with post nasal drip, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, cough variant asthma, and eosinophilic bronchitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/175\" class=\"abstract_t\">175</a>]. Ion channels of the Transient Receptor Potential class such as TRPV1 have been implicated in the afferent sensory loop of the cough reflex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/92,176\" class=\"abstract_t\">92,176</a>]. Data would support a role for TRPA1 and TRPV1 as common effectors of the tussive response to endogenous tussive agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. </p><p>TRPV1 has also been implicated in the heightened cough sensitivity seen in patients with chronic idiopathic cough [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>]. In models of allergic inflammation, mechanosensitive A-delta neurons undergo a phenotype change, expressing TRPV1, similar to the expression of TRPV1 in jugular C fibers under normal conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/177\" class=\"abstract_t\">177</a>]. The allergen-mediated TRPV1 induction was reproduced by intratracheal administration of BDNF or GDNF to the airway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/177\" class=\"abstract_t\">177</a>]. Furthermore, combined functional and population-based genetic epidemiological studies provide evidence for the involvement of TRPV1, in symptoms typically associated with asthma (eg, wheezing and cough) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/178\" class=\"abstract_t\">178</a>]. In some studies the cough reflex sensitivity to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capsaicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capsaicin</a> challenge is increased in patients with COPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/179,180\" class=\"abstract_t\">179,180</a>] and this phenotype is reproduced in a guinea-pig &quot;disease&quot; model following cigarette smoke exposure indicating that TRPV1 channels could be common effectors of tussive responses in this disease and that increased activity of these channels could be associated with long-term potentiation of the cough reflex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/181\" class=\"abstract_t\">181</a>]. Interestingly, TRPV1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms may enhance susceptibility to cough in current smokers and in subjects with a history of respiratory irritant exposures in the workplace [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/182\" class=\"abstract_t\">182</a>]. On the other hand, an increase in cough reflex sensitivity to capsaicin in patients with chronic idiopathic cough did not predict the efficacy of TRPV1 antagonists in this patient group, based on two negative clinical trials of TRPV1 antagonists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/183,184\" class=\"abstract_t\">183,184</a>].</p><p>An additional ion channel appears to be involved in the pathophysiology of treatment resistant cough. Preclinical studies suggest that P2X3 receptors are expressed by airway vagal afferent nerves and contribute to the activation of sensory neurons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Furthermore, a P2X3 receptor antagonist, AF-219 reduced cough frequency by 75 percent in patients with chronic idiopathic cough and that this was accompanied by significant improvements in cough-specific quality of life and global ratings of change scores. Therefore, antagonists of P2X3 receptors such as AF-219 are being recognized as a promising new group of antitussives. However, a safety issue was identified with AF-219 as it caused taste disturbance; it will be interesting to see whether dose ranging studies can identify if these taste disturbances can be dissociated from the beneficial antitussive effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/185\" class=\"abstract_t\">185</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults#H729443886\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of subacute and chronic cough in adults&quot;, section on 'Future directions'</a>.)</p><p>Mechanoreceptors and C-fibers mediate similar reflex effects in the airways and it is not surprising that these afferent nerve subtypes might act synergistically to initiate reflexes. Such synergistic interactions are facilitated by the convergence of the central nerve terminals of these afferent nerves in key integrative sites in the brainstem such as the commissural nucleus of the solitary tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. These interactions would be analogous to the processes initiating hyperalgesia and pain sensations in somatic tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/156\" class=\"abstract_t\">156</a>]. In the somatic nervous system, neurotransmitters released from the central nerve terminals of nociceptors facilitate synaptic neurotransmission at relay neurons of mechanoreceptors in a process known as central sensitization.</p><p>Evidence for central sensitizing effects of airway nociceptors on cough and reflex bronchoconstriction, similar to the synergistic interactions in hyperalgesia, has been found in animal studies of the effect on cough reflexes of injecting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capsaicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capsaicin</a>, substance P, and neurokinin antagonists into the nucleus solitarius [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/186,187\" class=\"abstract_t\">186,187</a>]. Interactions between afferent nerve subtypes at central integrative sites may explain how extrapulmonary disorders, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/188,189\" class=\"abstract_t\">188,189</a>], allergic rhinitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], and upper respiratory tract infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuronal-control-of-the-airways/abstract/190,191\" class=\"abstract_t\">190,191</a>] influence pulmonary symptoms such as cough and reflex bronchospasm and perhaps airways hyperresponsiveness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7079462\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nerves innervating the airway mucosa initiate homeostatic and defensive reflexes that contribute to the regulation of airway caliber and mucous production and the initiation of reflexes, such as sneeze and cough. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves innervate the vasculature and glands of the nasal mucosa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F52778\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52778 \">figure 2</a>).
