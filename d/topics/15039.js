The NIV group had lower mortality and a shorter length of ICU stay. In addition, the NIV group was less likely to experience treatment failure, which was defined as needing invasive mechanical ventilation for the NIV group and failing to wean for the invasive mechanical ventilation group. These results must be interpreted with caution because the groups differed. The NIV group had a higher vital capacity and half received a mini-tracheostomy to assist with secretion clearance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective cohort study of 17 patients with neuromuscular disease who received NIV for acute respiratory failure (24 episodes), 79 percent did not progress to invasive mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-muscle-weakness-due-to-neuromuscular-disease-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Some patients with neuromuscular disease can expect inexorable progression of their underlying disease process even with long term respiratory support, although the rate of disease progression varies. Patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, for example, rarely choose permanent assisted ventilation with tracheostomy, based on issues related to quality of life and expectations of worsening disability. Discussions about patients&rsquo; desires regarding long-term care decisions are an integral part of the care of such patients; there should never be a time when the patient is not responsible for decisions regarding long-term support. Progressive neuromuscular diseases of childhood, such as spinal muscular atrophy and Duchenne muscular dystrophy present different challenges, as parents are often the main decision makers. In these diseases, long-term ventilatory support is more common and often associated with good quality of life. For these patients, as with adult patients, a clear understanding of the decision-maker&rsquo;s expectations is essential. Palliative care teams can help to facilitate discussions regarding patients&rsquo; goals and preferences and can provide ongoing care if the goals are to focus on palliation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethical-issues-in-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ethical issues in palliative care&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supportive management of respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular disease can provide symptomatic relief, improve quality of life, and prolong life. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subjective clinical findings and objective physiologic tests are used together to determine when mechanical ventilation is indicated, as described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-muscle-weakness-due-to-neuromuscular-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular disease: Clinical manifestations and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Assess need for ventilatory support'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once it is determined that mechanical ventilation is necessary, options for mechanical ventilation include noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIV) or invasive positive pressure ventilation (ie, conventional mechanical ventilation).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with neuromuscular disease who need continuous mechanical ventilation for a short duration (ie, days) or intermittent mechanical ventilation for a long duration (ie, years), we suggest a trial of NIV if no contraindications exist (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Other patients with neuromuscular disease who require ventilatory support should proceed directly to invasive positive pressure ventilation. Monitoring of the adequacy of ventilation can be done noninvasively by measuring transcutaneous PCO<sub>2</sub>. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Noninvasive ventilation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tracheostomy is indicated for patients with neuromuscular disease who have difficulty clearing their secretions, who require intermittent long-term mechanical ventilation but in whom NIV is contraindicated, whose chronic respiratory failure has worsened and intermittent long-term NIV is no longer sufficient, or who fail to wean from invasive mechanical ventilation. (See <a href=\"#H2765644428\" class=\"local\">'Tracheostomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mechanical ventilation is associated with numerous complications; therefore, it should be discontinued as soon as possible. The process of discontinuing mechanical ventilation is identical in patients with and without neuromuscular disease. However, extra caution is warranted when deciding whether to discontinue mechanical ventilation in patients with neuromuscular disease because the likelihood of failure is high among such patients. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Discontinuing ventilatory support'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An ineffective cough predisposes patients with neuromuscular disease to aspiration, pneumonia, and respiratory failure. For all patients with an ineffective cough, we recommend an intervention to improve the cough and secretion clearance (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). For most patients, we suggest mechanical insufflation-exsufflation, rather than manually-assisted coughing, hyperinflation maneuvers, or secretion mobilization techniques (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Cough assistance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When managing patients with respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular disease, particular care should be taken to correct electrolyte abnormalities and avoid factors that may further compromise respiratory muscle function. An adequate nutritional status should be maintained, but overfeeding must be avoided. Among hospitalized patients, prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism and stress gastric ulcers should be provided when indicated. The head of the bed should be elevated by 45&ordm; to decrease the risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'General care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with respiratory failure due to neuromuscular disease, it is particularly important for clinicians to understand the patients' values and goals for medical care (eg, restoring health, extending life, or relieving pain and suffering).
