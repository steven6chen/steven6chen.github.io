Despite the decreasing prevalence of smoking, there is an increasing incidence of oropharyngeal cancers, particularly in younger adults. </p><p>These trends are related to an increase in oropharyngeal cancers caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection; these cancers arise predominantly in the tonsillar area and the base of the tongue. Although most of the HPV associated oropharyngeal cancers present with locoregionally advanced disease, these tumors have a better prognosis than those related to tobacco and alcohol use. There are currently are no differences in the treatment approach, although many prospective clinical trials are investigating treatment de-escalation in HPV positive oropharynx cancers.

Unlike the 2010 version of the TNM staging system, the eighth edition distinguishes between HPV related oropharyngeal carcinoma and p16 negative tumors of the oropharynx.</p><p>The TNM staging system for HPV related oropharyngeal cancer is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-associated-head-and-neck-cancer#H1207904748\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human papillomavirus associated head and neck cancer&quot;, section on 'TNM staging system'</a>.)</p><p>By definition, patients with early (stage I and II) disease have tumors &le;4 cm in greatest dimension without invasion into surrounding structures and with no clinical or radiographic evidence of lymph node involvement. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H636375187\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H636375735\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery versus RT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early squamous cell carcinomas of the oropharynx can be treated with either primary surgery or definitive radiation therapy (RT) as a single modality. Definitive RT and primary surgery have yielded similar rates of local control and survival in retrospective studies, although there are no prospective randomized trials comparing the two approaches. The morbidity associated with each treatment approach is an important factor in making treatment decisions.</p><p>RT is used more commonly, but surgery may be preferred in selected situations. Minimally invasive techniques, such as transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) and transoral robotic surgery (TORS), have made resection of carefully selected early oropharyngeal cancers both feasible and well tolerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oropharynx/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H636375742\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The dosing of RT to the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes, and the optimal techniques for radiation administration are discussed separately, as are the complications associated with RT.

Thus, elective treatment of the neck should be strongly considered. Elective treatment of the neck can be accomplished with either nodal dissection or RT. </p><p>Early tonsil cancers without soft palate or base of tongue involvement are considered lateralized primaries, and elective nodal treatment can involve either selective neck dissection (levels two to four) in patients undergoing primary surgery (transoral or open) or ipsilateral elective nodal dissection in patients undergoing definitive RT.</p><p>However, it is important to address both sides of the neck for base of tongue, soft palate, and posterior pharyngeal wall primary tumors as these are considered midline structures, which can have bilateral lymphatic drainage. For patients with midline tumors managed with definitive RT, bilateral neck irradiation is recommended. For patients who initially undergo primary surgery of midline tumors, bilateral selective neck dissection including levels two to four is recommended (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F54099\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54099 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oropharynx/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H636375194\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIFIC TUMOR SITES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Soft palate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with early cancer of the soft palate are usually treated with radiation therapy (RT) to the primary tumor and to the bilateral necks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oropharynx/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Locoregional control and survival with RT are comparable to outcomes with surgery. However, primary surgery is generally associated with greater functional impairment, particularly velopharyngeal insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oropharynx/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. If primary surgery for soft palate cancers is considered, then rehabilitation with a free flap or obturator is necessary, unless the defect is not through and through. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mandibular-and-palatal-reconstruction-in-patients-with-head-and-neck-cancer#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mandibular and palatal reconstruction in patients with head and neck cancer&quot;, section on 'Soft palate reconstruction'</a>.)</p><p>For patients with stage I soft palate cancers, five-year locoregional control, cause-specific survival, and overall survival rates of 84, 89, and 52 percent, respectively, have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oropharynx/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].

The majority of cases of tonsillar cancer are now human papilloma virus (HPV) related. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-associated-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human papillomavirus associated head and neck cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>With newer transoral approaches (robotic or laser), functional outcomes with both definitive RT and primary surgery are extremely good in carefully selected patients. In one series, reported five-year local control and cause-specific survival rates following initial RT were 88 and 100 percent for stage I disease, and 84 and 86 percent for stage II disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oropharynx/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

If primary surgery is used for tumors that extend beyond the tonsil itself, the pharyngeal wall <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> soft palate should be included in the resection.</p><p>For more extensive but still early stage tumors, there are several historical open surgical approaches, including an anterior approach (a combined lip splitting incision coupled with an anterior midline or lateral mandibulotomy) and a transhyoid approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oropharynx/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. However, transoral approaches have largely replaced open procedures for early stage oropharynx primary tumors. The multidisciplinary tumor board should weigh the treatment-related morbidity of either a primary surgery or a definitive radiation approach as it relates to the particular defect. </p><p>Transoral laser microsurgery (TLS) and transoral robotic surgery (TORS) avoid the morbidity associated with the anterior approach and have been associated with significantly improved outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oropharynx/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Recent reports suggest that TORS alone provides high local control and is associated with low surgical morbidity in patients with early stage tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oropharynx/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Base of tongue</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Squamous cell carcinomas arising at the base of tongue are considered midline structures with bilateral lymphatic drainage, so elective treatment of bilateral necks is essential.

Elective RT is recommended to the lymph node basins at risk for patients who are treated with primary RT, while lymph node dissection is recommended for patients who underwent surgical resection.</p><p>Surgery for early unilateral base of tongue cancer consists of hemiglossectomy. These tumors have been traditionally removed by resecting the mandible or using a translabial transmandibular approach. However, these procedures involve significant morbidity, including lip and chin scars, malocclusion, compromised swallowing, chronic aspiration, and altered speech articulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oropharynx/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Several investigators have reported success with transpharyngeal approaches, which allow wide exposure of the tongue base and superior tonsil, and avoid the potential complications of mandibular osteotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oropharynx/abstract/14,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,21,22</a>]. With the advent of TORS and TLM, primary surgery and definitive RT are now equivalent options in properly selected patients. One must recognize that patients treated with primary surgery who have positive margins will require RT, and patients with other adverse features (many positive nodes, extranodal extension) will be upstaged and may require chemoradiation in addition to primary surgery. </p><p>TLM uses an endoscope to view the pharynx through the mouth and a laser to excise the tumor. For appropriately selected patients with base of tongue cancers, TLM may improve local control and functional results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oropharynx/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. As an example, one study reported two-year local control and survival of 100 and 92 percent for T1 lesions, and 87 and 91 percent for T2 lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oropharynx/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Compared with conventional open surgery, TLM minimizes the risk of fistula, flap failure, abscess, or osteoradionecrosis and is associated with a shorter hospital stay. However, postoperative hemorrhage occurs in 5 to 10 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oropharynx/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Similar results have been obtained with TORS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oropharynx/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. A large multi-institutional retrospective cohort study demonstrated excellent oncologic outcomes using TORS within the multidisciplinary treatment paradigm for oropharynx cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oropharynx/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].
