This leads to impairment of ventricular filling in mid and late diastole. As a result, the majority of ventricular filling occurs rapidly in early diastole and the ventricular volume does not increase after the end of the early filling period.</p><p>Restrictive cardiomyopathy is characterized by a nondilated rigid ventricle, resulting in severe diastolic dysfunction and restrictive filling that produces hemodynamic changes similar to those in constrictive pericarditis. </p><p>Constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy both lead to diastolic heart failure with normal (or near normal) systolic function, and characteristically abnormal ventricular filling that results in similar clinical and hemodynamic features. However, because of their markedly different treatments, differentiating between the two conditions is critical. In some patients, the correct diagnosis may be readily suggested from the history or routine diagnostic testing. In others, however, this differentiation cannot be diagnosed before biopsy or even surgical exploration. </p><p>The distinction between constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy will be reviewed here. The basic aspects of constrictive pericarditis and idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=constrictive-pericarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Constrictive pericarditis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=idiopathic-restrictive-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30200245\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF RESPIRATORY EFFECTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An understanding of ventricular volume constraints and ventricular interaction is key in any discussion of the hemodynamic differences between constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy.</p><p>In patients with constrictive pericarditis, total cardiac volume is fixed by the noncompliant pericardium. The septum is not involved and can therefore bulge toward the left ventricle when left ventricular volume is less than that on the right. As a result, ventricular interdependence is greatly enhanced. This bulging may be seen on echocardiography, or in some cases, on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-constrictive-pericarditis-and-restrictive-cardiomyopathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, changes in intrathoracic pressure are not transmitted to the cardiac chambers because of obliteration of the pericardial space. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=constrictive-pericarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Constrictive pericarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In restrictive cardiomyopathy, on the other hand, pericardial compliance is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is normal, or in severe cases, may even be reduced. The respiratory variation in intrathoracic pressure is transmitted normally to the cardiac chambers.</p><p>The different effects of respiration on ventricular filling between the two diseases may be explained by the following mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with constrictive pericarditis, the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is influenced by the inspiratory fall in intra-thoracic pressure, while the left ventricular pressure is shielded from respiratory pressure variations by the pericardial scar. Thus, inspiration lowers the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and presumably left atrial pressure, but not left ventricular diastolic pressure, thereby decreasing the pressure gradient for ventricular filling. The less favorable filling pressure gradient during inspiration explains the decline in filling velocity. Reciprocal changes occur in the velocity of right ventricular filling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-constrictive-pericarditis-and-restrictive-cardiomyopathy/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. These changes are mediated by the ventricular septum, not by increased systemic venous return.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy, inspiration lowers pulmonary wedge and left ventricular diastolic pressures equally, thereby leaving the pressure gradient for ventricular filling and filling velocity virtually unchanged.</p><p/><p>A lower left ventricular filling pressure gradient with constrictive pericarditis also leads to a delay in mitral valve opening and therefore, a longer isovolumic relaxation time during inspiration. This inspiration decline in the filling gradient is seen in constrictive pericarditis but not restrictive cardiomyopathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the evaluation of a patient with suspected constrictive pericarditis or restrictive cardiomyopathy, the history can provide important clues to other systemic disorders which could predispose to either condition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F99929\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef99929 \">algorithm 1</a>). In addition, while most patients with constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy present with symptoms of heart failure, subtle differences in physical findings may suggest a particular diagnosis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the evaluation of constrictive pericarditis versus restrictive cardiomyopathy, the history is most valuable in identifying a systemic disorder which can predispose to either constrictive pericarditis or restrictive cardiomyopathy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prior history of pericarditis, trauma, cardiac surgery, or a systemic disease that affects the pericardium (eg, tuberculosis, connective tissue disease, malignancy) makes the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis more likely.

From the JVP waveform alone, it is not possible to distinguish between constrictive pericarditis, restrictive cardiomyopathy, tricuspid regurgitation with an enlarged compliant right atrium, or right heart failure (eg, due to right ventricular infarction or pulmonary hypertension). The contour of the jugular venous pulse in all these conditions is dominated by a deep, steep Y descent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=examination-of-the-jugular-venous-pulse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Examination of the jugular venous pulse&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Additional physical examination findings in patients with constrictive pericarditis or restrictive cardiomyopathy can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kussmaul's sign (the lack of an inspiratory decline in JVP)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulsus paradoxus (uncommon)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral edema</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ascites and hepatomegaly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pleural effusions. </p><p/><p>Approximately 50 percent of patients with constrictive pericarditis may present with a pericardial knock (an accentuated heart sound occurring slightly earlier than a third heart sound, which may be audible and rarely is palpable), which is not expected in restrictive cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-constrictive-pericarditis-and-restrictive-cardiomyopathy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Conversely, an audible S3 is frequently present in persons with restrictive cardiomyopathy because of the abrupt cessation of the rapid ventricular filling; this is not usually present in constrictive pericarditis.

While a particular diagnosis is often made following echocardiography, patients commonly undergo cardiac catheterization, during which invasive hemodynamic evaluation can help elucidate the correct diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-constrictive-pericarditis-and-restrictive-cardiomyopathy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In most patients, particularly those with prior radiation exposure, there is a role for computed tomography (CT) or cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-constrictive-pericarditis-and-restrictive-cardiomyopathy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Both CT and CMR provide additional detailed anatomic information about adjacent vascular structures and an accurate measurement of pericardial thickness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrocardiogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The electrocardiogram may be helpful in distinguishing constrictive pericarditis from restrictive cardiomyopathy. Depolarization abnormalities (such as bundle branch block), ventricular hypertrophy, pathologic Q waves, or impaired atrioventricular conduction strongly favor restrictive cardiomyopathy. Low voltage and isolated repolarization abnormalities can occur in both conditions, although the latter are more common in constrictive pericarditis. Atrial fibrillation is common in the late stages of both diseases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=constrictive-pericarditis#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Constrictive pericarditis&quot;, section on 'Electrocardiography'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=idiopathic-restrictive-cardiomyopathy#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy&quot;, section on 'Electrocardiogram'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H740032\"><span class=\"h2\">Plasma BNP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plasma concentrations of B type natriuretic peptide (BNP) are increased in numerous conditions, most notably in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. As a result, plasma BNP has been used in the diagnosis of dyspnea and to assess the efficacy of therapy and estimate prognosis in patients with heart failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Natriuretic peptide measurement in heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>BNP is released in response to left ventricular dysfunction and wall stretch. Wall stretch is increased in restrictive cardiomyopathy. However, in constrictive pericarditis, the myocardium is normal, and stretch is limited by the thickened pericardium. These physiologic differences suggest that measurement of plasma BNP might have value in distinguishing between these two disorders.</p><p>The usefulness of BNP in differentiating constrictive pericarditis from restrictive cardiomyopathy has been evaluated in several small studies (each with between 11 and 33 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-constrictive-pericarditis-and-restrictive-cardiomyopathy/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Mean BNP levels in patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy have generally been significantly higher than BNP levels seen in patients with constrictive pericarditis. In addition, many patients with constrictive pericarditis had BNP levels at or below 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL,</span> a level generally considered the threshold for a normal BNP value. However, one study reported considerable overlap of the measured BNP levels between patients with constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy when the BNP value was less than 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-constrictive-pericarditis-and-restrictive-cardiomyopathy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>While the data are intriguing, these observations need to be confirmed in a larger number of patients to more thoroughly determine the accuracy of BNP testing for differentiating constrictive pericarditis from restrictive cardiomyopathy. However, because the physiologic rationale is strong, we recommend measurement of plasma BNP early in the evaluation of patients with suspected constrictive pericarditis as a normal value (BNP &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL)</span> essentially excludes restrictive cardiomyopathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Chest radiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Calcification of the pericardium strongly suggests constrictive pericarditis, but it can also be seen in other conditions, such as asbestosis, which may or may not be associated with constrictive pericarditis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64005\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64005 \">image 1</a>). However, the absence of calcification is equally compatible with either diagnosis. In one retrospective review of 135 patients with constrictive pericarditis confirmed surgically or at autopsy, only 27 percent had pericardial calcification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-constrictive-pericarditis-and-restrictive-cardiomyopathy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The cause of constrictive pericarditis was more likely to be indeterminant when calcification was seen (67 versus 21 percent in the absence of calcification). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=constrictive-pericarditis#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Constrictive pericarditis&quot;, section on 'Chest radiograph'</a>.)</p><p>Mild cardiomegaly on chest radiography is common in both conditions, but more prominent in restrictive cardiomyopathy. This is generally due to atrial rather than ventricular enlargement. Pulmonary venous congestion with or without pleural effusions can be seen in restrictive cardiomyopathy but would not be expected in constrictive pericarditis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=idiopathic-restrictive-cardiomyopathy#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy&quot;, section on 'Chest radiograph'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Pericardial imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no association between increased pericardial thickness and restrictive cardiomyopathy. However, constrictive pericarditis is usually associated with increased thickness of the pericardium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73214\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73214 \">image 2</a>). A pericardial thickness exceeding 4 mm is highly suggestive of constrictive pericarditis. However, constrictive pericarditis can also occur in the setting of a non-thickened pericardium. Thus, a normal appearing parietal pericardium does not rule out constrictive pericarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-constrictive-pericarditis-and-restrictive-cardiomyopathy/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Pericardial thickness can be evaluated using a variety of imaging techniques, including echocardiography, computed tomography (CT), and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=constrictive-pericarditis#H274012956\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Constrictive pericarditis&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>While transthoracic echocardiography is the most frequently imaging modality used in the assessment of suspected pericardial disease, it is also one of the least sensitive for detecting pericardial thickening. In a review of 143 patients with surgically confirmed constrictive pericarditis, a pathologically thickened pericardium (&gt;4 mm) was seen in 82 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-constrictive-pericarditis-and-restrictive-cardiomyopathy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Approximately 40 percent of patients with constrictive pericarditis had pericardial thickening seen on transthoracic echocardiography. In contrast, pericardial thickness on transesophageal imaging correlates strongly with that obtained by CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-constrictive-pericarditis-and-restrictive-cardiomyopathy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>In comparison to transthoracic echocardiography, CT and CMR imaging are more sensitive for the detection of increased pericardial thickness. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-constrictive-pericarditis-and-restrictive-cardiomyopathy/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>] In a review of 143 patients with surgically confirmed constrictive pericarditis, pericardial thickening was seen by CT imaging in 86 percent of patients (compared to 43 percent with pericardial thickening seen by transthoracic echocardiography) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-constrictive-pericarditis-and-restrictive-cardiomyopathy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. CMR is similar to CT in its ability to detect pericardial thickening. CMR has a reported accuracy of 93 percent for the ability to detect pericardial thickening of greater than 4 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-constrictive-pericarditis-and-restrictive-cardiomyopathy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Doppler echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to its role in evaluating pericardial thickness, transthoracic echocardiography allows for Doppler assessment of hemodynamics, thereby providing significant information that can aid in diagnosing (and differentiating) constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy. Restrictive cardiomyopathy and constrictive pericarditis share many important hemodynamic characteristics and therefore, have a number of Doppler characteristics in common, most notably a restrictive mitral inflow or ventricular filling pattern (measured as mitral E velocity), with striking E dominance and a short deceleration time (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F59321\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef59321 \">waveform 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72146\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72146 \">table 1</a>). These findings indicate early rapid filling and are seen in both entities.</p><p>However, Doppler echocardiography can also provide clues to differentiating constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respirophasic changes in intrathoracic pressure and ventricular filling &ndash; The respiratory variation in ventricular filling velocity in restrictive cardiomyopathy is usually minimal (less than 10 percent), while patients with constrictive pericarditis may have respiratory variations as high as 30 to 40 percent in ventricular filling velocity (similar to that seen in cardiac tamponade) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F51257\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51257 \">image 3</a>). An echocardiographic study of 30 patients (19 with constrictive pericarditis and 11 with restrictive cardiomyopathy) found that significant respiratory variation in the ventricular inflow peak velocity &ge;10 percent predicted constrictive pericarditis with a sensitivity and specificity of 84 and 91 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-constrictive-pericarditis-and-restrictive-cardiomyopathy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].<br/><br/>However, the ventricular filling velocity is highly influenced by the level of the left atrial pressure. When left atrial pressure is greatly elevated in a patient with constrictive pericarditis, respiratory variation in ventricular filling may not be observed, whereas patients with lower left atrial pressure (ie, due to volume depletion or earlier stage of disease) may have more noticeable changes in ventricular filling velocities with respiration. Left atrial pressure can be reduced on physical examination by asking a patient to move from the supine to seated position; such a maneuver may elicit the abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-constrictive-pericarditis-and-restrictive-cardiomyopathy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].<br/><br/>The ability to assess respirophasic changes in ventricular filling velocities is challenging in patients with atrial fibrillation, due to the presence of variable cardiac cycle length from beat to beat. While some investigators have suggested that respiratory variation can be accurately assessed in patients with atrial fibrillation, we find this to be quite challenging in the average patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-constrictive-pericarditis-and-restrictive-cardiomyopathy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].<br/><br/>Respiratory variation in mitral E velocity, as with pulsus paradoxus on physical examination, is not specific to constrictive pericarditis and is frequently seen in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In an attempt to distinguish between constrictive pericarditis and COPD, the pulsed-wave Doppler recordings of mitral and superior vena cava flow velocities were compared in 20 patients with COPD who had a 25 percent respiratory variation in mitral E-wave velocity and 20 patients with surgically proven constrictive pericarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-constrictive-pericarditis-and-restrictive-cardiomyopathy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The patients with pulmonary disease had a marked increase in inspiratory superior vena cava systolic flow velocity which was not seen in those with constrictive pericarditis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F53288\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef53288 \">waveform 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatic venous flow &ndash; Measurement of hepatic venous flow can help to distinguish constrictive pericarditis from restrictive cardiomyopathy. In patients with constrictive pericarditis, there is a reversal of forward flow during expiration, since the right ventricle becomes less compliant as the left ventricle fills more. In contrast, reversal of hepatic vein flow occurs during inspiration in restrictive cardiomyopathy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary regurgitant flow velocity &ndash; Reflecting the characteristic diastolic RV pressure pattern in constrictive pericarditis, velocities at the early diastolic peak, mid-diastolic inflection point, and late diastolic minimal point of the continuous-wave Doppler waveform of pulmonary regurgitation were lower in patients with constrictive pericarditis (n = 15) than in patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy (n = 18) and normal subjects (n = 20) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-constrictive-pericarditis-and-restrictive-cardiomyopathy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Color M-mode flow propagation &ndash; Early diastolic color M-mode Doppler shows an excessively rapid transit of blood flow from the mitral orifice to the apex in constrictive pericarditis, whereas the transit is much slower than normal in restrictive cardiomyopathy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Tissue Doppler imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tissue Doppler imaging provides additional information on myocardial function which can help to distinguish constrictive pericarditis from restrictive cardiomyopathy.

Despite excellent specificity of E' for differentiating restrictive cardiomyopathy from constrictive pericarditis, its sensitivity is more modest.<br/><br/>Unlike in normal individuals, mitral lateral (and tricuspid) annular E' velocities are often relatively reduced in patients with constrictive pericarditis (&quot;annular reversus&quot;). This reduction may be the result of lateral adhesion of the pericardium while the longitudinal movement of the septal annulus is unimpeded. These mechanics are not evident in restrictive cardiomyopathy. Thus, the ratio between lateral (both mitral and tricuspid) and septal annuli velocities is reduced in patients with constrictive pericarditis compared with that in patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy (and controls) and may be useful to discriminate these groups of patients. In a study of 37 patients with constrictive pericarditis, 35 patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy (the majority with amyloidosis) and 70 normal controls, the lateral <span class=\"nowrap\">E'/septal</span> E' ratios were 0.94&plusmn;0.17, 1.35&plusmn;0.31, and 1.36&plusmn;0.24, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-constrictive-pericarditis-and-restrictive-cardiomyopathy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Of note, in a study of 130 patients with surgically confirmed constrictive pericarditis, the variables independently associated with constriction were ventricular septal shift, medial mitral e', and hepatic vein expiratory diastolic reversal ratio.

Elevation and equalization of diastolic filling pressures occurs in patients with constrictive pericarditis. Although these hemodynamic findings may occur in patients with other cardiac disorders, their presence is required for the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis. Diastolic equalization may not be present in patients with constrictive pericarditis in the event of preceding diuresis and a low volume state, as well as in patients with relatively early stage disease. In patients with a low volume state, however, the cardiac output will be low. Therefore, the presence of normal cardiac output with normal filling pressures precludes the presence of hemodynamically significant constrictive pericarditis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>End-diastolic pressures &ndash; Right and left ventricular end-diastolic pressures (RVEDP and LVEDP) are equal or nearly equal in constrictive pericarditis, while LVEDP is usually higher than RVEDP in restrictive cardiomyopathy. However, in many cases of restrictive cardiomyopathy the plateau of diastolic pressure is equally elevated in both ventricles, as typically occurs in constrictive pericarditis. If the pressures are approximately equal, a fluid bolus, exercise, or pharmacologic maneuver should theoretically increase LVEDP above RVEDP in restrictive cardiomyopathy, but the data supporting this theory are not convincing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-constrictive-pericarditis-and-restrictive-cardiomyopathy/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. The sensitivity and specificity of such maneuvers are not known; therefore, the diagnostic benefit of these maneuvers is uncertain.<br/><br/>The predictive accuracy of conventional catheterization criteria was 75 percent in 100 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac catheterization to differentiate constrictive pericarditis (n = 59) from restrictive cardiomyopathy (n = 41). Use of a novel &quot;systolic area index&quot; ratio (right ventricular to left ventricular systolic pressure-time area during inspiration versus expiration) that estimated enhanced ventricular interdependence had a sensitivity of 97 percent and a predictive accuracy of 100 percent for the identification of patients with surgically documented constrictive pericarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-constrictive-pericarditis-and-restrictive-cardiomyopathy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dip and plateau sign &ndash; The first observations of the dip and plateau configuration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F69264\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef69264 \">waveform 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F81335\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81335 \">figure 3</a>) of ventricular pressure (also called the square root sign) during diastole led investigators to theorize that ventricular filling during early diastole must be unusually rapid and aided by augmented suction, and that ventricular filling must be halted by pericardial restraint from the end of the first third of diastole onward [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-constrictive-pericarditis-and-restrictive-cardiomyopathy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. This conjecture was verified after it became possible to record the pattern of ventricular filling by ventriculography and subsequently by other imaging techniques. Although some disagree, most authors believe (as we do) that the same dip and plateau waveform characterizes restrictive cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-constrictive-pericarditis-and-restrictive-cardiomyopathy/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Equalization of pressures &ndash; Equalization of filling pressures in the four cardiac chambers is commonly said to be a major hemodynamic criterion for the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis. This statement may be an oversimplification for two reasons:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The pulmonary wedge pressure falls during inspiration while systemic venous pressure remains constant. Thus, it is not reasonable to expect the two pressures to be precisely equal throughout the respiratory cycle, and frequently equilibration is present only during inspiration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Equilibration of diastolic pressures occurs in some patients who have heart failure or an acute volume overload, but who do not have constrictive pericarditis.<br/><br/>In addition, pericardial restraint from a dilated heart may cause equilibration of diastolic pressures and may simulate the hemodynamics of constrictive pericarditis. Examples of this phenomenon are found in right ventricular dilation after right ventricular infarction or severe tricuspid insufficiency, as well as in acute mitral regurgitation secondary to rupture of a chorda tendineae.<br/><br/>Pulmonary hypertension and left ventricular diastolic pressure that exceeds that in the right ventricle by &ge;5 mmHg may favor a diagnosis of cardiomyopathy (restrictive or dilated) rather than constrictive pericarditis. However, neither of these findings is highly specific for either diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiating-constrictive-pericarditis-and-restrictive-cardiomyopathy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].<br/><br/>Hemodynamic maneuvers, such as exercise, fluid loading, and observing postextrasystolic beats, have been proposed as a way to cause diastolic pressures (equal in the two ventricles) to differ. Published experience with these approaches is limited. In addition, there may not be equalization of diastolic pressures if a patient with constrictive pericarditis has been on diuretics and has low to normal right atrial pressures. In such patients, fluid loading at the time of catheterization is necessary to attempt to confirm the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory changes &ndash; As noted above, both constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy may have similar findings of early rapid diastolic filling and elevation and equalization of diastolic pressures in all four cardiac chambers. However, the respiratory changes in filling of the left ventricle and right ventricle, as well as the enhanced ventricular interaction seen in constrictive pericarditis, result in distinctive changes in the left ventricular and right ventricular pressures during respiration. (See <a href=\"#H30200245\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology of respiratory effects'</a> above.)<br/><br/>These abnormalities have been described as discordance between the pressures in these two chambers, typically seen as reciprocal changes in stroke volume, pulse pressure, or peak systolic pressure during respiration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73914\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73914 \">figure 4</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>During inspiration, there is less filling of the left ventricle, resulting in a large fall in left ventricular systolic pressure. The reduction in left ventricular filling is due to the fall in the pulmonary wedge pressure and presumably left atrial pressure resulting from the decrease in intrathoracic pressure. In contrast, left ventricular diastolic pressure does not fall since the left ventricular pressure is shielded from respiratory pressure variations by the pericardial scar. The net effect is a reduction in the pressure gradient for ventricular filling.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Due to enhanced ventricular interaction, since the septum can move normally, there is greater filling of the right ventricle and the right ventricular systolic pressure will rise.<br/><br/>These findings are not present in patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy in whom the left ventricular and right ventricular pressures are concordant during the respiratory cycle. Inspiration lowers pulmonary wedge and left ventricular diastolic pressures equally, thereby leaving the pressure gradient for ventricular filling and filling velocity virtually unchanged.

Findings that can aid in distinguishing the two conditions include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History &ndash; The history may provide helpful clues, such as prior pericarditis or a systemic disease predisposing to constrictive pericarditis, or a cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy (eg, diabetes mellitus or amyloidosis). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical Examination &ndash; The vast majority of patients with both constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy display elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), making this physical finding less helpful in distinguishing the two conditions. The presence of a pericardial knock (an accentuated heart sound occurring slightly earlier than a third heart sound) favors constrictive pericarditis, while an audible S3 is frequently present in persons with restrictive cardiomyopathy. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrocardiography &ndash; The electrocardiogram may be helpful in distinguishing constrictive pericarditis from restrictive cardiomyopathy. Depolarization abnormalities (such as bundle branch block), ventricular hypertrophy, pathologic Q waves, or impaired atrioventricular conduction strongly favor restrictive cardiomyopathy. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Electrocardiogram'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) &ndash; BNP is released in response to left ventricular dysfunction and wall stretch. Wall stretch is increased in restrictive cardiomyopathy, whereas in constrictive pericarditis the myocardium is usually normal and myocardial wall stretch is limited by the thickened pericardium. Several small observational studies have suggested that BNP levels in patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy are significantly higher than BNP levels in patients with constrictive pericarditis. Because the physiologic rationale is strong and consistent with these preliminary findings, we recommend measurement of plasma BNP early in the evaluation of patients with suspected constrictive pericarditis as a normal value (BNP &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL)</span> essentially excludes restrictive cardiomyopathy. (See <a href=\"#H740032\" class=\"local\">'Plasma BNP'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest radiography &ndash; Calcification of the pericardium (except for scattered calcified plaques which are more consistent with prior asbestos exposure) strongly suggests constrictive pericarditis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64005\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64005 \">image 1</a>), whereas cardiomegaly on chest radiography (generally due to atrial rather than ventricular enlargement) is more prominent in restrictive cardiomyopathy. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Chest radiography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pericardial imaging &ndash; Increased thickness or calcification of the pericardium favors the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis, although increased pericardial thickness is not present in all patients. Thickening of the ventricular wall and septum, abnormal myocardial texture, and to a lesser extent, mitral or tricuspid regurgitation favor the diagnosis of restrictive cardiomyopathy. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Pericardial imaging'</a> above.)<br/><br/>Doppler echocardiography &ndash; Doppler echocardiography can provide clues to differentiating constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Doppler echocardiography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The respiratory variation in ventricular filling velocity in restrictive cardiomyopathy is usually minimal (less than 10 percent), while patients with constrictive pericarditis may have respiratory variations as high as 30 to 40 percent in ventricular filling velocity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hepatic venous flow reversal is expiratory in constrictive pericarditis, but inspiratory in restrictive cardiomyopathy. Diastolic mitral regurgitation suggests restrictive cardiomyopathy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tissue Doppler imaging &ndash; Tissue Doppler imaging provides additional information on myocardial function which can help to distinguish constrictive pericarditis from restrictive cardiomyopathy. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Tissue Doppler imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The early diastolic Doppler tissue velocity at the mitral annulus (E') is decreased (&lt;8 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/sec)</span> in restrictive cardiomyopathy, due to an intrinsic decrease in myocardial contraction and relaxation. In contrast, the transmitral E' is frequently increased (&gt;12 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/sec)</span> in constrictive pericarditis, since the longitudinal movement of the myocardium is enhanced because of constricted radial motion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F58771\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef58771 \">waveform 3</a>). While E' values &lt;8 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/sec</span> or &gt;12 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/sec</span> are highly specific for restrictive cardiomyopathy or constrictive pericarditis, respectively, many patients will have an E&rsquo; velocity between 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/sec</span> and 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/sec,</span> which is nondiagnostic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The Doppler myocardial velocity gradient, as measured from the left ventricular posterior wall in early diastole and during ventricular ejection, was significantly lower in patients with a restrictive cardiomyopathy compared to those with constrictive pericarditis and to normal controls.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac catheterization &ndash; Right and left ventricular end-diastolic pressures (RVEDP and LVEDP) are equal or very nearly equal in constrictive pericarditis, while LVEDP is usually higher than RVEDP in restrictive cardiomyopathy.
