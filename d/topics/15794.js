In addition, OSA may itself be an independent risk factor for stroke.</p><p>OSA is characterized by the intermittent cessation or reduction of airflow during sleep due to complete or partial upper airway obstruction, while CSA is characterized by the intermittent absence of airflow and ventilatory effort. Cheyne-Stokes breathing refers to cyclic crescendo-decrescendo airflow and respiratory effort during wakefulness or sleep, without upper airway obstruction. Cheyne-Stokes breathing is considered a type of CSA when the decrescendo effort is accompanied by apnea during sleep. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polysomnography-in-the-evaluation-of-sleep-disordered-breathing-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Polysomnography in the evaluation of sleep-disordered breathing in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Clinical signs and symptoms of sleep-related breathing disorders are not reliable in patients with stroke, and diagnostic sleep testing with polysomnography or home sleep apnea testing is required to make the diagnosis. While clinical trials in the general population have demonstrated that treatment of OSA with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or other therapies significantly reduces apneas and oxygen desaturation during sleep and other outcomes, data in stroke patients are more limited.</p><p>The association between OSA and stroke as well as the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of sleep-related breathing disorders following stroke or transient ischemic attack are discussed here. Other cardiovascular complications of OSA and other respiratory abnormalities that can occur after a stroke are described separately.

Confidence in the evidence is increased by the findings of a large effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-and-stroke/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] and a dose-response gradient (ie, correlation between the severity of OSA and the risk for stroke) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-and-stroke/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Several large observational studies demonstrate this effect:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective cohort study followed 5422 individuals without a history of stroke for a median of 8.7 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-and-stroke/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Men whose obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was in the highest quartile were more likely to have an ischemic stroke than men whose AHI was in the lowest quartile, even after adjustment for potential confounders (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.86, 95% CI 1.10-7.39). The highest AHI quartile included patients who had &gt;19.1 respiratory events per hour of sleep, whereas the lowest AHI quartile included patients who had &lt;4.1 respiratory events per hour of sleep.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective cohort study of nearly 1000 women with possible OSA who were free of stroke or coronary heart disease at baseline and were followed for a median of 6.8 years, those with untreated OSA had a significantly increased risk of incident stroke compared with those without OSA (adjusted HR 6.4, 95% CI 1.5-28.3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-and-stroke/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Women with treated OSA did not have an increased risk of stroke (HR 0.9, 95% CI 0.4-2.0).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another large observational study using a universal insurance claims database in Taiwan, women were at higher risk than men, and younger women were at higher risk than older women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-and-stroke/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The incidence of stroke in patients with sleep apnea by polysomnography (n = 29,961) was 52 per 10,000 person-years for males and 62 per 10,000 person-years for females; in controls, the incidence was 41 per 10,000 person-years for males and 37 per 10,000 person-years for females. In women with sleep apnea, the magnitude of the risk of stroke decreased with age (adjusted HR 4.9 for subgroup aged 20 to 35 years; HR 1.6 for subgroup aged 36 to 50 years; HR 1.4 for subgroup aged 51 to 65 years). While the pathophysiology behind this finding could not be determined by the study, the higher risk in women of childbearing age provides support for the recognition and treatment of OSA during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-and-stroke/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

In addition, some of the observational studies described above have found a lower stroke risk in patients with treated versus untreated OSA. The quality of such data is limited, however, and few controlled trials have directly measured the impact of treating OSA on the incidence of stroke. Two trials have reported no difference in the rate of stroke or other cardiovascular events in patients treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-and-stroke/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults#H3409642565\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obstructive sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Cardiovascular events'</a>.)</p><p>In patients with established cerebrovascular disease, limited data suggest that treatment of sleep-disordered breathing may improve stroke-related outcomes, particularly in the early post-stroke setting. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104240922\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several mechanisms by which OSA may increase the risk of stroke.</p><p>One possibility is that cerebral blood flow velocity is decreased by the negative intrathoracic pressure that is typically generated during an obstructive apnea. Alternatively, cerebrovascular dilatory responses to hypoxia in patients with OSA may be decreased due to intermittent hypoxia, oxidant-mediated endothelial dysfunction, increased sympathetic activity, and impaired cerebral vasomotor response to carbon dioxide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-and-stroke/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Recurrent reductions of cerebral blood flow velocity then precipitate ischemic changes in patients with poor hemodynamic reserve (eg, intracranial arterial stenosis), particularly in border-zone areas and terminal artery territories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-and-stroke/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Permanent structural changes in the white matter of the hemispheres result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-and-stroke/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>OSA may exacerbate cerebrovascular abnormalities or other risk factors for stroke. Supporting this hypothesis, patients with OSA have an increased prevalence of systemic hypertension, heart disease, impaired vascular endothelial function, accelerated atherogenesis, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, prothrombotic coagulation shifts, proinflammatory states, and increased platelet aggregation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-and-stroke/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In patients with atrial fibrillation, OSA has been independently associated with recurrent atrial fibrillation after cardioversion or ablation as well as stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-and-stroke/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults#H1242522\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obstructive sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Atrial fibrillation'</a>.)</p><p>Patent foramen ovale (PFO) has also been suggested as a possible mechanism for increased stroke risk. Retrospective studies have found that patients with OSA are about twice as likely as controls to have evidence of a PFO by transcranial Doppler with agitated saline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-and-stroke/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. In patients with a PFO, nocturnal apneas and pulmonary hypertension associated with OSA could increase right-to-left shunting, thereby increasing the risk of paradoxical embolism and stroke.</p><p>The potential role of vibratory trauma on carotid endothelial function due to snoring is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=snoring-in-adults#H1837184456\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Snoring in adults&quot;, section on 'Potential consequences'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87368165\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE AFTER STROKE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both obstructive and central respiratory events (apneas and hypopneas) occur with increased frequency in patients with stroke compared with the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-and-stroke/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Similar to the general population, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is more common than central sleep apnea (CSA) in patients with stroke.</p><p>In a systematic review of 29 studies that included 2342 patients who had a stroke or transient ischemic attack, a sleep related breathing disorder was subsequently identified in 72, 63, and 38 percent of patients when defined as an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of &gt;5, &gt;10, and &gt;20 respiratory events per hour of analysis time, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-and-stroke/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Among the 17 studies that distinguished central from obstructive respiratory events, OSA was the most common type of sleep-related breathing disorder. Only 7 percent of patients had CSA or Cheyne-Stokes breathing as their predominant respiratory abnormality.</p><p>Sleep-related breathing disorders are often detectable within 24 hours after the stroke and tend to be more severe if the stroke began while the patient was asleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-and-stroke/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. They are particularly prominent among older male patients whose stroke was caused by diabetes and macroangiopathy and whose stroke began at night [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-and-stroke/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104241071\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRIBUTING FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some cases, sleep-disordered breathing is a direct consequence of central nervous system injury. A wide variety of central nervous system locations can manifest obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> central sleep apnea (CSA), and the type of sleep-disordered breathing is not helpful in localizing stroke:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vascular injury to the respiratory centers in the medulla (eg, lateral medullary syndrome) can cause OSA, CSA, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-and-stroke/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infratentorial lesions can cause OSA, CSA, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-and-stroke/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bilateral hemispheric lesions typically cause Cheyne-Stokes breathing.</p><p/><p>More commonly, patients have preexisting OSA or CSA, often undiagnosed. In such cases, the sleep-related breathing disorder may be exacerbated after stroke, particularly when level of consciousness is impaired by the stroke itself or sedating medications. The most important risk factors for OSA in the general population are advancing age, male gender, obesity, and craniofacial or upper airway soft tissue abnormalities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults#H760186\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>Limited data also suggest that hypoglossal nerve dysfunction is common in patients after acute stroke, although it is not clear whether this finding is a cause or consequence of sleep-disordered breathing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-and-stroke/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104240935\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the general population, the most common clinical features of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are daytime sleepiness and loud snoring. Additional symptoms include waking up gasping or choking, morning headaches, nocturia, moodiness or irritability, lack of concentration, and memory impairment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55633\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55633 \">table 1</a>). On physical examination, patients are often obese and may have evidence of a crowded oropharynx and increased neck circumference. Clinical features of central sleep apnea are similar, except that obesity is less likely to be present.

Even in a community-based population, however, screening questionnaires are of limited value in identifying patients with a high likelihood of sleep apnea.

In addition, moderate to severe apnea is associated with adverse rehabilitation outcomes in the post-stroke setting. Clinicians should therefore maintain a high state of awareness in post-stroke patients and at the very least review overnight oximetry during the first five days post stroke.</p><p>Nocturnal oxygen desaturations (&lt;90 percent oxygen saturation over &gt;five minutes of sleep time) are highly suggestive of moderate to severe sleep apnea. In addition, patients with one or more clinical features of sleep apnea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55633\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55633 \">table 1</a>), particularly those with established risk factors such as obesity, should undergo diagnostic testing. Sleep apnea is also highly prevalent in acute stroke patients with dysphagia or dysphonia, since the same dysfunctional oropharyngeal muscles involved in swallowing and phonation are involved in sleep inspiration.</p><p>Whether all patients with stroke should undergo diagnostic sleep testing is debated, however, and widespread testing would require significant resources. Decisions must be individualized and take into account patient preferences, expected ability to adhere to positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy, overall functional status, quality of life, and goals of care. Patients with normal overnight oximetry and no clinical signs of sleep apnea (eg, loud snoring, excessive daytime sleepiness, nocturnal restlessness) probably do not need formal sleep testing.</p><p>The 2014 American Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/American</span> Stroke Association guidelines for the prevention of stroke include a recommendation to consider screening for OSA with polysomnography as part of secondary stroke prevention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-and-stroke/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Canadian Stroke Best Practice Recommendations endorse screening for OSA in all patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack, and the American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guidelines include a recommendation that patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack and symptoms of OSA undergo polysomnography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-and-stroke/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104241392\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing and modality of diagnostic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sleep-related breathing disorders are often present on polysomnography within 24 hours after stroke, and in many cases the breathing disorder probably preceded the stroke.

If oxygen desaturations occur (&lt;90 percent oxygen saturation over &gt;5 minutes of sleep time), patients can be treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP), or supplemental oxygen while hospitalized.

The efficacy of other therapies (eg, oral appliances) in patients who have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) following a stroke has not been studied. The treatment of OSA and central sleep apnea (CSA) is reviewed in greater detail elsewhere.

In such patients, PAP therapy reduces the frequency of respiratory events and oxygen desaturation during sleep; improves sleepiness, quality of life, cognitive function, and hypertension; and decreases health care utilization and, possibly, mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-and-stroke/abstract/48-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-52</a>].

Trials of early continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy in the acute stroke setting have had mixed results:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a randomized trial of 55 patients with acute stroke, patients assigned to early auto-titrating CPAP therapy (median time from symptom onset to CPAP initiation, 39 hours) had greater improvement in stroke severity scores at one month compared with those who received usual care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-and-stroke/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Similar results were reported in a study of comparable size and design, but the benefit was only significant in patients with high levels of CPAP adherence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-and-stroke/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A trial that randomly assigned 140 older adults with an ischemic stroke and an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of &ge;20 events per hour (primarily obstructive events) to either auto-titrated CPAP or no CPAP three to six days after the stroke, found that CPAP increased the proportion of patients with neurological improvement after one month, although the improvements were no longer statistically significant after three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-and-stroke/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. At two years, the rate of recurrent stroke was similar in patients randomized to CPAP versus usual care (5 versus 4 percent). With longer follow-up, cardiovascular event-free survival was better in the CPAP group, although the event rate in both arms was small and there was no difference in overall mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-and-stroke/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several other smaller randomized trials have found no significant difference in short-term functional outcomes or rate of recurrent stroke when CPAP is administered in the post-stroke setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-and-stroke/abstract/55,57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,57,58</a>] as well as difficulties with tolerance and adherence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-and-stroke/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p/><p>Most of these trials measured short-term endpoints, and long-term follow-up data are lacking. One observational study of 96 patients with an ischemic stroke and an AHI of &ge;20 events per hour found lower mortality at five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-and-stroke/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>] and fewer nonfatal cardiovascular events at seven years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-and-stroke/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>] among patients who tolerated CPAP therapy than among those who did not.

Frequent reassessment is necessary for patients who receive a trial of PAP therapy, due to the theoretical potential for a reduction in blood pressure induced by PAP to impair cerebral perfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-and-stroke/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>] and worsen physical function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-and-stroke/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].

In one study in which 50 patients with acute stroke underwent polysomnography within 24 hours of stroke, sleep apnea (defined as an apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] &gt;10 events per hour) and hyperglycemia were independent predictors of early neurologic worsening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-and-stroke/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. A mechanism by which sleep-related breathing disorders may contribute to early neurologic worsening is called reversed Robin Hood syndrome (RRHS). Carbon dioxide-related vasodilation during intermittent exposure to hypercapnia increases blood flow velocity in unaffected vessels. This creates an intracranial steal phenomenon that decreases the blood flow velocity in the vessels that supply ischemic areas of the brain. In a prospective cohort study of 153 patients with acute ischemic stroke, 15 percent of patients had transcranial Doppler ultrasound abnormalities consistent with intracranial steal and 7 percent also had neurologic worsening consistent with RRHS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-and-stroke/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Longer-term outcomes may also be worse in patients with sleep-related breathing disorders, as demonstrated by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective cohort study evaluated 47 patients via overnight oximetry approximately 13 days after an ischemic stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-and-stroke/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. More frequent arterial oxyhemoglobin desaturation episodes and increased time spent with an arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation less than 90 percent were associated with both increased mortality at one year and a decreased Barthel index at discharge, three months, and 12 months. A low Barthel index indicates functional impairment and predicts increased length of stay and mortality. Polysomnography was performed on 19 of the patients, which demonstrated that more frequent arterial oxyhemoglobin desaturation episodes were associated with a higher AHI. Episodes of oxyhemoglobin desaturation were largely due to obstructive apneas.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective cohort study of 223 patients who were consecutively admitted for stroke, 166 survivors underwent polysomnography approximately two months after the stroke and were followed for seven years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-and-stroke/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Ninety-six patients had an AHI of &ge;20 events per hour and were offered auto-titrated continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. Patients who did not use CPAP for &gt;four hours on 70 percent of days had an increased risk for new ischemic stroke (27.9 percent) when compared with patients who had the same AHI but tolerated CPAP (14.3 percent), patients with an AHI of 10 to 19 events per hour (7.7 percent), and patients with an AHI of &le;9 events per hour (12.9 percent). This study had several limitations, including that it did not control for several potentially important confounders (eg, changes in cardiovascular risk factors and medication usage during the study).</p><p/><p>Increasing data also suggest that intermittent nocturnal hypoxia associated with clinically significant obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may increase the risk of vascular cognitive impairment and other forms of dementia, possibly by contributing to cerebral subcortical small vessel disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-and-stroke/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>OSA has been associated with an increased risk for stroke, independent of vascular risk factors. The risk of stroke in patients with other sleep-related breathing disorders, including CSA syndrome, is not well studied. (See <a href=\"#H104240889\" class=\"local\">'Sleep apnea as a risk factor for stroke'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep-related breathing disorders are common in patients with stroke, occurring in up to 70 percent of patients when defined by an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) &ge;5 events per hour. (See <a href=\"#H87368165\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence after stroke'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In some cases, sleep-related breathing disorders occur as a consequence of acute central nervous system injury; more commonly, patients have preexisting OSA or more rarely CSA, often undiagnosed. In such cases, the sleep-related breathing disorder may be exacerbated after stroke, particularly when level of consciousness is impaired by the stroke itself or sedating medications. (See <a href=\"#H104241071\" class=\"local\">'Contributing factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Typical clinical features of sleep-disordered breathing, such as daytime sleepiness and snoring, may be lacking in patients with stroke. Clinical features that have been associated with an increased risk for sleep-disordered breathing in patients with stroke include obesity, systolic hypertension, nocturnal oxygen desaturations, and increased stroke severity. (See <a href=\"#H104240935\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above and <a href=\"#H104241323\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnostic sleep testing is recommended in stroke patients with one or more clinical features of sleep-disordered breathing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55633\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55633 \">table 1</a>). Post-stroke patients with nocturnal desaturations, dysphagia, or dysphonia are particularly likely to have sleep apnea. Diagnostic testing can take the form of in-laboratory polysomnography or home sleep apnea testing. In addition, emerging data suggest that auto-titrating continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy may be useful as a treatment tool in stroke patients and feasible to initiate in the acute setting. (See <a href=\"#H104243560\" class=\"local\">'Screening in post-stroke patients'</a> above and <a href=\"#H104241392\" class=\"local\">'Timing and modality of diagnostic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy and behavioral modifications are the mainstays of treatment for patients diagnosed with sleep-related breathing disorders. In patients with acute stroke, treatment decisions must be tailored to the clinical status of the patient and their perceived ability to adhere to PAP therapy. The type of positive airway therapy is determined by the predominant type of sleep-disordered breathing. The efficacy of other therapies (eg, oral appliances) in patients who have OSA following a stroke has not been studied. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep-related breathing disorders are associated with early neurologic worsening after stroke and may also be associated with poorer long-term outcomes and increased risk for cognitive impairment and dementia among adults with and without cerebrovascular disease.
