Although the frequency is largely independent of the particular technique used for catheter insertion, peritoneoscopic placement may be associated with the fewest outflow complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninfectious-complications-of-peritoneal-dialysis-catheters/abstract/5-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-12</a>]. In one study, for example, only 10 outflow problems occurred among 136 peritoneoscopically placed catheters (8 percent) followed for 1183 patient-months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninfectious-complications-of-peritoneal-dialysis-catheters/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. One catheter had been placed in the preperitoneal space, and nine had migrated because of misalignment of the radiopaque stripe (a feature that guides placement and maintains a clear view of catheter orientation).</p><p>Another technique of catheter placement involves subcutaneous embedding of the peritoneal catheter for weeks to months in patients in whom the need for dialysis is not urgent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> maximal chances for healing are desired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninfectious-complications-of-peritoneal-dialysis-catheters/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Since the wound surrounding the catheter site is allowed to heal, subcutaneous embedding may lower the frequency of catheter-related problems. The incidence of drainage failure, as well as other possible complications, was evaluated in one study of 26 such catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninfectious-complications-of-peritoneal-dialysis-catheters/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Outflow failure occurred in five (20 percent). There was no correlation between omental obstruction and the duration of catheter embedding.

Outflow obstruction in association with pain suggests catheter abutment; these patients have been found to have catheters positioned near discrete abdominal sites, such as the subdiaphragm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninfectious-complications-of-peritoneal-dialysis-catheters/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Outflow failure usually occurs within the first month of catheter use, with the time of onset varying by cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninfectious-complications-of-peritoneal-dialysis-catheters/abstract/8,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kinking of the catheter, which may cause inflow and outflow problems, usually becomes obvious soon after catheter placement.

Recently implanted catheters have a radiopaque stripe, which permits radiographic visualization of the catheter tip; the tip should not migrate significantly over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninfectious-complications-of-peritoneal-dialysis-catheters/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since outflow failure is defined by the incomplete recovery of instilled fluid, it is important to exclude pericatheter or dialysate leakage as the underlying cause of the lost dialysate. The detection of dialysate leaking out of the abdominal cavity, whether internally or externally, is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Pericatheter leakage'</a> below.)</p><p>If leakage has been excluded, the etiology of outflow failure can be ascertained by the history, physical examination, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiography. As an example, a decrease in dialysate flow occurring days after catheter placement, in combination with a radiograph showing an abnormally placed catheter, strongly suggests that malpositioning is the underlying cause.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prevention is optimized by proper positioning of the catheter upon implantation and avoiding constipation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of outflow failure depends upon the cause of the obstruction.

Appropriate agents include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorbitol</a>, non-polyethylene glycol, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lactulose</a>, and other non-magnesium, non-phosphorus-containing stool <span class=\"nowrap\">softener/laxative</span> combinations. The resumption of bowel movements cures nearly one-half of all cases of outflow failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninfectious-complications-of-peritoneal-dialysis-catheters/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Fibrin clot</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although heparin (at a dose of 200 to 500 units per liter) is usually added when plugs or strands of fibrin are visible in the drained fluid, it is more beneficial when added prophylactically. Occlusions due to fibrin clot were traditionally managed with urokinase-induced lysis, a procedure in which urokinase (5000 units) was instilled into the catheter for one hour and then removed. The effectiveness of this procedure varied between individuals and with the size and viscosity of the clot. If successful, lysis was followed by the instillation of heparin in the dialysate for several exchanges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninfectious-complications-of-peritoneal-dialysis-catheters/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Given its effectiveness in occluded central venous dialysis catheters, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a> (recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator [tPA]), a recombinant protease specific for fibrin, has been utilized in clotted peritoneal dialysis catheters with some anecdotal success:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a>, fibrin clot dissolution was achieved in four peritoneal dialysis patients, with both inflow and outflow intracatheter obstruction refractory to saline flushes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninfectious-complications-of-peritoneal-dialysis-catheters/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Alteplase was instilled and allowed to dwell for an hour, after which relief of obstruction was obtained.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study, thrombolysis was effective in four of seven attempts after instillation and a one-hour dwell in catheters of six pediatric patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninfectious-complications-of-peritoneal-dialysis-catheters/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p>The dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a> will vary according to volume of the peritoneal dialysis catheter and its respective transfer set.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Malpositioned catheters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although malpositioned catheters frequently require replacement (particularly for long-term patency), they can sometimes be managed with fluoroscopy. Stiff wire manipulation can be performed by most interventional radiologists. With this technique, initial success with restoration of drain capability is observed in 55 to 80 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninfectious-complications-of-peritoneal-dialysis-catheters/abstract/19-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-24</a>]. However, long-term salvage is less reliable (33 percent) as repeated malpositioning is common. In addition, redirection can be performed surgically, including laparoscopically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninfectious-complications-of-peritoneal-dialysis-catheters/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Urgent-start peritoneal dialysis may be associated with catheter complications, often due to malposition, but the incidence is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninfectious-complications-of-peritoneal-dialysis-catheters/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urgent-start-peritoneal-dialysis#H287059667\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urgent-start peritoneal dialysis&quot;, section on 'Rapid catheter placement'</a>.)</p><p>It is not known whether the catheter design influences the risk of malposition. One randomized, controlled trial that compared coiled versus straight-end swan-neck catheters found no significant differences in catheter malposition or noninfectious complications. However, in this study and in an accompanying meta-analysis that included the results of this study, there was a trend for an increased risk of catheter-tip malposition with coiled-end catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninfectious-complications-of-peritoneal-dialysis-catheters/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Additional study of this is needed before a recommendation for a specific catheter can be made.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Catheter kinking</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Kinking usually requires catheter replacement. However, since kinking may be due to the placement of the two catheter cuffs too near each other, removal of the superficial cuff may cure outflow problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninfectious-complications-of-peritoneal-dialysis-catheters/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Abdominal exploration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If initial management attempts fail <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> additional catheter manipulation or replacement is required, traditional surgical or laparoscopic exploration may be useful since they allow direct visualization of the peritoneal cavity. These techniques permit the operator, if necessary, to perform the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Catheter redirection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Omentectomy or adhesiolysis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Catheter replacement</p><p/><p>An advantage of the less invasive surgical techniques is that catheter function can be tested immediately after an attempt at correction but prior to scope removal, thereby permitting additional corrective manipulations, if necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninfectious-complications-of-peritoneal-dialysis-catheters/abstract/30-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-34</a>]. The effectiveness of laparoscopic surgery to salvage dysfunctional catheters was evaluated in one study of 16 patients who underwent 19 laparoscopic procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninfectious-complications-of-peritoneal-dialysis-catheters/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Adhesions were the cause of obstruction in 12 cases, omental wrapping in 7, and both adhesions and omental wrapping in 1. All 19 salvage procedures were successful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">PERICATHETER LEAKAGE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Leakage of dialysate at the pericatheter site tends to occur early after catheter placement in association with high-dialysate volumes and in those with a weak abdominal wall (such as those with a history of multiple surgeries or pregnancies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninfectious-complications-of-peritoneal-dialysis-catheters/abstract/15,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,35,36</a>]. In addition, leaks frequently occur only after a patient becomes physically active on a standard ambulatory peritoneal dialysis regimen, a schedule in which dwells <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> exchanges occur in association with maximum intra-abdominal pressures. They are therefore less common in those who undergo dialysate exchanges when supine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reported incidence of pericatheter leak is widely variable (1 to 40 percent) due in part to varying outcomes with the three principal methods of catheter placement: surgical, peritoneoscopic, and percutaneous without peritoneoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninfectious-complications-of-peritoneal-dialysis-catheters/abstract/8-12,36-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12,36-40</a>]. In one study, a higher incidence of leak was associated with the percutaneous approach compared with conventional surgical placement (20 versus 9 percent), although this difference was not statistically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninfectious-complications-of-peritoneal-dialysis-catheters/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. By comparison, earlier studies reported higher incidences of leak with surgical placement (12 to 39 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninfectious-complications-of-peritoneal-dialysis-catheters/abstract/6,32,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,32,41,42</a>]. Leakage appears to be less likely with peritoneoscopically placed catheters and presternal catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninfectious-complications-of-peritoneal-dialysis-catheters/abstract/30,43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,43-45</a>]. Subcutaneous embedding of the implanted peritoneal catheter may be associated with a very low incidence of pericatheter leakage. In one study, 26 catheters were embedded subcutaneously for 28 to 675 days, and 21 were ultimately activated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninfectious-complications-of-peritoneal-dialysis-catheters/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. No leaks occurred.</p><p>The incidence of leakage for subcutaneous, embedded catheters may be associated with the length of time the catheters are buried. One report found that no catheter buried for four or more weeks leaked, while 16 percent of catheters activated less than four weeks after placement leaked, as did 14 percent of conventionally placed catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninfectious-complications-of-peritoneal-dialysis-catheters/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Overall, it is not clear that one type of catheter is superior to another with regard to the potential for leakage; however, the double-cuff catheter is generally considered least likely to be associated with leak.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pericatheter leakage is recognized by the presence of fluid in the area surrounding the catheter. However, the initial manifestations of pericatheter leakage may be subtle. Subcutaneous swelling, which may be overlooked, and diminished outflow volumes may precede frank leakage. Genital and abdominal wall edema may also indicate the presence of a subcutaneous leak. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-hernias-in-continuous-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal hernias in continuous peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of fluid around a peritoneal catheter may be due to leakage of dialysate or to serosanguineous fluid extruding from the subcutaneous tissue. If the etiology of the fluid is unclear, a dialysate leak can be confirmed by checking the glucose concentration of the leaking fluid. Dextrostix testing will yield an extremely high glucose concentration if the fluid is dialysate. By comparison, serosanguineous fluid leaking from subcutaneous tissue will not be strongly positive for glucose.</p><p>To help confirm the diagnosis and delineate the anatomy of the leak, peritoneal scintigraphy or, in particular, computed tomography (CT) scanning after infusion of dialysate containing contrast material can be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninfectious-complications-of-peritoneal-dialysis-catheters/abstract/36,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,47</a>]. In one retrospective study, one-third of leaks occurring late after catheter placement required imaging for diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninfectious-complications-of-peritoneal-dialysis-catheters/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Successful management of pericatheter leaks can usually be accomplished by decreasing exertional activity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the dialysate volume. Occasionally, converting the patient to continuous peritoneal modalities, in which exchanges occur when supine, or to temporary hemodialysis may resolve dialysate leakage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninfectious-complications-of-peritoneal-dialysis-catheters/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Leaks that do not respond to conservative management may require minor surgical repair of the deep cuff or, rarely, catheter replacement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">CATHETER CUFF EXTRUSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Erosion of the catheter cuff through the skin to the outer abdominal wall may be a sequela of exit-site infection or excessive superficial cuff placement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peritoneal-catheter-exit-site-and-tunnel-infections-in-peritoneal-dialysis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peritoneal catheter exit-site and tunnel infections in peritoneal dialysis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of cuff extrusion ranges from 3.5 to 17 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninfectious-complications-of-peritoneal-dialysis-catheters/abstract/16,32,41,42,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,32,41,42,46</a>]. Neither the method of catheter placement, surgical or percutaneous, nor the specific catheter used influences the likelihood of extrusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninfectious-complications-of-peritoneal-dialysis-catheters/abstract/16,32,41,46,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,32,41,46,50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The need for cuff shaving or catheter removal depends in part upon the presence or absence of infection. More conservative measures may be attempted in those without evidence of an infectious process. An eroding, extruding cuff may require removal by opening the subcutaneous tissue surrounding the exit site and trimming or removing the cuff under sterile conditions and local anesthesia. Poor healing of the area or signs of persistent inflammation or infection are indications for catheter removal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peritoneal-catheter-exit-site-and-tunnel-infections-in-peritoneal-dialysis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peritoneal catheter exit-site and tunnel infections in peritoneal dialysis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">INTESTINAL PERFORATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intestinal perforation can occur at the time of catheter implantation because of direct injury or weeks to months after placement because of bowel erosion.

Based on these observations, preventive measures should include holding anticoagulation therapy for a minimum of 24 hours after the procedure and obtaining and (if necessary) correcting coagulation parameters prior to surgery.</p><p>Unless the effluent hematocrit is greater than 2 percent, conservative management with ongoing observation is safe and effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninfectious-complications-of-peritoneal-dialysis-catheters/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In this setting, heparinization of the dialysate can be used to prevent catheter occlusion.</p><p>Hemoperitoneum not temporally related to catheter placement can also occur and is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninfectious-complications-of-continuous-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninfectious complications of continuous peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bloody-peritoneal-dialysate-hemoperitoneum\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bloody peritoneal dialysate (hemoperitoneum)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h1\">ABDOMINAL SURGERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Major abdominal surgery that is unrelated to the catheter is sometimes required in patients with an indwelling peritoneal dialysis catheter. In this setting, surgery may be complicated by the presence of dense intra-abdominal adhesions (due in part to repeated peritonitis episodes) and the presence of the catheter in the upper or lower abdomen or pelvis.</p><p>Given that many patients have minimal adhesions, the presence of an intraperitoneal catheter is not a contraindication to laparoscopy; the surgeon should be prudent and employ an open insertion of the trocar. With planned open procedures, the possible need for extensive adhesiolysis should be anticipated.</p><p>The abdominal incision should not be near the catheter insertion site. In addition, the catheter should be identified to ensure that it is not displaced during packing or manipulation of abdominal contents.</p><p>At completion of surgery, the catheter is checked to ensure it has not been dislodged; care should also be taken in closing the abdomen to avoid trapping the catheter in sutures.</p><p>Hemodialysis may be required in the immediate postoperative period, depending upon the patient's clinical status, degree of residual renal function, and ability to perform supine only, low-volume peritoneal dialysis exchanges. If interim hemodialysis is required, resumption of peritoneal dialysis after a week delay is reasonable, although the time on hemodialysis, time on low-volume supine peritoneal dialysis, or time without dialysis is variable based upon patient characteristics and the clinical situation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials.

These include outflow failure, pericatheter leak, abdominal wall herniation, catheter-cuff excursion, and intestinal perforation. Some of these complications can be managed conservatively, while others require laparoscopic, peritoneoscopic, or traditional surgical intervention. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Outflow failure is commonly caused by constipation or obstipation. Radiography is useful for elucidating the cause of outflow failure, especially if related to constipation or catheter malposition. It is important to exclude pericatheter or dialysate leakage as the underlying cause of incomplete recovery of instilled dialysate. Once leakage has been excluded, the underlying cause of outflow failure is usually ascertained by history, physical exam, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiography. Prevention is optimized by proper positioning of the catheter upon implantation and avoidance of constipation. Treatment of outflow failure depends on the cause of obstruction. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Outflow failure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pericatheter leakage tends to occur early after catheter placement in association with high-dialysate volumes and in those with weak abdominal walls. The incidence is widely variable and may relate to the practice of subcutaneous embedding of the implanted catheter upon implantation. Pericatheter leakage is recognized by the presence of fluid surrounding the catheter and may be initially subtle. Subcutaneous swelling and diminished outflow volumes may precede frank leakage. The diagnosis of pericatheter leakage may be made by a high glucose concentration of the leaking fluid. Confirmatory diagnosis and delineation of the anatomy of the leak may be demonstrated more definitively by computed tomography (CT) scanning. Management is usually accomplished successfully by decreasing either dialysate volume <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> exertional activity. Temporary transfer to continuous peritoneal dialysis or temporary hemodialysis may be necessary in some patients. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Pericatheter leakage'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Erosion of the catheter cuff through the skin may be a sequela of exit-site infection or excessive superficial cuff placement. Conservative measures may be attempted in those without evidence of an infectious process. Cuff shaving or catheter removal may be required in the presence of infection. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Catheter cuff extrusion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intestinal perforation can occur at the time of catheter implantation because of direct injury or weeks to months after placement because of bowel erosion. This complication can be life threatening and therefore requires a high index of suspicion and urgent attention. Clues to the presence of perforation are feculent or bloody dialysate, dialysate retention, diarrhea occurring after dialysate instillation, or gram-negative peritonitis. Therapy consists of the cessation of peritoneal dialysis treatments, catheter removal, intravenous antibiotics, and bowel repair. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Intestinal perforation'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninfectious-complications-of-peritoneal-dialysis-catheters/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Holley JL, Praino BM.
