In general, psychotherapy focuses primarily upon eating disorder cognitions and behaviors, and secondarily addresses affective issues, relationships, and underlying issues that may have initiated the eating disorder. In addition, clinicians with expertise in eating disorders can also provide pharmacotherapy. Psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy for anorexia and bulimia nervosa are discussed elsewhere in this topic. (See <a href=\"#H251810\" class=\"local\">'Anorexia nervosa'</a> below and <a href=\"#H251818\" class=\"local\">'Bulimia nervosa'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H251707\"><span class=\"h3\">Registered dietitian</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dietary and nutritional support staff direct nutritional rehabilitation, discuss available dietary options and meal plan requirements with patients, and provide nutritional education regarding changes in eating behaviors.

In addition, the clinician assesses patients for medical complications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F67080\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67080 \">table 1</a>), and monitors immediate medical issues (eg, vital sign stability, electrolyte abnormalities, and hydration status) as well as longer term issues (eg, bone density, menstruation, and growth issues in younger patients).

Treatment options (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F73092\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73092 \">table 3</a>) usually include inpatient hospitalization, partial hospital (day program), and outpatient care; in addition, residential care may be available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eating-disorders-overview-of-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Clinical judgment and some degree of individuation is required. The choice is based upon the severity of illness as well as underlying or concurrent general medical and psychiatric disorders. As an example, patients with eating disorders may have serious medical complications and are at increased risk for suicide or non-suicidal self-injurious behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eating-disorders-overview-of-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], and may thus require psychiatric hospitalization or day treatment programs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1312601377\"><span class=\"h2\">Reducing stigma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The stigma of eating disorders may be associated with dysfunctional thoughts that may perhaps interfere with treatment. Education of patients that includes biological explanations may possibly mitigate stigma. Indirect evidence for incorporating biological explanations as part of psychoeducation includes a meta-analysis of four studies in 542 undergraduate students, which compared the efficacy of biological explanations with sociocultural explanations in reducing the stigma of eating disorders; three of the studies were randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eating-disorders-overview-of-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Reduction of stigma was superior with biological explanations, and the clinical advantage was moderate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2874027108\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Educational programs may possibly prevent eating disorders.

In addition, the effectiveness of prevention programs was greater for the following types of interventions and participants:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Selected</strong> programs that targeted high-risk participants (eg, dissatisfaction with body shape or weight), in contrast to universal programs that were offered to all available participants</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Interactive</strong> programs that included exercises focusing upon risk factors (eg, body dissatisfaction) for onset of eating disorder psychopathology, in contrast to didactic (psychoeducational) programs</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Multisession</strong> programs, in contrast to single session interventions</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Females</strong> rather than males</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Age &ge;15 years</strong> rather than younger participants</p><p/><p>Many prevention programs are conducted in schools.

In addition, residential care may be available. </p><p>One of the primary factors in deciding upon level of care is severity of weight loss and malnutrition. Although body mass index (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-body-mass-index-bmi-quetelets-index-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) is often used to measure weight loss and to determine weight goals, other metrics may be used, especially for young adults (eg, age 18 to 21 years). Alternative measures of weight loss and weight goals include ideal body weight, expected body weight, and median body weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eating-disorders-overview-of-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H251834\"><span class=\"h3\">Nutritional rehabilitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with anorexia nervosa who are underweight, we suggest nutritional rehabilitation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-nutritional-rehabilitation-nutritional-support\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anorexia nervosa in adults and adolescents: Nutritional rehabilitation (nutritional support)&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Patients with anorexia nervosa frequently resist refeeding and may require inpatient treatment to promote weight gain. (See <a href=\"#H75408311\" class=\"local\">'Treatment setting'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H252082\"><span class=\"h4\">Refeeding syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although weight gain is the cornerstone of treatment for patients with anorexia nervosa, restoring weight by refeeding patients too rapidly <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> aggressively can lead to the refeeding syndrome, which is potentially fatal. The refeeding syndrome is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-the-refeeding-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anorexia nervosa in adults and adolescents: The refeeding syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H251954\"><span class=\"h3\">Psychotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Standard treatment of anorexia nervosa includes psychotherapy. Although several therapies have been adapted or developed to treat the disorder, there is no compelling evidence that one therapy is clearly superior to the others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eating-disorders-overview-of-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. Thus, the choice is based upon availability, patient age, patient preference, and cost. The options include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</strong> &ndash; CBT encourages patients to change the dysfunctional cognitions (thoughts and beliefs about body weight and shape) and behavioral disturbances (eg, excessive food restriction) that perpetuate anorexia nervosa, and places less emphasis upon the factors that caused the disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eating-disorders-overview-of-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The efficacy and administration of CBT for anorexia nervosa are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-cbt\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anorexia nervosa in adults: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Psychodynamic psychotherapy</strong> &ndash; Time-limited psychodynamic psychotherapy addresses conscious and unconscious meanings of eating disorder symptoms, the effects of symptoms upon current relationships and the patient&rsquo;s relationship with the therapist, and does not advise patients about eating behaviors. Evidence supporting the use of psychodynamic psychotherapy includes a one-year randomized trial in 40 patients that compared psychodynamic psychotherapy (weekly sessions lasting 50 minutes, for one year) with usual treatment that included psychoeducation, encouraging patients to adopt a healthy diet, and monitoring patient weight (monthly sessions lasting 30 minutes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eating-disorders-overview-of-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/9,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12</a>]. Improvement (body weight &gt;85 percent of that expected for age and height) occurred in more patients who received active treatment than usual treatment (33 versus 5 percent). Additional information about psychodynamic psychotherapy is discussed separately in the context of depression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-psychodynamic-psychotherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Psychodynamic psychotherapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Specialist supportive clinical management</strong> &ndash; This therapy combines features of clinical management and supportive psychotherapy to address the core symptoms of anorexia nervosa (including low body weight, restrictive eating, and inappropriate compensatory behaviors) by providing education and advice about the illness, eating, and weight; facilitating normal eating and weight gain; praising the patient&rsquo;s progress; and exploring other life issues identified by patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eating-disorders-overview-of-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/11,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13-15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Motivational interviewing</strong> &ndash; Motivational interviewing is used to motivate patients with anorexia nervosa to gain weight by eliciting both their reasons to do so, and their ambivalence about change [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eating-disorders-overview-of-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The sessions explore how the illness affects the patient&rsquo;s life, the pros and cons of the disorder, the value and meaning of anorexia nervosa in the patient&rsquo;s life, the patient&rsquo;s goals, and the discrepancy between the patient&rsquo;s current state of functioning and desired future state. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Family therapy</strong> &ndash; Family therapy can benefit adolescents with anorexia nervosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eating-disorders-overview-of-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. One type of family therapy is called family-based treatment (also called the Maudsley method), which is used for adolescents and focuses upon weight gain; the treatment initially places parents in charge of making decisions about appropriate eating and related behaviors, with the support of a family therapist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eating-disorders-overview-of-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/8,19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,19-21</a>]. As patients begin to improve, control over eating is gradually transferred back to them, and other issues related to family functioning are addressed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Another type of family therapy for adolescents with anorexia nervosa is called parent-focused treatment, in which a therapist meets with only the parents while a nurse meets with the patient for monitoring. The benefits of family-based treatment and parent-focused treatment appear to be comparable. One open-label randomized trial (n = 107 patients and their families) compared the two treatments, which each consisted of 18 sessions administered over six months; although remission at the end of treatment was greater with parent-focused treatment than family-based treatment (43 versus 22 percent of patients), follow-up assessments at 6 and 12 months posttreatment each found that remission was comparable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eating-disorders-overview-of-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Another reasonable alternative is systemic family therapy, which focuses upon general family functioning and processes. An open-label, nine-month randomized trial (n = 158 adolescents and their families) compared family-based treatment with systemic family therapy and found that weight gain during the first eight weeks was faster with family-based treatment than systemic family therapy, and that the median number of days of hospitalization required during the study was less with family-based treatment than systemic family therapy (8 versus 21) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eating-disorders-overview-of-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, one year after the end of treatment, remission was comparable for the two groups (approximately 40 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cognitive remediation therapy</strong> &ndash; Cognitive remediation therapy addresses cognitive processes (thinking styles) rather than the thought content and eating disorder core features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eating-disorders-overview-of-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Specific cognitive processes that are targeted include rigidity, which can manifest with strict attention to detail, perfectionistic tendencies, and all or nothing (black and white) thinking. The therapy also targets difficulties with shifting set, which is the ability to move back and forth between different concepts. Cognitive exercises are employed to improve cognitive flexibility and the ability to switch between concepts. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H323436\"><span class=\"h3\">Pharmacotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pharmacotherapy is not an initial or primary treatment for anorexia nervosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eating-disorders-overview-of-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/1,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,25</a>]. However, adjunctive pharmacotherapy is indicated for acutely ill patients who do not gain weight despite initial treatment with nutritional rehabilitation and psychotherapy. The use of medications to treat anorexia nervosa is discussed separately.

The intervention uses an alternating current passed through a metal coil placed against the scalp to generate a magnetic field, which induces an electric current that depolarizes neurons in a focal area of the surface cortex. A randomized trial compared one session of TMS with sham stimulation applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in patients with anorexia nervosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eating-disorders-overview-of-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The completer analysis (n = 49 female patients) of a composite measure of symptoms found a trend for greater improvement with TMS than sham treatment at 24 hours posttreatment. &#160; </p><p>Additional information about transcranial magnetic stimulation is discussed in the context of unipolar major depression.

However, two patients had their devices deactivated or removed for unclear reasons, five patients had incision-site pain, two patients had a seizure, one patient had a surgical-sited infection that ultimately required device explantation with subsequent reimplantation, one patient had an air embolus, and one patient had an intraoperative panic attack. &#160; &#160; </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a third prospective observational study (mean length of follow-up 38 months), four severely ill female adolescents with anorexia nervosa that was refractory to multiple courses of pharmacotherapy (mean duration of illness 19 months) received bilateral deep brain stimulation of the nucleus accumbens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eating-disorders-overview-of-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].
