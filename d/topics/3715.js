The variability in the reported incidence of AKI is likely related to differences in the severity of underlying rhabdomyolysis and varying definitions of AKI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-heme-pigment-induced-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>As an example, in one retrospective series of 148 patients in which rhabdomyolysis was defined as creatine kinase (CK) &gt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L,</span> 29 percent developed serum creatinine elevations &gt;2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (177 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-heme-pigment-induced-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In other reports, more severe rhabdomyolysis characterized by much higher CK levels, as may be seen following earthquakes, led to AKI requiring dialysis in 50 to 65 percent.

As a result, hemoglobinuria requires a relatively high plasma hemoglobin concentration.</p><p>Myoglobin, in comparison, is a smaller molecule (mol wt 17,000) and is not protein bound. As a result, myoglobin is rapidly filtered and excreted, and plasma retains its normal color unless renal failure limits myoglobin excretion.</p><p>In the setting of normal kidney function, the concentration of myoglobin necessary to visibly color plasma (approximately 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> would likely require a fatal degree of rhabdomyolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-heme-pigment-induced-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Patients with rhabdomyolysis typically present with the triad of pigmented granular casts in the urine, a red to brown color of the urine supernatant, and a marked elevation in the plasma creatine kinase (CK) level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-heme-pigment-induced-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/31,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,36</a>].

Myoglobin has a shorter half-life (three hours) than CK and is normally cleared from the plasma by hepatic metabolism to bilirubin and, to a lesser extent, by glomerular filtration and renal metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-heme-pigment-induced-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

Mild secondary hyperparathyroidism in the setting of renal dysfunction, correction of hyperphosphatemia (resulting from the rise in GFR), and an unexplained increase in calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) may contribute to this response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-heme-pigment-induced-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/52-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-55</a>].

More minor elevations are relatively common and often asymptomatic. However, the interpretation of the CK level must take into account the interval from time of injury to presentation as levels quickly decline from their peak value. CK levels may also be lower in patients with liver disease or multiorgan failure, possibly due to decreased half-life of the enzyme in the circulation as a result of extracellular glutathione depletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-heme-pigment-induced-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>Although an elevated myoglobin level is also diagnostic of rhabdomyolysis, this test is only mildly to moderately sensitive.
