It differs from food allergies (including wheat allergy), which are mediated by immunoglobulin E (IgE) or immunoglobulin G (IgG). The disorder is common, occurring in 0.5 to 1 percent of the general population in most countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The grains that contain the triggering proteins are wheat, barley, and rye. Previously, oats were thought to be harmful but this appears to be from contamination with wheat flour, and most people with celiac disease can tolerate pure oats once they have commenced a gluten-free diet. The small intestinal mucosa improves morphologically when treated with a gluten-free diet and relapses when gluten is reintroduced. In a study from an era in which celiac disease was not treated, mortality was 12 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The appropriate treatment is a gluten-free diet for life, which results in complete resolution of symptoms for most individuals.</p><p>The epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations of celiac disease are reviewed here. Other aspects of celiac disease in children are discussed in the following topic reviews:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of celiac disease in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-celiac-disease-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of celiac disease in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H208210137\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H208210144\"><span class=\"h2\">General population</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Celiac disease occurs primarily in Caucasians. In Europe and the United States, prevalence estimates range from 1:80 to 1:300 children (3 to 13 per 1000 children) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Females are affected approximately twice as often as males, although the ratio varies depending on the strategy used to find cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Prevalence estimates have increased with the advent of highly sensitive and specific screening tests, which identified many patients with minimal or no symptoms. Epidemiological studies using these tests with biopsy verification established prevalences of 1:300 to 1:500 in most countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. A large screening study in the United States suggested a prevalence of 1:133 among patients with no risk factors or symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. These estimates are similar to those found in European studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>].</p><p>One of the largest screening investigations of celiac disease was performed in 17,201 Italian school children, aged 6 to 15 years, who were recruited from several regions and represented 69 percent of the eligible population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The prevalence was 1:184 and the ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic cases was a remarkable 7:1 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F57975\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57975 \">table 1</a>). Based upon these data, it was estimated that the number of affected persons in Italy alone was 220,000, three-quarters of whom were unidentified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Even those not ethnically derived from European populations can develop celiac disease if they have an appropriate genetic background. Punjabis from India living in England and eating a gluten-rich diet developed this disorder 2.9 times more often than Europeans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A disorder named &quot;summer diarrhea&quot; had long been known in their indigenous country, when wheat replaced maize during the summer season. Furthermore, a very high prevalence rate of 5 percent was documented for the Saharawi population of Northern Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. It is also common in Egypt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], Tunisia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], Saudi Arabia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], and other populations in North Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Celiac disease appears to be uncommon in China, but a few cases have now been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The prevalence in some developing countries is probably underestimated due to limited access to diagnostic testing and confounded by other diarrheal diseases with small intestinal injury. Overall, the global distribution of the disease seems to parallel the distribution of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes that predispose to celiac disease, provided that the population is also exposed to gluten [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>These findings indicate that the number of so-called &quot;silent celiacs&quot; (a misnomer because most of these patients suffer from nonspecific symptoms) is much higher than the number of patients with classic celiac disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H208210423\"><span class=\"h2\">High-risk groups</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of celiac disease as detected by screening programs using specific antibodies is substantially increased in the following groups as compared with the general population (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50751\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50751 \">table 2</a>). Because of the increased risk, we suggest routine screening for celiac disease in pediatric patients with these conditions, although this approach is somewhat controversial (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children#H477994579\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of celiac disease in children&quot;, section on 'High-risk groups'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First- and second-degree relatives of patients with celiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>] </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Down syndrome </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 1 diabetes </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Selective immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autoimmune thyroiditis </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Turner syndrome </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Williams syndrome </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Juvenile chronic arthritis</p><p/><p>For these groups, the risk of celiac disease is approximately 3- to 10-fold higher than in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/1,5,7,21-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,7,21-25</a>].

The prevalence varies with the relationship to the proband. In a meta-analysis, the pooled prevalence of celiac disease was 8.9 percent (1:11) for siblings of the proband; 7.9 percent (1:13) for offspring of the proband; and 3 percent (1:33) for parents of the proband [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Pooled prevalence estimates for celiac disease are 1:13 (7.6 percent); approximately fivefold increase in risk over the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The mechanism for this association is unclear, although it is consistent with the propensity for other autoimmune diseases among individuals with Down syndrome.

In several reports, between 2.6 and 7.8 percent of adults with type 1 diabetes had IgA autoantibodies to endomysium or to tissue transglutaminase (tTG); most such patients were proven to have celiac disease with small bowel biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/26,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,35,36</a>]. Many such patients had no overt clinical manifestations of celiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Other reports have demonstrated that as many as 3.5 percent of children of parents with type 1 diabetes have celiac disease, the prevalence of which increases with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Of note, celiac disease and type 1 diabetes share HLA susceptibility alleles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], but the co-occurrence of the disorders is not fully explained by shared genetic risk loci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p>A causal relationship between celiac disease and diabetes mellitus has been suggested, but not established. A few studies in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>] and animals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>] suggest that celiac disease may trigger autoimmune processes leading to diabetes. One study noted that the prevalence of autoimmune diseases, including Type 1 diabetes mellitus, may be related to the duration of exposure to gluten, and may reach more than 30 percent in patients diagnosed with celiac disease after age 20 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. However, other observations suggest that celiac disease does not trigger diabetes, since the age of onset and the severity of diabetes do not appear to be influenced by the presence of celiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], and celiac autoantibodies usually develop after the onset of diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/34,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,41</a>]. Thus, larger and prospective clinical studies are required to clarify the relationship between celiac disease, type 1 diabetes, and other autoimmune disorders.</p><p>Whether a gluten-free diet improves diabetes in diabetic patients with celiac disease is unclear. Only a few small studies have investigated the effect of a strict gluten-free diet on type 1 diabetics with silent celiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>]. Patients showed at best a trend toward an increased body mass index (BMI) and bone health, but no change in folate or hemoglobin levels or insulin requirements.

Because most specific serologic tests for celiac disease are IgA antibodies, patients with known IgA deficiency require special strategies when screening for celiac disease. In addition, the possibility of undiagnosed IgA deficiency should be considered when interpreting the results of serologic screens. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children#H477995258\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of celiac disease in children&quot;, section on 'Special populations'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H477984966\"><span class=\"h3\">Autoimmune thyroiditis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>About 2 to 7 percent of individuals with autoimmune thyroiditis develop celiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/26,46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,46-48</a>]. The association is weak during childhood and appears to increase with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Conversely, 10 to 20 percent of individuals with celiac disease have autoimmune thyroiditis, and its clinical course does not appear to be affected by a gluten-free diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

In a series of 135 children with celiac disease, 23 percent had positive antithyroid antibody titers at diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Approximately 12 percent of the patients had elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, suggesting subclinical hypothyroidism, regardless of whether the antithyroid antibody titers were positive. In most of these patients, the subclinical hypothyroidism normalized during the follow-up period (8.9 &plusmn; 4 years on a gluten-free diet). Among patients with persistently positive antithyroid antibodies during the follow-up period, subclinical hypothyroidism developed in 25 percent. Thus, this study does not suggest that treatment with a gluten-free diet alters the clinical course of autoimmune thyroiditis in patients with celiac disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H477985038\"><span class=\"h3\">Other associations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of celiac disease is also increased in Turner syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/1,24,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,24,51</a>].

This observation was corroborated when the symptoms of his patients improved once bread was replaced by non-cereal-containing foods during periods of food shortage in the Second World War. This finding confirmed the benefit of earlier, empirical diets that used pure fruit, potatoes, banana, milk, or meat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-56</a>].</p><p>Because symptoms reoccurred when bread was reintroduced after the war, Dicke and van de Kamer initiated controlled experiments exposing children with celiac disease to defined diets and then determined fecal weight and fecal fat as a measure of malabsorption.

Shortly thereafter, the toxic agents were found to be present in gluten, the primary protein found in wheat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>The celiac lesion in the proximal small intestine was first described in 1954.

(See <a href=\"#H208210423\" class=\"local\">'High-risk groups'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations of celiac disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Genetic factors'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Autoimmunity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Celiac disease is associated with a number of autoimmune disorders, including type 1 diabetes mellitus and autoimmune thyroid disease. In addition, the intestinal lesion of celiac disease is associated with several different autoantibodies that are useful for diagnostic purposes. Immunoglobulin A (IgA)-antibodies against endomysium and the endomysial autoantigen tissue transglutaminase (tTG) are highly sensitive and specific. (See <a href=\"#H208210423\" class=\"local\">'High-risk groups'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children#H477986532\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of celiac disease in children&quot;, section on 'Antibody testing'</a>.)</p><p>It is possible that immunologic similarities between gliadin protein motifs and enteral pathogens may be involved in pathogenesis of an immunologic response to antigens in gluten. This hypothesis was supported in one study, in which analysis of alpha gliadin demonstrated an amino acid region that was homologous to the 54KDa E1b protein coat of adenovirus 12, suggesting that exposure to the virus in a susceptible person could be involved in the pathogenesis of celiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-adenovirus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations of adenovirus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, the pathogenic role of these antibodies remains to be clarified. Both humoral and cell-mediated immune mechanisms are involved, and the range of gluten peptides triggering the reaction may vary with the age of the patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations of celiac disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Autoantibodies and intraepithelial lymphocytes'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Infant feeding practices</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breastfeeding and gluten exposure &ndash; The pathogenesis of celiac disease at any age requires exposure to gluten. The possibility that the timing and manner of gluten exposure affects the risk for clinical expression of celiac disease has been raised by observational studies, but this hypothesis has not been confirmed in randomized trials. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Two randomized trials reported no association between that timing of gluten introduction or breastfeeding and celiac disease risk. One study included 944 infants in eight European countries who were at high risk for celiac disease because of their genetic profile (HLD-DQ-2 or DQ-8 positive and at least one first-degree relative with celiac disease). They were randomized to receive a small amount of gluten daily from 16 to 24 weeks of age and were compared with infants given placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. There was no difference in celiac disease prevalence at three years of age, and the prevalence did not vary with exposure to breastfeeding. A second study included 832 infants from Italy with a similarly high risk for celiac disease, who were randomized to dietary introduction of gluten at six months of age versus 12 months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Early introduction of gluten was associated with higher risk for celiac autoimmunity and overt celiac disease at two years of age, but there was no difference between the groups by five years of age and no association with breastfeeding. Thus, later introduction of gluten did not alter overall celiac disease risk, although it modestly delayed the onset of celiac disease. A remaining question is whether the <strong>amount</strong> of gluten exposure during the first two years of life, particularly in late infancy, is associated with an increased risk for celiac disease. In observational follow-up of the cohort described above, the amount of gluten consumed between 11 and 36 months of age did not influence the risk of developing celiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>], contrasting with findings from a previous study that found at least a twofold increase in risk for children with higher gluten exposure up to two years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Prior to the findings from these randomized trials, it was common practice to recommend gradual introduction of gluten into an infant's diet between four and six months of age, ideally while breastfeeding, because both factors were thought to reduce celiac disease risk. This hypothesis was based on several epidemiologic studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/70-73\" class=\"abstract_t\">70-73</a>]. In particular, these factors were thought to be implicated in an epidemic of celiac disease that occurred in Sweden between 1984 and 1996, in which the frequency of symptomatic celiac disease in children younger than two years increased fourfold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. The onset and end of this epidemic were abrupt and coincided with specific changes in infant feeding practices that suggested the possibility of a causal association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Because the randomized trials cited above provide evidence that the timing of gluten introduction and breastfeeding does not affect celiac disease risk, the reasons for the onset and resolution of this Swedish epidemic remain unclear. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although celiac disease prevalence in Sweden has returned to pre-epidemic levels, Swedish children remain at increased risk for celiac disease as compared with children in most other countries. This was suggested by the study cited above, in which children with the same HLA genotype had increased risk if they were raised in Sweden as compared with the United States, Finland, or Germany [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. A position paper from the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition recommends introduction of gluten any time between 4 and 12 months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,77</a>]. The panel also suggested against rapid introduction of large amounts of gluten, although this was not precisely defined. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=introducing-solid-foods-and-vitamin-and-mineral-supplementation-during-infancy#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Introducing solid foods and vitamin and mineral supplementation during infancy&quot;, section on 'What to feed and how to advance'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cow's milk protein &ndash; Avoidance of cow's milk protein during the weaning period does not appear to reduce the risk for celiac disease autoimmunity or celiac disease. This was shown in a randomized trial of 230 infants who were considered at risk for celiac disease because of their HLA type and at least one family member having type 1 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Infants weaned to an extensively hydrolyzed formula did not have decreased risk for tTG positivity or celiac disease compared with those weaned to cow milk-based formula, with up to 10 years follow-up. Individuals who developed celiac disease had increased titers of cow milk antibodies prior to elevation of tTG antibodies or diagnosis of celiac disease, but there was no evidence that this was causal. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For many years, celiac disease was defined by a set of classic clinical manifestations. However, the combination of serologic, genetic, and histologic data has led to an appreciation of the highly variable clinical manifestations of the condition and the description of other categories of celiac disease. Celiac disease can be categorized as classic, non-gastrointestinal, <span class=\"nowrap\">silent/subclinical,</span> or potential, depending on the clinical phenotype (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F95864\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95864 \">table 4</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Classic celiac disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classic description of celiac disease, or gluten-sensitive enteropathy, includes the following three features:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms of malabsorption such as steatorrhea, weight loss, or other signs of nutrient or vitamin deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of characteristic histologic changes (including villous atrophy) on small intestinal biopsy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resolution of the mucosal lesions and symptoms upon withdrawal of gluten-containing foods, usually within a few weeks to months.</p><p/><p>Interpretation of the intestinal biopsy is discussed separately.

However, in rare cases, diet-refractory celiac disease may be related to sprue-associated lymphoma or to collagenous sprue, a related but little-understood disorder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of celiac disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Refractory sprue'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Non-gastrointestinal celiac disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some patients with celiac disease, non-gastrointestinal (also known as extraintestinal) manifestations are predominant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76474\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76474 \">table 5A</a>), with few or no gastrointestinal symptoms. In the past this was termed &quot;atypical&quot; celiac disease because it was thought to be uncommon, but the advent of serologic screening for celiac disease has identified a substantial proportion of patients with this symptom profile. As for patients with classical disease, the diagnosis requires serologic testing, biopsy evidence of villous atrophy, and improvement of symptoms on a gluten-free diet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F95864\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95864 \">table 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Silent/subclinical celiac disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These patients have no discernible symptoms of celiac disease, but have a positive specific serologic test for celiac disease and biopsy evidence of villous atrophy.

(See <a href=\"#H208210423\" class=\"local\">'High-risk groups'</a> above.)</p><p>A majority of asymptomatic children with potential celiac disease will not develop celiac disease during childhood.

By a mean age of 29 &plusmn; 12 months, 24 children were diagnosed with potential celiac disease, defined as positive antibody tests but normal intestinal biopsies. These children with potential celiac disease continued a gluten-containing diet, and 86 percent became antibody-negative during the two-year follow-up period.

The most common complaints are abdominal pain, bloating, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> change in bowel patterns, but some patients complain of extraintestinal symptoms. The onset is typically within hours or a few days of ingesting gluten. This time course distinguishes NCGS from the rapid onset of symptoms in wheat allergy (minutes to hours), but can overlap with the delayed onset of symptoms in celiac disease (days to weeks) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F111975\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111975 \">table 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pathophysiology</strong> &ndash; In many patients with symptoms that they attribute to gluten, gluten is probably <strong>not</strong> a specific trigger. The symptoms are not replicated on double-blind food challenge, suggesting a placebo or non-gluten-related physiologic effect. An example of the latter are adults whose gastrointestinal symptoms appear to be induced by the fermentable poorly absorbed, short-chain carbohydrates (fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols; &quot;FODMAP&quot;). Since these sugars are also reduced in a gluten-free diet, the clinical response may result from reduction in the oligosaccharides rather than from elimination of the gluten itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. These patients are probably more accurately categorized as having irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) triggered by oligosaccharides rather than NCGS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-adults#H86846919\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of irritable bowel syndrome in adults&quot;, section on 'Gluten avoidance'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a smaller number of patients with these symptoms, it appears that gluten itself <strong>is</strong> the specific trigger for symptoms, in which case they are appropriately categorized as NCGS. This is suggested by the following studies:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A study has identified a cohort of children without serologic or histologic evidence of celiac disease or immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food allergy, in whom gastrointestinal symptoms were reproduced by a single-blind food challenge (in which the parent but not the child was aware of the gluten) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. This pattern may reflect a true gluten sensitivity, biased expectations by the parent, or symptoms caused by non-gluten carbohydrates in the diet. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a blinded gluten-free challenge in adults with IBS, those on a gluten-containing diet had significantly more bowel movements and increased small bowel permeability. The bowel symptoms were more common in <span class=\"nowrap\">HLA-DQ2/8-positive</span> subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Together, these studies suggest that a clinical response to a gluten-free diet may be caused by a variety of mechanisms, including placebo effect and FODMAP reduction, as well as by true gluten sensitivity in some of patients. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diagnosis</strong> &ndash; For children with symptoms that they attribute to gluten, it is important to test for both celiac disease and IgE-mediated wheat allergy. Testing should be performed <strong>before</strong> eliminating gluten from the diet because these tests may be falsely negative if performed while on a gluten-free diet. The diagnostic evaluation for celiac disease is discussed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children#H477986526\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of celiac disease in children&quot;, section on 'How to test'</a>), including strategies for evaluating patients who are already on a gluten-free diet.

However, no tests can reliably distinguish those with true NCGS from those with IBS or other symptoms that are not specifically related to gluten. Therefore, the diagnosis of NCGS should be approached with caution and should not be based solely on a short-term improvement in symptoms on a gluten-free diet. Neither antigliadin antibodies nor other biomarkers can reliably identify patients with NCGS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. The diagnosis of NCGS relies on patient-reported symptoms but can be made more objectively by use of a standardized questionnaire before and six weeks after instituting a gluten-free diet, or by use of a double-blind gluten challenge and crossover in patients already on a gluten-free diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Before a patient with suspected NCGS embarks on a gluten elimination diet, the patient and family should be educated on the possible reasons for a clinical response to this diet and counseled on the potential nutritional deficiencies associated with a gluten-free diet. Involving a knowledgeable dietitian in the care of children who are placed on a gluten free diet is highly recommended. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the past, celiac disease usually presented in infants and young children with malabsorption and failure to thrive.

This changing presentation of the disease may be due to longer periods of breastfeeding and the later introduction of gluten into the infant diet, and increasing recognition of subclinical disease due in part to advances in serological screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">&quot;Classical&quot; gastrointestinal symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Classically, celiac disease presented between 6 and 24 months of age, after the introduction of gluten into the diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The children have chronic diarrhea, anorexia, abdominal distension and pain, and failure to thrive or weight loss; some may also have vomiting.

When diarrhea is present, the stools are often bulky and foul-smelling, and may float because of trapped air. Flatulence and abdominal distension (caused by colonic bacterial digestion of malabsorbed nutrients) are common.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults#H33\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations of celiac disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Menstrual and reproductive issues'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Neurologic disease and behavioral symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurologic or behavioral symptoms may be associated with celiac disease, and occasionally are the primary symptoms. </p><p>Subtle or subclinical neurologic or behavioral abnormalities appear to be common; they may affect both the central and peripheral nervous systems. As an example, in a study of children with newly diagnosed celiac disease, almost 20 percent had subclinical neurologic abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. Among 27 children, two had peripheral polyneuropathy documented with electromyography, one had prolonged latencies in somatosensory evoked potential, and two had central magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities consisting of pontine demyelinization or cortical atrophy. Similarly, there is some evidence of regional brain hypoperfusion in adult patients with untreated celiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>]. In most, but not all such conditions, improvement is observed after treatment with a gluten-free diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/107-110\" class=\"abstract_t\">107-110</a>]. A separate study reported that 3.5-year-old children with persistently positive tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies on a gluten-containing diet were more likely to manifest subtle behavioral symptoms (anxiety, depression, aggressive behavior, or sleep problems) compared with those with negative antibody tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]. Unlike previous studies, the parents were unaware of the child's elevated tTG at the time that they reported the symptoms, avoiding that potential bias. This finding was no longer observed at 4.5 years of age.</p><p>Clinically apparent neurologic or psychiatric disorders also may be modestly increased in children following a diagnosis and initiation of treatment for celiac disease. The best evidence comes from a large case-control study in Sweden, which found that individuals with childhood-onset celiac disease had a 1.4-fold increased risk of developing a psychiatric disorder in long-term follow-up (median follow up 9.6 years), including mood, anxiety, eating, and behavioral disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder, and intellectual disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>]. This higher risk was not observed in siblings of the patients with celiac disease, arguing against a genetic component. Other less robust studies also suggest an association between celiac disease and mood disorders, behavioral disorders and developmental delay or ADHD, as well as headache and cerebellar ataxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/108,113-115\" class=\"abstract_t\">108,113-115</a>]. Epileptic disorders are only slightly more common among children with celiac disease, and there is no increase in frequency of tic disorders. Conversely, celiac disease does not appear to be overrepresented in groups of children with neurologic or psychiatric disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/114,116\" class=\"abstract_t\">114,116</a>]. </p><p>Several reports in adults have described an association between celiac disease and neuropsychiatric symptoms such as ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, depression, anxiety, or epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/107,117-122\" class=\"abstract_t\">107,117-122</a>].

Some of the disorders, such as infantile hypotonia and developmental delay, may be caused by malnutrition, including specific micronutrient deficiencies; these problems tend to resolve on a gluten-free diet. However, there is increasing evidence that some or all of these neurologic abnormalities are caused by autoimmune mechanisms. As an example, widespread immunoglobulin A (IgA) tTG deposition around blood vessels in the cerebellum has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>]. In particular, antiganglioside antibodies may be involved in the pathogenesis of neurologic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/124\" class=\"abstract_t\">124</a>], although relevant studies have yielded somewhat conflicting results. These findings suggest that an immune-mediated process may lead to gluten ataxia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> peripheral neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1151156284\"><span class=\"h3\">Liver disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies of children with celiac disease suggest that aminotransferase elevations are also common at diagnosis (15 to 35 percent), particularly in patients presenting with the classical symptoms of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/125-127\" class=\"abstract_t\">125-127</a>]. In most patients the aminotransferases normalize with a gluten-free diet. Similarly, mild elevations in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were seen in 42 percent of adult patients with celiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/128\" class=\"abstract_t\">128</a>]. Conversely, celiac disease is found in 5 to 10 percent of adults with chronic elevations of aminotransferases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/129\" class=\"abstract_t\">129</a>]. </p><p>Patients with celiac disease also appear to have increased risks for a broad spectrum of liver diseases, including acute hepatitis, primary biliary cholangitis (previously known as primary biliary cirrhosis), and chronic hepatitis including autoimmune hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/130-133\" class=\"abstract_t\">130-133</a>]. Several cases of severe liver disease with cirrhosis in children with celiac disease have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/134\" class=\"abstract_t\">134</a>], but celiac disease was not established as a causative factor.

Consequently, iron deficiency anemia is an indication for celiac screening in adults. The prevalence of iron deficiency is increased among children with celiac disease, and appears to be correlated with severity of mucosal injury. In one prospective study, the prevalence of low ferritin (defined in this case as &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/mL)</span> was 21 percent in patients with &quot;potential&quot; celiac disease; 35 percent in those with partial villous atrophy, and 87 percent among those with total villous atrophy, compared with 0 percent in healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/137\" class=\"abstract_t\">137</a>].

Dermatitis herpetiformis is the most common, occurring in up to 24 percent of adult patients with celiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/35,138\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,138</a>]. A few reports have suggested an association between psoriasis and elevated levels of antibodies to gliadin, reticulin, or tTG, but a strong association between psoriasis and celiac disease has not been documented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/139,140\" class=\"abstract_t\">139,140</a>]. Similar to celiac disease, anti-tTG antibodies are elevated in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, confirming the pathogenic similarities between these diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/141\" class=\"abstract_t\">141</a>].</p><p>Approximately 85 percent of adult patients with dermatitis herpetiformis have the characteristic changes of celiac disease on intestinal biopsy, although most have no gastrointestinal symptoms.

The predominant symptoms are itching and burning that is rapidly relieved with rupture of the blisters. The earliest abnormality comprises a small erythematous macule 2 to 3 mm in diameter that quickly develops into a papule. Small vesicles then appear to coalesce. Scratching causes them to rupture, dry up, and leave an area of pigmentation and scarring. The diagnosis can be confirmed by the demonstration of granular IgA deposition in an area of the skin not affected by blistering, along the subepidermal membrane. The results of the skin biopsy are sufficient to make the diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis.

The disorder is common, occurring in 0.5 to 1 percent of the general population in most countries. The grains that contain the triggering proteins are wheat, barley, and rye. The small intestinal mucosa improves morphologically when treated with a gluten-free diet and relapses when gluten is reintroduced.
