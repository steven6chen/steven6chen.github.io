There is a great deal of interest in finding a test or combination of tests that could detect ovarian cancer at an early, treatable stage. However, studies have not yet shown that screening tests decrease the risk of dying of ovarian cancer. Until more studies are completed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with no family history of ovarian cancer are advised to <strong>not</strong> have ovarian cancer screening unless enrolled in a <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/&amp;token=nbsXe3i4qfUea5RCPRHtOc5ko1zksgMm05jF47/USB3l0tvt+GAm3dUe1JoUg9nw&amp;TOPIC_ID=872\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">clinical trial</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with a &quot;high-risk&quot; family history of ovarian cancer are at increased risk of ovarian cancer. Women with a particularly high risk may benefit from ovarian cancer screening. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'High-risk family history'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>This article will review the risks and benefits of screening for ovarian cancer. Diagnosis, staging, and treatment of ovarian cancer are discussed separately.

An example of a common screening test is the Pap smear, which is used to detect cervical precancers and cancers.</p><p>A screening test must find most people with the condition and not mistakenly find people who do not have the condition. A test that is positive when no disease is present is termed a &quot;false positive&quot; test. It is especially important to avoid having false positive tests for ovarian cancer, since a positive screening test usually requires surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Benefits</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The potential benefit of ovarian cancer screening is the chance to find the cancer at a curable stage, reducing the risk of dying.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Risks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The potential risk of ovarian cancer screening is a falsely positive screening test. This might lead to unnecessary surgery for many healthy women. Surgery carries risks of anxiety, injury, and time out of work, as well as a small risk of serious complications; it is also expensive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING TESTS FOR HIGH-RISK WOMEN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies are being done to find the best combination of screening tests for ovarian cancer. Tests that may be useful for women at high risk of ovarian cancer include a blood test of the CA 125 tumor marker, ultrasonography, or a combination of the two.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">CA 125 tumor marker</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CA 125 is a protein that is higher than normal in approximately 80 percent of women with ovarian cancer. It can be measured with a blood test. CA 125 is commonly used to monitor women with ovarian cancer.</p><p>It was hoped that CA 125 could be used to know if a woman was at risk for ovarian cancer. However, CA 125 levels can be high with a variety of other conditions, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endometriosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uterine fibroids</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver disease (cirrhosis)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pelvic infections</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other cancers, including endometrial, breast, lung, and pancreatic cancer.</p><p/><p>Also, CA 125 levels are higher than normal in about 1 percent of healthy women, and the levels change during the menstrual cycle.</p><p>So if you have a higher than normal CA 125 level, you could have ovarian cancer or a more common and less serious condition. Pelvic ultrasound may be helpful to know if you have ovarian cancer, although the only way to know for sure if you have ovarian cancer is to have surgery. As a result, CA 125 is not recommended as a stand-alone screening test for ovarian cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Pelvic ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pelvic ultrasound uses sound waves to create an image of the organs in the pelvis, including the ovaries. The test usually involves using an ultrasound wand on the abdomen and inside the vagina.</p><p>When used as a screening test for ovarian cancer, vaginal ultrasound can find between 80 and 100 percent of ovarian cancers. However, ultrasound cannot always tell the difference between ovarian cancer and other more common conditions (ovarian cyst, endometriosis). False positive ultrasound tests (abnormal tests that do not indicate) may lead to more testing or unnecessary surgery to further evaluate the ovary. As a result, pelvic ultrasound is not recommended as a stand-alone screening test for ovarian cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Combined CA 125 and pelvic ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have looked at using CA 125 and pelvic ultrasound together to detect ovarian cancer. However, the results of these studies have been somewhat disappointing:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many women had unnecessary surgery because of false positive test results (the CA 125 or pelvic ultrasound was abnormal but no cancer was found).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some studies of CA 125 and pelvic ultrasound have found more cancers at an early, more treatable stage, while others have not. No published studies have shown that these tests reduce the risk of dying of ovarian cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">WHO SHOULD BE SCREENED?</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">High-risk family history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A woman with a &quot;high-risk&quot; family history is someone who has a strong family history of breast or ovarian cancer in more than one relative or has family members with cancer who have certain characteristics.</p><p>Women with this history should meet with a genetic counselor to discuss genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57434\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57434 \">table 1</a>). Genetic testing is discussed in a separate article. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-testing-for-breast-and-ovarian-cancer-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Genetic testing for breast and ovarian cancer (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Ovarian cancer screening may be recommended if you have a high risk family history of ovarian cancer and:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have a BRCA mutation and you have your ovaries</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have Lynch syndrome (also called hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer [HNPCC]) and you have your ovaries</p><p/><p>Ovarian cancer screening may also be considered for women who are eligible to have genetic testing (because of their high-risk family history) but who have chosen not to have genetic testing. In this group, ovarian cancer screening may be recommended, starting at age 30 to 35, or 5 to 10 years earlier than the age when the youngest family member was diagnosed. Screening may include a blood test for CA-125 and a pelvic ultrasound.</p><p>If you have a high risk family history, there are alternatives to ovarian cancer screening, such as having your ovaries removed to prevent cancer. These options are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-testing-for-breast-and-ovarian-cancer-beyond-the-basics#H8\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Genetic testing for breast and ovarian cancer (Beyond the Basics)&quot;, section on 'Interpreting the results'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Lower-risk family history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who do not meet the criteria for a high-risk family history should discuss their risks for ovarian cancer with a healthcare provider.

Symptoms may include pelvic or abdominal discomfort, bloating, difficulty eating or feeling full, increased abdominal size, or rushing to urinate frequently. However, these symptoms can also be caused by many other conditions.</p><p>If you have developed one or more of these symptoms in the past year, see your doctor or nurse.
