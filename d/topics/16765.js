By contrast, patients with advanced NSCLC are frequently treated with palliative intent using systemic therapy.

The median age of patients with newly diagnosed NSCLC in developed countries is approximately 68 years, and up to 40 percent are aged &ge;70 years at diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-therapy-for-advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer-in-elderly-patients-and-patients-with-a-poor-performance-status/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].
