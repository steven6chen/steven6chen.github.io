Postpartum psychosis (or puerperal psychosis) typically presents with rapid onset of psychotic symptoms including hallucinations and delusions, bizarre behavior, confusion, and disorganization that may appear to be delirium. </p><p>The syndrome is most often seen in patients that have been or will be diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but can also less frequently occur in women with major depression with psychosis, schizophrenia, or schizoaffective disorder. A small subset of women experience isolated postpartum psychosis that does not progress to mood or psychotic episodes outside the postpartum time period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-postpartum-psychosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>The treatment of postpartum psychosis is reviewed here. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis of postpartum psychosis are reviewed separately. The clinical manifestations, differential diagnosis and initial management of psychosis in adults are also reviewed separately. The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of other mental disorders occurring peripartum are also reviewed separately.

Ensuring safety and initiating medications for psychosis, agitation, and insomnia are the initial priorities of clinical management. Important next steps include evaluation and testing to exclude other medical causes of psychosis, and <span class=\"nowrap\">diagnosing/starting</span> treatment for an underlying psychiatric disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-postpartum-psychosis/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>]. </p><p>Postpartum psychosis is typically treated with a combination of antipsychotic medication and a mood stabilizer. Benzodiazepines and antidepressants are used to treat insomnia or depression, respectively, when present. Pharmacotherapy in this population needs to be considered in the context of the mother's status regarding breastfeeding. Adjunctive psychotherapy can be useful and includes psychoeducation, support, coordination of care, and encouraging treatment adherence.</p><p>Treatments for postpartum psychosis, a relatively rare syndrome, have not been tested in randomized clinical trials. Evidence evaluating interventions described here are limited to a small uncontrolled trial testing a clinical protocol <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-postpartum-psychosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Indirect evidence includes randomized trials of medications for the underlying psychotic disorders in non-postpartum samples.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1749454059\"><span class=\"h1\">SAFETY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first priority of treatment for postpartum psychosis is to ensure safety. A woman experiencing psychosis will generally not be able to care for herself or her baby without significant family support; she should usually be hospitalized until stable, though separation of mother and baby at this critical time is not optimal. The mother should not be left alone with the infant. Though uncommon, hospitals may make provisions for supervised daytime visits with the infant. Some countries including the United Kingdom and Australia have inpatient mother-baby psychiatric units, though these units are not widely available internationally.</p><p>The need for early identification of postpartum psychosis and emergent assessment of risks to the mother and baby are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-psychosis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum psychosis: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2502766441\"><span class=\"h2\">Breastfeeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with mild to moderate illness may be able to breastfeed. Patients who are more severely ill may be too disorganized or present too much of a risk to the baby to breastfeed. All psychotropic medications taken by the mother are transferred into breast milk and are passed on to the nursing infant. </p><p>The benefits of a psychotropic medication for the mother need to be weighed against risks to the infant from medication exposure. Some women will only take their medications if they are allowed to breastfeed. In such cases, the benefits of medication may supersede concerns about use of the drug in lactation. Breastfeeding women with postpartum psychosis should be monitored to ensure adequate rest and sleep. </p><p>The effects of antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>, and antidepressants on the infant are believed to be clinically insignificant based on limited data. There is no clear consensus on the safety of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> for the nursing infant. The benefits and risks of individual medications and electroconvulsive therapy are discussed elsewhere in the topic and in greater detail separately.

An antipsychotic is typically started while the patient&rsquo;s diagnostic evaluation is underway. Antipsychotic medication is generally used to treat psychosis regardless of its cause. </p><p>There are no clinical trials of the efficacy of antipsychotic drugs in the treatment of women with postpartum psychosis, though published reports suggest their use is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-postpartum-psychosis/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>]. Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of antipsychotics in reducing psychosis in psychotic disorders typically underlying postpartum psychosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-postpartum-psychosis/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. The rate of adverse effects from antipsychotics is comparable to that in nonpuerperal psychotic disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-differential-diagnosis-and-initial-management-of-psychosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, differential diagnosis, and initial management of psychosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The exposure of infants to antipsychotics via human milk generally appears to be low and clinically insignificant in the limited data available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-postpartum-psychosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

We suggest first-line treatment of patients with postpartum psychosis with one of the older, second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) rather than newer SGAs or first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs). SGAs are generally preferred over FGAs due to lower rates of extrapyramidal symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-postpartum-psychosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] and tardive dyskinesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-postpartum-psychosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Meta-analyses of clinical trials show that SGAs reduce symptoms of mania in bipolar disorder. Selection among individual SGAs are usually made on the basis of side effect profiles.</p><p>The choice of SGAs should be restricted to those with better safety data in pregnancy and lactation. Older SGAs, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quetiapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quetiapine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risperidone</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olanzapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olanzapine</a>, are preferred over <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aripiprazole-short-acting-oral-and-injectable-and-long-acting-injectable-abilify-maintena-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aripiprazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ziprasidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ziprasidone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iloperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">iloperidone</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=asenapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">asenapine</a> because of longer clinical experience and the safety data in pregnancy and lactation. However, if a woman has a history of nonresponse to an older SGA, a new SGA can be used.</p><p>For patients with psychosis and mild agitation, starting oral doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risperidone</a> (0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olanzapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olanzapine</a> (2.5 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quetiapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quetiapine</a> (initially 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> to 50 mg twice daily) can be used.

The dose should be adjusted with the goals of achieving remission while minimizing side effects. </p><p>Patients with more severe symptoms including agitation and sleeplessness may need higher doses of antipsychotics or a combination of psychiatric medications, including benzodiazepines <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mood stabilizing agents. </p><p>SGA antipsychotics vary in their side effect profiles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F82533\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82533 \">table 1</a>). Treatment with SGAs should be carefully monitored for side effects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F74435\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74435 \">table 2</a>); their use has been associated with hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and weight gain, as well as extrapyramidal symptoms.

The decision as to which drug to use should be made on a case-by-case basis based on side effect profiles and patient history of <span class=\"nowrap\">response/nonresponse</span>. FGAs have greater extrapyramidal side effects compared with SGAs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-postpartum-psychosis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>] and require monitoring for metabolic side effects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F74435\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74435 \">table 2</a>).

For mild agitation, 0.5 to 2 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a> may be sufficient; higher doses can be used for moderate (2 to 5 mg) or severe (5 to 10 mg) symptoms. An intramuscular injectable form of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olanzapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olanzapine</a> is a reasonable alternative, with a recommended dose of 10 mg, repeated at intervals of two to four hours, up to a total of 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ziprasidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ziprasidone</a> should be reserved for patients who fail to respond to the preferred antipsychotics because it is a newer agent with less available data on safety in lactation and pregnancy.

There are no randomized clinical trials comparing adjunctive or monotherapeutic benzodiazepines versus placebo in postpartum psychosis. A retrospective report described treatment of 64 inpatients treated for postpartum psychosis using a four-step algorithm: beginning with benzodiazepines, followed by the addition of antipsychotics, then <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a>, then electroconvulsive therapy. Only 6 percent of patients responded to benzodiazepine treatment alone; a majority of patients responded to a combination of medications including benzodiazepines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-postpartum-psychosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Case reports, small studies and our clinical experience support the use of benzodiazepines in psychosis and mania [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-postpartum-psychosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], particularly to promote sleep. Benzodiazepines are considered relatively safe during breastfeeding, though sedation is a potential side effect in the infant. &#160;</p><p>In selecting among benzodiazepines, we favor those with a short half-life and no active metabolites, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-postpartum-psychosis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].

In general, we suggest not using lithium for postpartum psychosis in women who are breastfeeding. Its use needs to be considered on a case-by-case basis, accounting for patient values and preferences regarding risks and benefits, including infant exposure versus a possibly greater risk of relapse for the mother with a mood stabilizer other than lithium. If lithium is used in breastfeeding women, it should be done with extreme caution and with blood levels of lithium in the baby monitored closely (eg, every one to two weeks during the first two months of life, monthly thereafter).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3163725410\"><span class=\"h4\">Valproate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women with postpartum psychosis who plan to breastfeed, we suggest treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a> rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a>.

The choice of antidepressant should be based on past response as well as the side effect profile; there are no known differences among antidepressants in their efficacy in postpartum psychosis. For treatment-na&iuml;ve patients, we suggest beginning treatment with an older selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sertraline</a>, as there is more evidence of safety in breastfeeding, and SSRIs are generally well tolerated.

Patients with previous episodes that responded well to medication can be treated with a previously successful medication or a combination of an antipsychotic and a mood stabilizer. An antidepressant can be added if a depressive episode does not remit with an antipsychotic and a mood stabilizer.

There are no randomized clinical trials on the efficacy of ECT in postpartum psychosis. Clinical trials have found ECT to be efficacious in the treatment of non-postpartum patients with major depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-postpartum-psychosis/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>], to suggest efficacy for bipolar depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-postpartum-psychosis/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>], and to show mixed results for bipolar mania [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-postpartum-psychosis/abstract/32-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-36</a>].

As an example, the retrospective study compared 58 women with postpartum psychosis treated with ECT with 56 matched, nonpuerperal women with psychosis treated with ECT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-postpartum-psychosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Women with postpartum psychosis had a greater rate of achieving &ldquo;marked improvement&rdquo; or an absence of symptoms at the end of ECT, compared with (65 versus 33 percent) the nonpuerperal sample [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-postpartum-psychosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. </p><p>Response to ECT is generally more rapid compared with response to medication; thus, ECT may be useful if a rapid response is needed to prevent harm, eg, the woman is at high risk for suicide or infanticide, is catatonic or acutely agitated. The number of treatments will depend on the severity of the symptoms. </p><p>ECT has a relatively low rate of adverse effects in the general population, including time-limited neurocognitive effects, rare cardiovascular or pulmonary compromise, and risks associated with general anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-postpartum-psychosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

The American Psychiatric Association Task Force on ECT recommends that the informed consent process include a discussion with the mother of potential risks to the infant from breastfeeding during a course of ECT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-postpartum-psychosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Anesthetic medications administered during ECT treatment generally pose little risk to breastfeeding infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-postpartum-psychosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Exposure can be minimized by delaying breastfeeding for a few hours after ECT therapy or by collecting and storing breast milk the day prior to ECT.

A woman experiencing psychosis will not be able to care for herself or her baby; she should usually be hospitalized until stable. The mother should not be left alone with the infant. (See <a href=\"#H3217751013\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1749454059\" class=\"local\">'Safety'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All psychotropic medications taken by a breastfeeding mother are passed on to the nursing infant. The benefits of medication for the mother need to be weighed against risks to the infant from exposure. The effects of second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), benzodiazepines, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a>, and antidepressants on the infant are believed to be clinically insignificant based on the limited data available.

We suggest first-line treatment of patients with postpartum psychosis with a SGA (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quetiapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quetiapine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risperidone</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olanzapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olanzapine</a>) rather a first-generation antipsychotic (FGA) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). SGAs have a lower rate of extrapyramidal symptoms and tardive dyskinesia compared with FGAs. We prefer older SGAs over newer SGAs due to longer experience with the older medications in a breast-feeding population.

(See <a href=\"#H1895242271\" class=\"local\">'Underlying mental disorder'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be treated with the antipsychotic to remission. Treatment should be continued for at least one year to reduce the risk of relapse; some patients will merit lifetime prophylaxis due to potential for relapse without medication and risk factors such as suicidality.
