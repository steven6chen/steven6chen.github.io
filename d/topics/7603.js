Although the risk of gastric cancer is increased in patients with intestinal metaplasia, the absolute risk is low. Specific subsets of patients with intestinal metaplasia may be at higher risk for progression. However, novel biomarkers are needed to better identify high-risk subgroups, and definitive studies are essential to determine the optimal interval for surveillance in patients at increased risk for gastric cancer. In addition, innovative endoscopy imaging modalities are expected to facilitate identification of gastric intestinal metaplasia.</p><p>This topic will review the epidemiology, natural history, diagnosis, and management of distal (noncardia) gastric intestinal metaplasia. The management of intestinal metaplasia at the gastric cardia (located immediately distal to the squamocolumnar junction and proximal to the oxyntic mucosa) and its distinction from Barrett's esophagus are discussed in detail, separately.

The most widely used and clinically useful classification is based on the histologic appearance with hematoxylin and eosin staining into the following subtypes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete intestinal metaplasia<strong> </strong>is defined by the presence of small intestinal-type mucosa with goblet cells, a brush border, and eosinophilic enterocytes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F81064\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81064 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incomplete intestinal metaplasia is defined by the presence of colonic epithelium with multiple, irregular mucin droplets of variable size in the cytoplasm and absence of a brush border (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F77310\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77310 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p/><p>Based on the extent of involvement on biopsy, intestinal metaplasia is classified into the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-intestinal-metaplasia/abstract/3,4,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,7,8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limited intestinal metaplasia is confined to one region of the stomach</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extensive intestinal metaplasia involves at least two areas of the stomach (eg, antrum, incisura, corpus)</p><p/><p>Intestinal metaplasia has also been subtyped based on mucin expression, but its use is limited to research settings. In intestinal metaplasia, original gastric mucins, which have a neutral pH, are replaced by acid mucins, which may be sialic or sulfated. Using a combination Alcian blue (AB) and high-iron diamine stain, gastric intestinal metaplasia is classified based on the types of mucins expressed and morphology into the following types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-intestinal-metaplasia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type I (complete) intestinal metaplasia expresses only sialomucins</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type II (incomplete) intestinal metaplasia expresses a mixture of gastric (neutral) mucins and intestinal sialomucins</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type III (incomplete) intestinal metaplasia expresses sulfomucins</p><p/><p>Combined periodic acid Schiff (PAS)-AB staining may also be used to discriminate between normal epithelium and intestinal metaplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-intestinal-metaplasia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, it is unclear whether the three types of intestinal metaplasia follow a chronologic sequence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-intestinal-metaplasia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19264616\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies that have evaluated the prevalence of intestinal metaplasia have had methodological limitations and have yielded widely varying estimates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-intestinal-metaplasia/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Although the prevalence of gastric intestinal metaplasia is unknown in many parts of the world, the prevalence is correlated with the regional gastric cancer incidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-intestinal-metaplasia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In one study in the United States in which 440 patients underwent a clinically indicated upper endoscopy, the overall prevalence of intestinal metaplasia was 19 percent, with prevalence rates in Caucasians and <span class=\"nowrap\">Hispanics/Blacks</span> of 13 percent and 50 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-intestinal-metaplasia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. A study in the United States highlights gastric intestinal metaplasia differences in the prevalence of gastric intestinal metaplasia among racial and ethnic groups. In a review of a national pathology database with nearly 800,000 subjects with gastric biopsies, the prevalence of gastric intestinal metaplasia among Hispanics and eastern Asians (Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese) was significantly higher as compared with all other racial and ethnic groups (12, 20, and 8 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-intestinal-metaplasia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]). In another observational study in the Netherlands that included 383 patients scheduled to undergo a colonoscopy for evaluation of gastrointestinal symptoms, 7 percent of patients had evidence of gastric intestinal metaplasia on upper endoscopy and biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-intestinal-metaplasia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The prevalence of gastric intestinal metaplasia also increases with age. </p><p>The current gastric adenocarcinoma multistage model, the &quot;Correa cascade,&quot; suggests that a combination of host genetic factors and responses, <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> genomics, with modulation by dietary and environmental factors, predispose to early pangastric mucosal inflammation, which in turn results in gastric atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and adenocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-intestinal-metaplasia/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. Risk factors for intestinal metaplasia are similar to those for gastric cancer in general, and include chronic infection with <em>H. pylori</em>, host genotypes, high salt intake, smoking, alcohol consumption, and chronic bile reflux [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-intestinal-metaplasia/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].

Evaluation of the subtype and extent of metaplasia requires gastric biopsy mapping, which consists of obtaining at least five nontargeted gastric biopsies (the lesser and greater curvature of the antrum and corpus, as well as from the incisura angularis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F90132\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90132 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>In patients at increased risk of gastric cancer (eg, family history of gastric cancer; non-Caucasian <span class=\"nowrap\">race/ethnicity,</span> including African-Americans, Hispanics, and Asians; first-generation immigrants from regions of high incidence, including eastern Asia and mountainous Latin America), we routinely perform gastric biopsy mapping on the index (initial) endoscopy. However, if gastric biopsy mapping was not performed on index upper endoscopy and the diagnosis of gastric intestinal metaplasia was made incidentally based on fewer biopsies, in a patient at increased risk of gastric cancer, we perform a repeat upper endoscopy with biopsy mapping within three years to determine the histologic subtype and extent of intestinal metaplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-intestinal-metaplasia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, in average-risk patients in whom the diagnosis of intestinal metaplasia is made incidentally, the decision to repeat an upper endoscopy for gastric biopsy mapping should be individualized (eg, based on patient age, comorbidities, preference, and other risk factors for gastric cancer).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19264183\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastric intestinal metaplasia is an important intermediate stage in the gastric cancer cascade through a series of well-defined and recognizable precursors. These precursor lesions include nonatrophic gastritis, multifocal atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, and dysplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-intestinal-metaplasia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology and molecular pathogenesis of gastric cancer&quot;, section on 'Intestinal type cancers'</a>.)</p><p>The metaplastic foci often first appear at the antrum-corpus junction, and frequently at the incisura angularis. As the process advances, the foci enlarge and coalesce, extending to the neighboring mucosa in both the antrum and the corpus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-intestinal-metaplasia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. As atrophic and metaplastic glands replace original glands, normal gastric secretions decrease, leading to hypochlorhydria and to low levels of pepsinogen produced by the chief cells of the corpus, and to high circulating levels of gastrin produced by antral G cells. The first metaplastic glands seen in the gastric mucosa phenotypically resemble those of the small intestine, with eosinophilic absorptive enterocytes with a brush border, alternating with mucus-producing goblet cells. This is type I, complete or small intestinal metaplasia. More advanced stages are characterized by phenotypic changes that are similar to colonic mucosa with the glands being lined by irregular goblet cells (type III, incomplete or colonic metaplasia) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F81064\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81064 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F77310\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77310 \">picture 2</a>).

However, further studies are needed to validate NBI patterns in gastric intestinal metaplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-intestinal-metaplasia/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>].

Confocal endomicroscopy is based upon the principle of illuminating a tissue with a low-power laser and then detecting fluorescent light reflected from the tissue. The laser is focused at a specific depth and only light reflected back from that plane is refocused and able to pass through the pinhole confocal aperture. As a result, scattered light from above and below the plane of interest is not detected, increasing spatial resolution. The area being examined is scanned in the horizontal and vertical planes and an image is reconstructed. The applications and efficacy of confocal microscopy are discussed in detail, separately.

In addition, studies that have evaluated the effect of antioxidant vitamin supplementation (eg, ascorbic acid, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-carotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">beta-carotene</a>) on the risk of progression of gastric precancerous lesions have yielded inconsistent results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-intestinal-metaplasia/abstract/25,66-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,66-69</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2409592\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastric intestinal metaplasia is characterized by the replacement of the surface, foveolar, and glandular epithelium in the oxyntic or antral mucosa by intestinal epithelium. Complete intestinal metaplasia<strong> </strong>is characterized by small intestinal-type mucosa with goblet cells, a brush border, and eosinophilic enterocytes. Incomplete intestinal metaplasia is characterized by colonic epithelium with multiple, irregular mucin droplets of variable size in the cytoplasm, and absence of a brush border. Intestinal metaplasia is considered limited if confined to one area of the stomach and extensive if present in at least two areas of the stomach (eg, antrum, corpus, incisura). (See <a href=\"#H2409463\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H539680233\" class=\"local\">'Subtypes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intestinal metaplasia is an intermediate stage within the cascade of precursor lesions that lead to gastric cancer. The overall risk of progression to gastric cancer in patients with intestinal metaplasia is low in areas with low gastric cancer incidence (2.5 per 1000 person-years). Among patients with gastric intestinal metaplasia, the risk of gastric cancer appears to be higher in individuals with extensive and incomplete intestinal metaplasia (16.5 per 1000 person-years). (See <a href=\"#H2409463\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19264183\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology and molecular pathogenesis of gastric cancer&quot;, section on 'Intestinal type cancers'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intestinal metaplasia by itself does not cause symptoms. However, it is associated with gastric hypochlorhydria, which may result in small intestinal bacterial overgrowth with symptoms of bloating, flatulence, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea. On upper endoscopy, intestinal metaplasia has a nonspecific appearance and involved mucosa may have rough or villous appearance, or may be seen as thin, white mucosal deposits. (See <a href=\"#H1574292\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of gastric intestinal metaplasia is based on pathological evaluation of gastric biopsies. Evaluation of the subtype and extent of metaplasia requires gastric biopsy mapping, which consists of obtaining at least five nontargeted gastric biopsies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F90132\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90132 \">figure 1</a>). In patients at increased risk of gastric cancer (eg, family history of gastric cancer; non-Caucasian <span class=\"nowrap\">race/ethnicity,</span> including African-Americans, Hispanics, and Asians; first-generation immigrants from regions of high incidence, including Eastern Asia and mountainous Latin America), we routinely perform gastric biopsy mapping on the index (initial) endoscopy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If gastric biopsy mapping was not performed on index upper endoscopy in a patient at increased risk of gastric cancer and the diagnosis of gastric intestinal metaplasia is made incidentally, then we perform a repeat upper endoscopy with biopsy mapping within three years to determine the histologic subtype and extent of intestinal metaplasia. In average risk patients in whom the diagnosis is made incidentally, the decision to repeat an upper endoscopy for biopsy mapping should be individualized (eg, based on patient age, comorbidities, preference, and other risk factors for gastric cancer). (See <a href=\"#H5283615\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation to determine the subtype of intestinal metaplasia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In individuals with extensive <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> incomplete intestinal metaplasia, we perform surveillance upper endoscopy with biopsy mapping every two to three years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F90130\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef90130 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F90132\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90132 \">figure 1</a>). For high-risk subjects without incomplete or extensive metaplasia, the decision to perform endoscopic surveillance should be individualized. (See <a href=\"#H2409463\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H88656362\" class=\"local\">'Upper endoscopy with biopsy mapping'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be screened for <em>H. pylori</em> by histology and, if negative, by noninvasive testing. Although eradication of <em>H. pylori</em> does not reverse intestinal metaplasia and may only slow progression to gastric cancer, eradication therapy is indicated given the favorable risk-benefit ratio. (See <a href=\"#H3512913\" class=\"local\">'Eradication of Helicobacter pylori'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-and-diagnostic-tests-for-helicobacter-pylori-infection#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications and diagnostic tests for Helicobacter pylori infection&quot;, section on 'Noninvasive testing'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-regimens-for-helicobacter-pylori#H545843828\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment regimens for Helicobacter pylori&quot;, section on 'Initial antibiotic therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While several other endoscopic imaging modalities exist, further studies are needed before they can be routinely recommended for surveillance in patients with gastric intestinal metaplasia. Novel imaging methods are expected to increase the detection of gastric intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia, and improve the sensitivity of upper endoscopy for premalignant lesions. (See <a href=\"#H101715825\" class=\"local\">'Other imaging modalities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3446948179\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Pelayo Correa, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-intestinal-metaplasia/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Correa P.
