When these swings become intolerable and cause disruption to the person's daily life <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prolonged hospitalization, the person is labeled as having &quot;labile&quot; or &quot;brittle&quot; diabetes. Although brittle diabetes is uncommon (less than 1 percent of insulin-taking diabetic patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adult-patient-with-brittle-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], it can cause a considerable burden on hospital, social, and family resources due to multiple hospital admissions.</p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of brittle diabetes will be reviewed here.

The unpredictable episodes of hypoglycemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ketoacidosis are due to an absolute insulin dependency (undetectable C-peptide levels). Thus, brittle diabetic patients virtually always have type 1 diabetes.</p><p>The majority of the published clinical literature regarding brittle diabetes is old with few modern-day descriptions of brittle diabetes encompassing the era of intensive insulin therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adult-patient-with-brittle-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. With the availability of basal and bolus insulin regimens, using long and rapid-acting insulin analogs or insulin pump therapy, there has been substantial improvement in the ability to treat most patients with type 1 diabetes effectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adult-patient-with-brittle-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Although most clinical experts in the management of type 1 diabetes continue to see patients with brittle diabetes mellitus, many of whom have a substantial behavioral or iatrogenic contribution to their brittle state, the modern-day course of such patients has not been well described.</p><p>Three clinical presentations of brittle diabetes have been described: (1) predominant hyperglycemia with recurrent ketoacidosis, (2) predominant hypoglycemia, and (3) mixed hyper- and hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adult-patient-with-brittle-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Frequent hypoglycemia, even if asymptomatic, causes both defective glucose counterregulation and hypoglycemia unawareness and, thus, a vicious cycle of recurrent hypoglycemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiologic response to hypoglycemia in normal subjects and patients with diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with brittle diabetes have wide swings in their blood sugar levels and report differing blood sugar responses to the same dose and type of insulin. Historically, glycated hemoglobin (A1C) levels are typically elevated (10 to 14 percent), and acute (ketoacidosis, severe hypoglycemia) and chronic (neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy) diabetes complications are common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adult-patient-with-brittle-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. Most patients are in their 20s and 30s, although older patients may also have brittle diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adult-patient-with-brittle-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Although some patients are able to control their blood sugars with time, the overall mortality rate for patients with brittle diabetes is high, ranging from 20 to 50 percent in series from specialist centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adult-patient-with-brittle-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1,2,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,7,8</a>]. In one series, the causes of death were chronic renal failure, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), hypoglycemia, and subarachnoid hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adult-patient-with-brittle-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The age at death ranged from 27 to 45 years. In contrast to an older review, which found an equal prevalence in men and women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adult-patient-with-brittle-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], all of the other series found a predominance of young women, and one noted a significant increase in microvascular diabetic complications (67 versus 25 percent in stable diabetic controls) and pregnancy complications (46 versus 7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adult-patient-with-brittle-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Among survivors, the insulin dose tended to drop over time, and episodes of ketoacidosis and severe hypoglycemia became less frequent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4990844\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brittle diabetes is labile or unstable diabetes, which requires frequent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prolonged hospitalizations for ketoacidosis or severe hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adult-patient-with-brittle-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Thus, the diagnosis of brittle diabetes is established when a patient with absolute insulin deficiency (type 1 or rarely longstanding type 2 diabetes mellitus) has frequent episodes of severe hyper- <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypoglycemia, requiring frequent hospitalizations and preventing a normal lifestyle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2935579\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are multiple causes of brittle diabetes. The major cause of brittle diabetes is nonphysiologic matching of <span class=\"nowrap\">meals/exercise</span> and insulin administration either by clinicians or patients. Potential physiologic causes include malabsorption, delayed gastric emptying due to autonomic neuropathy, impairment of behavioral and counterregulatory responses to falling plasma glucose concentrations, use of certain drugs (alcohol, antipsychotics), systemic insulin resistance, and abnormal insulin absorption or degradation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adult-patient-with-brittle-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Several studies from specialist referral centers in the late 1970s and early 1980s focused on possible physiologic mechanisms for the brittleness and tried mechanistic approaches to overcome the problem by using continuous subcutaneous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adult-patient-with-brittle-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], intramuscular, intravenous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adult-patient-with-brittle-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], or intraperitoneal insulin infusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adult-patient-with-brittle-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>], or the closed-loop artificial pancreas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adult-patient-with-brittle-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, with increasing study, it has become clear that the vast majority of cases appear to be due to psychological factors, with patient-centered behavioral issues often underlying the poor glycemic control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adult-patient-with-brittle-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1,7,8,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,8,14</a>]. When &quot;brittle&quot; diabetic patients were studied in a controlled environment with regimented meals and exercise and insulin dosing choices made by and administered by the health care team, their labile glycemic state often improved and they were no longer brittle. As an example, in an attempt to estimate the prevalence and causes of brittle diabetes, a questionnaire was sent to all diabetes clinics in the United Kingdom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adult-patient-with-brittle-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Among the 414 patients with brittle diabetes identified (prevalence of 2.9 per 1000 insulin-treated patients), the responding clinicians believed that 93 percent of cases were due to psychological problems. Some of these problems may be short-lived and related to a stressful situation (unhappiness at school or home), which causes the patient to neglect their diabetes care. In other, rarer settings, a patient may deliberately mismanage his or her diabetes (factitious brittle diabetes) in order to remain in the hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adult-patient-with-brittle-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>After eliminating the behavioral aspects of brittle diabetes and improving the physiologic match between insulin delivery and insulin requirements, there are still a small number of patients with type 1 diabetes who will remain inexplicably brittle. With further investigation, erratic meal absorption from gastroparesis or with unrecognized celiac disease may be identified. In some patients, perhaps owing to high levels of anti-insulin antibodies from prior use of animal species insulins, the absorption or biologic activity of insulin may be unpredictable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2935572\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A careful evaluation should be performed in patients with brittle diabetes to differentiate among the various causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adult-patient-with-brittle-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/3,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,16</a>]. In evaluating a patient with brittle diabetes, it is important to take a detailed history to include several specific points, such as the duration of diabetes, a description of all episodes of ketoacidosis and severe hypoglycemia, presence of diabetes complications (particularly autonomic neuropathy), and prescribed insulin regimens. It should also be determined if there was a period of &quot;stable&quot; diabetes preceding the brittleness and what happened in the patient's life circumstances coincident with the onset of brittleness. Because psychosocial factors are an important contributor to disease instability, psychosocial assessment is an important component of the evaluation, particularly for patients with brittle diabetes in whom diabetes education and intensive insulin therapy fail to reduce the episodes of ketoacidosis and hypoglycemia. (See <a href=\"#H2934997\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below.)</p><p>For patients with recurrent episodes of severe hypoglycemia, a number of conditions should be considered:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastroparesis can lead to a severe mismatch between food absorption and insulin absorption, causing unexplained hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adult-patient-with-brittle-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Gastric emptying studies <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a trial of medical therapy may be helpful in this setting. Evaluation of gastroparesis is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic autonomic neuropathy of the gastrointestinal tract&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Celiac disease can cause erratic absorption of meals, causing unexplained hypoglycemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations of celiac disease in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of celiac disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The protective response to hypoglycemia is impaired in many patients with type 1 diabetes and in some patients with longstanding (absolute endogenous insulin deficient) type 2 diabetes. Impaired glucose counterregulation is a major risk factor for recurrent hypoglycemia. In addition, previous episodes of hypoglycemia further impair glucose counterregulation and cause hypoglycemia unawareness, causing a vicious cycle of recurrent hypoglycemia in which recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia make subsequent episodes more likely. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiologic response to hypoglycemia in normal subjects and patients with diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Response to hypoglycemia in diabetes'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiologic response to hypoglycemia in normal subjects and patients with diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Measuring symptomatic and counterregulatory hormone response to hypoglycemia, although accurate in determining the risk of severe hypoglycemia, is too cumbersome for routine use. A simpler and more practical approach during intensive insulin therapy is to evaluate the frequency and severity of low blood glucose readings from blood glucose monitoring records kept by the patient or from continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose-in-management-of-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Self-monitoring of blood glucose in management of adults with diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency are also causes, albeit rarely, of recurrent severe hypoglycemia; they can be treated easily once the condition is recognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adult-patient-with-brittle-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Thus, thyroid function tests (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH], free thyroxine [T4]) and a corticotropin (ACTH) stimulation test should be performed if the clinical history is suggestive of hypothyroidism or glucocorticoid deficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-hypothyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of and screening for hypothyroidism in nonpregnant adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insulin autoimmune hypoglycemia occurs in patients who have antibodies directed to endogenous insulin or to the insulin receptor. Symptoms can occur postprandially, fasting, or in both states. In patients with insulin autoantibodies, insulin secreted in response to a meal binds to the antibody and then disassociates in an unregulated fashion causing hyperinsulinemia and hypoglycemia. In patients with antibodies to the insulin receptor, hypoglycemia occurs as a result of antibody activation of the receptor. Measurement of insulin and insulin receptor antibodies is necessary to confirm the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adult-patient-with-brittle-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypoglycemia-in-adults-without-diabetes-mellitus-diagnostic-approach#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypoglycemia in adults without diabetes mellitus: Diagnostic approach&quot;, section on 'Determining the cause of hypoglycemia'</a>.)</p><p/><p>For patients with recurrent episodes of ketoacidosis, a possible chronic cryptic infection (such as sinusitis, osteomyelitis, renal or perinephric abscess, lung abscess) should be excluded. These problems are more likely in a patient using intravenous drugs. Thus, a urinary drug screen for opiates and amphetamines may be helpful if drug use is suspected.</p><p>For all patients, a diabetic educational assessment is useful to evaluate whether the patient knows how to manage diabetes and whether the current insulin regimen is reasonable.</p><p>If deliberate mismanagement (factitious brittle diabetes) by a patient is suspected, in-hospital assessment and management of blood sugars are necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adult-patient-with-brittle-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. During the initial period, the patient has to stay on the treatment unit at all times, where he or she can be closely monitored and observed, with all blood glucose testing, food, and insulin being administered by the staff. Subsequently, the patient may be allowed to become involved in his or her management, provided blood glucose control and behavior remain reasonable. Many patients with so-called &quot;brittle&quot; diabetes will have relatively easy-to-control diabetes in this setting, clearly suggesting that behavioral or regimen-based problems underlie their brittle state as an outpatient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2934997\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to management will obviously vary depending on the specific etiology in each case. However, regardless of the cause, brittle diabetes is difficult to treat.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H857118\"><span class=\"h2\">General principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diabetes education is important for the patient who is struggling with insulin dosing and dietary prescriptions. Patients need to be instructed on how to match the insulin dose to the amount of carbohydrates ingested at each meal. In addition, insulin regimens must be individually tailored to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia, while maintaining or improving glycemic control. Health care professionals who treat patients with insulin-dependent diabetes should have expertise in the principles of insulin management. Patient education and empowerment, frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), flexible and rational insulin (and other drug) regimens, individualized glycemic goals, and ongoing professional guidance and support are required to meet these goals. Carbohydrate counting, insulin therapy (multiple daily injections or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion [insulin pump]), and strategies to prevent hypoglycemia are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutritional-considerations-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutritional considerations in type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Carbohydrate consistency'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of blood glucose in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Choice of insulin delivery'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hypoglycemia-during-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hypoglycemia during treatment of diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Strategies to prevent hypoglycemia'</a>.)</p><p>Regular SMBG is critical to the glycemic management of type 1 and intensively treated <span class=\"nowrap\">(basal/bolus</span> insulin) type 2 diabetes. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) may further facilitate glycemic control or at least a more clear understanding of the time periods when glucose control is problematic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose-in-management-of-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Self-monitoring of blood glucose in management of adults with diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Continuous glucose monitoring'</a>.)</p><p>Continuous subcutaneous insulin (insulin pump) has also been used in conjunction with a CGM device to give the patient more information about their blood glucose levels and allow them to make better informed decisions about insulin dosing. This approach, known as sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy, may improve glycemic control without an increase in the rate of severe hypoglycemia. Studies are currently evaluating the efficacy of a fully automated closed loop system of insulin delivery based upon continuous glucose sensing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of blood glucose in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (insulin pump)'</a>.)</p><p>If there is a history of hypoglycemia unawareness, a two- to three-week period of scrupulous avoidance of hypoglycemia is advisable since that often restores awareness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hypoglycemia-during-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hypoglycemia during treatment of diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Hypoglycemia unawareness'</a>.)</p><p>Pancreas transplantation is an option for the small minority of patients with a history of severe and frequent metabolic complications (hypoglycemia, ketoacidosis) and a consistent failure of insulin-based management to prevent these complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adult-patient-with-brittle-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus#H867495\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pancreas and islet transplantation in diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Indications for transplantation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H857125\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastroparesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although gastroparesis can lead to a severe mismatch between food absorption and insulin absorption, causing unexplained hypoglycemia, there are no conclusive data showing that treatment of gastric stasis improves long-term diabetic control or prevents complications. In a randomized, controlled trial of eight patients with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes and delayed gastric emptying, cisapride 20 mg twice daily improved gastric emptying time significantly but had no beneficial effects on day-to-day glucose variability, A1C, or frequency of hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adult-patient-with-brittle-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In addition, cisapride has been associated with a number of drug interactions and fatal cardiac arrhythmias, prompting the manufacturer to severely restrict its availability in the United States, although it remains available in several other countries. Thus, while cisapride may help relieve the symptoms of gastroparesis, it does not appear to help with metabolic control. Given these findings and the drug's restricted status, we do not recommend cisapride for the management of unexplained hypoglycemia due to gastroparesis. Gastroparesis is reviewed in detail separately.

Nevertheless, many patients will continue to be admitted with recurrent problems until their general life situation improves. Referral to a specialty center may be indicated in severe cases. This is particularly important if there is a possibility that the clinician (or another team member) is becoming so involved with the patient's case that they may lose objectivity or be manipulated by the patient. Patients who are using their brittleness to escape from an unhappy situation in the outside world may use the hospital as a sanctuary, become very familiar with all the staff, bend the rules for their own convenience, and interfere with their management in bizarre ways to ensure that they need to remain hospitalized.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1112095314\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

(See <a href=\"#H4990844\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major cause of brittle diabetes is patient or clinician errors in management, particularly nonphysiologic matching of <span class=\"nowrap\">meals/exercise</span> and insulin administration. Other potential causes of brittle diabetes include psychosocial problems, malabsorption, delayed gastric emptying due to autonomic neuropathy, impairment of behavioral and counterregulatory responses to falling plasma glucose concentrations, use of certain drugs (alcohol, antipsychotics), systemic insulin resistance, and abnormal insulin absorption or degradation, or a combination of the above. (See <a href=\"#H2935579\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A careful evaluation should be performed in patients with brittle diabetes to differentiate among the various causes. It is important to take a detailed history to include several specific points, such as the duration of diabetes, a description of all episodes of ketoacidosis and severe hypoglycemia, prescribed insulin regimens, and the presence of diabetes complications (particularly autonomic neuropathy, which may be indicative of gastroparesis). Because psychosocial factors are important contributor to disease instability, psychosocial assessment is an important component of the evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H2935572\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment of brittle diabetes includes diabetes education, intensive insulin therapy (multiple daily injections or insulin pump) with frequent or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), and frequent interaction between patient and clinician. Health care professionals who treat patients with insulin dependent diabetes should have expertise in the principles of insulin management. For the small minority of patients who comply with intensive insulin therapy and educational programs but have persistent, recurrent, and disabling hypoglycemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ketoacidosis, pancreas or islet cell transplantation may be effective. In patients with a clear psychosocial component to diabetes instability, a psychological evaluation is warranted since psychotherapy has been shown to be effective in selected patients.
