As there is no effective vaccine to prevent HIV transmission, behavioral and biomedical HIV prevention strategies are needed to reduce HIV acquisition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. For HIV-uninfected patients, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) using antiretroviral medications is an evidence-based way to prevent new infections among those at greatest risk.</p><p>This topic will review how to administer PrEP to appropriate candidates. A discussion of how to assess patients for PrEP and other strategies to prevent HIV infection (eg, the use of antiretroviral therapy for HIV-infected patients, post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV-uninfected patients, and male circumcision) are discussed elsewhere.

Among those who are adherent, PrEP using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate-and-emtricitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-emtricitabine</a> (TDF-FTC) can reduce the risk of HIV transmission by greater than 90 percent, although rare infections may still occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. </p><p>The initial evaluation of a patient who is interested in initiating PrEP is summarized below and described in detail elsewhere:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinicians should obtain a detailed sexual and drug use history to determine if the patient is at high risk of HIV acquisition, and therefore likely to benefit from PrEP.

PrEP is generally not needed for patients who consistently engage in low-risk sexual behaviors (eg, consistent condom use when engaging in anal or vaginal intercourse, no mucosal exposure to genital secretions). Specific indications for PrEP, as well as considerations for certain populations (eg, patients with osteoporosis or hepatitis B virus infection, pregnant women), are described elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-hiv-pre-exposure-prophylaxis#H2884818675\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient evaluation and selection for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis&quot;, section on 'Candidates for PrEP'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7740420\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTIVIRAL THERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2748216082\"><span class=\"h2\">Preferred regimen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), the coformulated tablet of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate-and-emtricitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-emtricitabine</a> (TDF-FTC) should be administered once daily for as long as the risk of infection persists. Discussions of duration of therapy and alternative dosing regimens are found below. (See <a href=\"#H154191694\" class=\"local\">'Duration of pre-exposure prophylaxis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3205586337\" class=\"local\">'Alternatives to daily oral therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>TDF-FTC should be dispensed as a 90-day supply, renewable only after HIV testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Prescribing a limited quantity of medication increases the likelihood that a patient will follow up for ongoing safety monitoring and adherence counseling. (See <a href=\"#H3363385551\" class=\"local\">'Patient monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients should be counseled to use condoms in addition to using PrEP (see <a href=\"#H2326550487\" class=\"local\">'Condom use'</a> below), but some patients may choose not to use condoms. For such patients, we encourage condoms until TDF achieves intracellular drug concentrations that protect against HIV. Based upon pharmacokinetic data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>], we advise condom use for: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seven days after starting PrEP for patients engaging in receptive anal sex. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Twenty-one days after starting PrEP for patients engaging in receptive vaginal sex.</p><p/><p>This approach is consistent with the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], although the World Health Organization guidelines suggest that condom use can be discontinued after seven days for both receptive anal and receptive vaginal sex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The reason for the debate is based upon different interpretations of pharmacokinetic data and not on clinical trials. Thus, when discussing the time from PrEP initiation to optimal protection, the clinician should assess the patient's level of ongoing risk, desire for certainty, and likelihood of adherence. There are no clear data on the concentration of tenofovir in penile tissues. However, it may be reasonable for men who only engage in insertive sex to use condoms for at least one week.</p><p>Once daily TDF-FTC is the most widely studied regimen among various populations. Clinical trials have described only mild adverse effects (eg, nausea, vomiting) compared with placebo, and these usually resolve during the first four weeks. However, there are concerns for renal and bone toxicity with long-term use. (See <a href=\"#H2331477763\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of oral pre-exposure prophylaxis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-hiv-pre-exposure-prophylaxis#H1394697050\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient evaluation and selection for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis&quot;, section on 'Assessing risk of treatment'</a>.)</p><p>A new form of tenofovir, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenofovir-alafenamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tenofovir alafenamide</a> (TAF), has less bone and renal toxicity compared with TDF and is effective in suppressing HIV RNA when used as part of a combination regimen for HIV-infected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Although TAF is used in patients who are HIV infected, there are insufficient data to support the use of TAF in place of TDF as PrEP; in addition, the findings from early studies of TAF for PrEP have been conflicting. As an example, TAF results in lower mucosal tenofovir levels compared with TDF (which may therefore make TAF less effective as PrEP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]; however, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenofovir-alafenamide-and-emtricitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tenofovir alafenamide-emtricitabine</a> (TAF-FTC) protected six monkeys who were challenged with <span class=\"nowrap\">simian/human</span> immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A large multicenter, multinational efficacy study comparing TAF-FTC with TDF-FTC for PrEP is underway, and should be able to determine the relative benefits of either regimen for PrEP.</p><p>Multiple other trials and demonstration projects are being conducted globally to examine other agents (eg, novel integrase inhibitors such as cabotegravir, CCR5 receptor antagonists) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>].

However, until data are available, regimens other than TDF-FTC should <strong>not</strong> be used for PrEP, even if there is concern that a patient may be exposed to drug-resistant virus.

There is a clear association between adherence to the drug regimen and the efficacy of PrEP in decreasing HIV transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection/abstract/18-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-26</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2331477763\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of oral pre-exposure prophylaxis'</a> below.)</p><p>The relationship between adherence and PrEP efficacy has been found in all populations (eg, men who have sex with men, transgender women, heterosexual men and women). However, patients exclusively engaging in receptive anal sex may be able to miss an occasional dose and still be protected. In a trial that evaluated 1225 men who engaged in anal sex and received daily TDF-FTC, taking at least four doses per week was associated with a high level of protection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. By contrast, data suggest that six or seven doses per week are needed to protect patients who are exposed to HIV through vaginal intercourse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. This difference may be due to the high concentration of tenofovir achieved in rectal tissues, which is greater than that seen in cervicovaginal tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2326550487\"><span class=\"h3\">Condom use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients should be counseled to use condoms whenever possible (in addition to using PrEP) to reduce the risk of acquiring other sexually transmitted infections and because rare transmissions have occurred, even in the setting of appropriate PrEP medication adherence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].

Such patients remain at risk for acquiring other viral and bacterial infections (eg, hepatitis C virus and <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>) that can be transmitted through unsafe injection practices. It is also important to educate patients about pharmacologic and behavioral treatments to reduce both injection and noninjection drug use.

In a meta-analysis that evaluated drug resistance in six clinical trials, drug resistance was identified in 6 of the 533 patients who became HIV infected after enrollment, and 8 of the 44 patients who had undiagnosed acute HIV infection at study entry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. If drug-resistant HIV is detected, it can be acquired (ie, the patient was infected with wild-type virus but develops resistance because <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> is taking PrEP), or it can be transmitted from their partner (the virus they were infected with already had drug resistance mutations). </p><p>Detailed discussions of the evaluation and management of patients with drug-resistant virus are found elsewhere.

By contrast, the genetic barrier to resistance is high for tenofovir, and, therefore, resistance to tenofovir (eg, K65R mutation) is less likely to occur. Exposure to study drug was believed to cause drug resistance in 4 of the 33 women in the Fem-PrEP trial and in 2 of the 51 patients in the Partners PrEP study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection/abstract/29,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,31</a>]. Among those who developed resistance, the M184V emtricitabine resistance mutation was the most frequent. A more detailed discussion of HIV drug resistance mutations is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=interpretation-of-hiv-drug-resistance-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Interpretation of HIV drug resistance testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H41796440\"><span class=\"h3\">Transmitted drug resistance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients receiving PrEP may be infected with drug-resistant HIV. In two case reports, a patient became infected with HIV that contained drug resistance mutations for several classes of antiretroviral agents, including tenofovir and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emtricitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">emtricitabine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Transmission occurred despite tenofovir levels that were consistent with recent administration of the drug and long-term adherence. Thus, it is important to educate patients about the benefits of condom use in addition to PrEP. (See <a href=\"#H985432278\" class=\"local\">'Patient counseling'</a> above.) </p><p>No antiretrovirals besides TDF-FTC have been proven to be effective when used for PrEP. Thus, if a patient has a known exposure to multidrug-resistant HIV, a post-exposure prophylaxis regimen should be initiated that contains antiretrovirals active against the resistant virus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-nonoccupational-exposures-to-hiv-and-hepatitis-b-and-c-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of nonoccupational exposures to HIV and hepatitis B and C in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3205586337\"><span class=\"h2\">Alternatives to daily oral therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients do not want to take daily oral therapy. Alternative dosing approaches may be an option for certain patients who can reliably predict when they will have condomless sex. If an alternative dosing regimen is being considered, it is important to inform patients that there is much less experience with these dosing regimens, and some have not been tested. In addition, patients may have difficulty remembering to take therapy that is not administered daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>The decision to administer an alternative dosing regimen, and the type of regimen, depend upon the patient's pattern of sexual activity. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who anticipate a discrete period of risk (eg, going on vacation), one option would be to start daily PrEP prior to the period when the patient is planning to have condomless sex and continue PrEP for one month after. If this approach is used, therapy should be initiated at least one week before high-risk sexual activity for a male patient and three weeks before for a female patient. This approach is supported by pharmacokinetic data predicting protective levels of intracellular TDF and FTC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]; it has not been completely evaluated in clinical trials.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who engage in condomless anal sex, another alternative would be on-demand (event-driven) therapy, in which a loading dose (two tablets of TDF-FTC) is taken 2 to 24 hours prior to sexual activity, one tablet is then taken daily while the patient is sexually active, and then continued for two more days after sexual activity has stopped. For patients who initiate event-driven therapy more than once within a week, the loading dose should be reduced to one tablet, instead of two [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, this dosing strategy is not approved for use by the United States Food and Drug Administration, and its use in patients who have infrequent sex has not been clearly established. In addition, this regimen has not yet been evaluated in heterosexual men or women, and less than daily dosing regimens are not indicated for women who engage in vaginal sex since it can take longer to achieve protective levels of tenofovir in cervicovaginal tissues compared with rectal tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

As an example, in one trial, tenofovir gel reduced HIV transmission by almost 40 percent (CAPRISA 004) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]; however, the VOICE and FACTS 001 trial did not find any effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection/abstract/24,26,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26,35</a>]. The reasons for the contrasting results from these studies are not fully understood. However, timing of tenofovir gel application relative to sex and nonadherence appeared to affect the efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection/abstract/24-26,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26,36</a>]. Further work assessing the impact of the vaginal microbiome is also underway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. For the time being, topical application of tenofovir gel is not recommended for any female population. </p><p/><p>A vaginal ring using the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor has also been evaluated.

Among those assigned to dapivirine, the incidence of HIV infection was reduced by 27 percent (71 versus 97 infections; 95% CI 1-46). In addition, there was no difference in adverse events between the two groups.

In contrast, among the transgender women who had detectable levels of TDF, no HIV infections occurred.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3505534005\"><span class=\"h2\">Heterosexual men</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two large trials in Africa that included heterosexual men at high risk for sexual acquisition of HIV demonstrated that TDF-FTC can reduce the risk of HIV acquisition by approximately 80 percent compared with placebo. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Partners-PrEP</strong> &ndash; The Partners-PrEP trial was a randomized trial conducted among 4758 discordant couples in Kenya and Uganda, which demonstrated that TDF (with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emtricitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">emtricitabine</a>) reduced the risk of HIV acquisition compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. TDF and TDF-FTC use decreased the risk of HIV infection by 67 and 75 percent, respectively (17 and 13 infections compared with 52 infections in the placebo arm).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In this trial, over half of the patients were men. Among the male HIV-uninfected partners, the risk of infection was reduced 63 percent with TDF (9 of 984 men infected) and 84 percent with TDF-FTC (4 of 1010 infected) compared with placebo (24 of 959 infected) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>TDF2 </strong>&ndash; In the TDF2 trial, which evaluated 1200 sexually active heterosexual women and men in Botswana, the rate of HIV infection was decreased by 62 percent (95% CI 21.5-83.4) among patients randomly assigned to daily TDF-FTC compared with placebo (1.2 versus 3.1 events per 100 person-years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. A major limitation of this study was the high study noncompletion rate, which was approximately 33 percent in both arms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Similar to the Partners-PrEP trial, in men, the TDF2 trial demonstrated a risk reduction in HIV infection of 80 percent with tenofovir-emtricitabine (2 of 331 men infected) compared with placebo (10 of 331 infected) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2027975901\"><span class=\"h2\">Heterosexual women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among at-risk heterosexual women, trials of PrEP to prevent HIV acquisition with both oral and topical formulations of antiretrovirals have yielded variable results. All of these trials have been conducted in resource-limited settings. Studies evaluating topical formulations are discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H3014017372\" class=\"local\">'Alternative delivery systems'</a> above.)</p><p>Clinical trial data have raised questions about the efficacy of oral chemoprophylaxis for high-risk HIV-seronegative women who are sexually active. In some trials, TDF-FTC was found to have no effect on reducing transmission in women, whereas in others, transmission was reduced by approximately 70 percent. Possible explanations for these disparate findings include drug-drug interactions and differences in adherence. As an example, an adherence-based meta-analysis model in women found that with adherence levels of at least 75 percent, oral PrEP is estimated to be effective (relative risk 0.39, 95% CI 0.25-0.60) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. The efficacy of PrEP may also be different in women compared with MSM because of relatively lower concentrations of tenofovir in the cervicovaginal tissue compared with rectal tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection/abstract/34,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,62</a>]. </p><p>The conflicting trial results include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Partners-PrEP</strong> &ndash; Among the female HIV-negative partners in the Partners-PrEP trial described above, the risk of HIV infection was decreased by 71 percent with TDF (8 of 595 women infected) and 66 percent with TDF-FTC (9 of 566 infected) compared with placebo (28 of 619 infected) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The number of serious adverse events and pregnancies were similar among the three arms. Women who became pregnant had study medications discontinued; no pregnancy complications were observed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>TDF2 </strong>&ndash; There was also a trend towards 50 percent fewer infections with TDF-FTC prophylaxis compared with placebo among the 557 women in the TDF2 trial of at-risk heterosexual individuals in Botswana. However, the difference was not statistically significant in this subpopulation because of the relatively small sample size and modest HIV incidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>FEM-PrEP </strong>&ndash; In contrast, the FEM-PrEP trial, a randomized-controlled clinical trial that was conducted among approximately 2000 sexually active African women, was halted when an interim assessment found no evidence of protective efficacy among those assigned to the TDF-FTC arm (4.7 compared with 5 infections per 100 person-years with placebo) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection/abstract/29,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,63</a>]. In addition, women in the intervention arm had higher rates of pregnancy compared with those in the placebo arm, suggesting that they were engaging in more condomless intercourse. However, less than one quarter of the subset of FEM-PrEP participants who were assigned to receive TDF-FTC and underwent therapeutic drug monitoring had detectable plasma drug levels, suggesting a role of substantial nonadherence in the failure to demonstrate a protective effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>VOICE </strong>&ndash; Similar results were seen in another clinical trial (Vaginal and Oral Interventions to Control the Epidemic; VOICE trial), which was conducted among 5000 African women who were randomly assigned to oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tenofovir disoproxil fumarate</a> alone, oral TDF-FTC, placebo pill, or tenofovir or placebo vaginal gel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In this population of predominately young unmarried women with high HIV incidence, no study drug significantly reduced the risk of HIV acquisition. Tenofovir was detected in less than a third of blood samples from women, despite high levels of self-reported product use. A separate analysis suggested a protective effect among those that were adherent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H973955099\"><span class=\"h2\">Injection drug users</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a double-blind trial in Thailand, 2413 HIV-seronegative men and women with a history of injection drug use during the previous year were randomly assigned to once-daily therapy with tenofovir or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. All participants received HIV testing, individualized risk reduction, and adherence counseling; they were also offered condoms and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> treatment. In addition, participants chose either daily directly observed treatment (DOT) or monthly visits. The participants were followed for a mean of four years. The following results were reported: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fifty patients became infected during follow-up (17 in the intervention arm and 33 in the placebo group), which is consistent with a 49 percent reduction in the incidence of HIV with tenofovir (95% CI, 9.6-72.2).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injection drug use, needle sharing, and high-risk sexual behaviors decreased in both arms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No tenofovir-associated resistance mutations were detected among those who seroconverted and had genotype testing.</p><p/><p>A case-control analysis of those administered TDF evaluated whether drug levels correlated with a protective effect. Among those in the intervention arm, tenofovir was detected in 39 percent of the 13 HIV-positive participants and 67 percent of HIV-negative controls, which corresponds to a reduction in risk of HIV infection of 70 percent (95% CI 2.3-90.6) in participants with detectable concentrations of tenofovir. The protective benefits of PrEP were evident only after the first three years of follow-up, by which time there was a decrease in injection drug use and needle sharing. As such, it is not possible to make definitive conclusions about the efficacy of daily tenofovir on the prevention of parenteral transmission of HIV in isolation from a comprehensive prevention package and independent of its protective effect on decreasing sexual risk of HIV acquisition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1429471803\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect on HSV-2 transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of PrEP with TDF decreased the risk of herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) transmission, in addition to HIV transmission, in HIV serodiscordant heterosexuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>]. As an example, among 1044 HSV-2- and HIV-negative participants who had HSV-2- and HIV-infected partners, TDF (with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emtricitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">emtricitabine</a>) significantly reduced the incidence of HSV-2 seroconversion (9.6 versus 14.0 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p>However, this benefit was not seen in MSM.

Approximately 9 percent of participants acquired HSV-2. However, there was no difference in HSV-2 seroincidence among those receiving TDF-FTC compared with placebo (hazard ratio 1.1, 95% CI, 0.8-1.5). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7740894\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Up to two million new HIV infections occur annually worldwide.
