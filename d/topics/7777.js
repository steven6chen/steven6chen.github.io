Brain cancer happens when normal cells in the brain change into abnormal cells and grow out of control.</p><p>Brain cancers can be named after the type of cell they start from. GBM starts in the &quot;glial&quot; cells of the brain. Glial cells go between and around the brain's nerve cells.</p><p>As GBM grows, it can spread into healthy parts of the brain. It can also cause brain swelling. Both of these things can cause symptoms.</p><p>Most of the time, doctors don't know why a person gets a GBM. Getting radiation treatment earlier in life can raise a person's risk for GBM.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13776169\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of GBM?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headaches</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Memory or thinking problems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle weakness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vision changes, such as double vision or vision loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Language problems, such as trouble finding the right word for something</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Personality changes</p><p/><p>Other conditions can also cause these symptoms. But you should tell your doctor or nurse if any of these things happen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13776184\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The doctor will do an exam and order imaging tests, such as an MRI or a CT scan. Imaging tests create pictures of your brain. The pictures can show GBM or other abnormal growths. They can also show other kinds of changes that might be causing symptoms.</p><p>To tell if a person has GBM, doctors need to look at a sample of the tumor under the microscope. If the doctor thinks a brain tumor might be GBM, he or she usually does surgery to take out as much of the tumor as possible. Then, another doctor looks at a small sample of tumor tissue under a microscope. The sample can show if the tumor is GBM, a different type of brain tumor, or a sign of another brain condition.</p><p>Some people with GBM do not have surgery to remove the tumor. If the doctor does not do surgery, he or she might use a needle to take a small sample from the tumor. This can be done if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The GBM is in a part of the brain where surgery is too risky</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The GBM is too large for surgery to help</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The person is too sick for surgery</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13776201\"><span class=\"h1\">How is GBM treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment for GBM usually includes more than 1 of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; During surgery, doctors take out as much of the GBM as they can. This can help with symptoms and help people live longer. But surgery can hurt healthy areas of the brain. During surgery, doctors take out what they can without hurting healthy areas.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation therapy &ndash; Radiation kills some of the cancer cells. Most people with GBM have radiation therapy after surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy &ndash; Chemotherapy is the medical term for medicines that kill cancer cells or stop them from growing. Most people with GBM have chemotherapy at the same time as radiation and then for 6 months after stopping radiation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electric fields &ndash; A battery-powered device (called &quot;Optune&quot;) is another treatment option. The device goes directly on a shaved scalp, and gives off low-strength electric fields around the tumor. You will not be able to feel the electric fields. If you use this device, you will need to wear it for at least 18 hours a day.</p><p/><p>GBM can cause seizures and brain swelling. Doctors can give medicines or do surgery to treat these symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13776216\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment, you will have regular checkups to see if the GBM comes back. This includes having imaging tests (usually MRIs) of the brain.</p><p>You should watch for the common symptoms of GBM, and any other symptoms you had before your doctor found the GBM. Having symptoms could mean the GBM has come back. Tell your doctor or nurse about any symptoms you have.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13776233\"><span class=\"h1\">What if the GBM comes back?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most people, GBM comes back after treatment. If an imaging test shows changes in the brain after treatment, the changes could be caused by the GBM coming back, or they could be changes that happen in response to treatment. It can be hard to tell the difference between these changes. The doctor might do repeat imaging tests to see if the changes are cancer.</p><p>If GBM comes back or spreads, you might have more surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, or other treatments. You might need medicines to help treat swelling in the brain or seizures. Your doctor or nurse will talk with you about the best treatments for you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13776250\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I be in a clinical trial?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have GBM, you might want to be in a &quot;clinical trial.&quot; A clinical trial is a research study that tests new medicines and treatments to see how well they work.</p><p>Being in a clinical trial might or might not change your symptoms or help you live longer. But it can give doctors more information about GBM and how to treat it. Information from the study can help them create new and better medicines and treatments.</p><p>There are clinical trials for GBM all over the world. To find out more about being in a clinical trial, talk with your doctor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13776267\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should follow your doctor's instructions about checkups and tests. Talk to your doctor about any problems during treatment.</p><p>If GBM comes back, tell your doctors and nurses how you feel about the different treatments. Any time your doctor talks with you about a new treatment, ask:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the benefits of this treatment? Will it help me live longer? Will it reduce my symptoms or stop them?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What bad things could happen if I have this treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do I have other choices besides this treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happens if I do not have this treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13776284\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=brain-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Brain cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-are-clinical-trials-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What are clinical trials?
