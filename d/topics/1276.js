Unlike the primary TMA syndromes, these systemic disorders require therapy directed at the underlying disorder rather than specific therapy for the TMA. </p><p/><p>This topic review describes our initial approach to the child or adult with MAHA and thrombocytopenia for whom the etiology is uncertain. Details of the evaluation and management of specific, defined primary TMA syndromes including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) are presented in separate topic reviews on these syndromes.

Abnormalities in the microvasculature, including small arterioles and capillaries, are frequently involved. However, intravascular devices such as a prosthetic heart valve or assist devices may also cause MAHA. Characteristic laboratory data are a negative direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test (DAT), an increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), increased indirect bilirubin, and low haptoglobin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extracorpuscular-non-immune-hemolytic-anemia-fragmentation-hemolysis-and-hypersplenism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extracorpuscular non-immune hemolytic anemia: Fragmentation hemolysis and hypersplenism&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16672549\"><span class=\"h2\">Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Not all MAHA is caused by a TMA, but nearly all TMAs cause MAHA and thrombocytopenia. TMA describes a specific pathologic lesion in which abnormalities in the vessel wall of arterioles and capillaries lead to microvascular thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-ttp-hus-or-other-thrombotic-microangiopathy-tma/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. TMA is a pathologic diagnosis made by tissue biopsy. However, it is commonly inferred from the observation of MAHA and thrombocytopenia in the appropriate clinical setting. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H958404\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF PRIMARY TMA SYNDROMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary TMA syndromes are specific disorders with a probable cause that requires specific treatment; they include hereditary and acquired disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-ttp-hus-or-other-thrombotic-microangiopathy-tma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>With the exception of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP; TMA resulting from severe ADAMTS13 deficiency) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS; Shiga toxin-mediated TMA), we use names that indicate the underlying cause. The nomenclature may evolve further as pathophysiologic mechanisms are better understood. We do not use the term &quot;atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome (aHUS),&quot; because this term has no specificity. This term was used historically to describe children with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), thrombocytopenia, and renal failure not associated with diarrhea. The term has subsequently been adopted as a name for complement-mediated TMA, but it describes all patients with TMA who do not have severe ADAMTS13 deficiency or documented Shiga toxin. We also do not use the term &quot;idiopathic&quot; to describe any of the primary TMA syndromes. This term was used historically to imply ADAMTS13 deficiency in patients who did not have other recognized conditions that may cause TMA. The term &quot;idiopathic&quot; also has no specificity and should be avoided. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)</strong> &ndash; TTP is defined by a severe deficiency of ADAMTS13 (defined as activity &lt;10 percent), but the diagnosis of TTP remains based on clinical judgment since ADAMTS13 measures are often not available for several days and different methodologies may yield different results. Deficiency of ADAMTS13 can be hereditary (Upshaw-Shulman syndrome) or acquired, as a result of inhibition of ADAMTS13 activity by an autoantibody. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired TTP: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-thrombotic-thrombocytopenic-purpura-ttp\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">TTP is unique among the primary TMA syndromes for minimal abnormalities of kidney function, despite microthrombi observed throughout the kidney. TTP typically has more systemic manifestations of organ injury than the other primary TMA syndromes. In TTP, abnormalities of the central nervous system, heart, pancreas, thyroid, adrenal glands, intestinal mucosa, and other tissues may occur. The lungs are typically spared from ischemic injury in patients with TTP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-ttp-hus-or-other-thrombotic-microangiopathy-tma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Shiga toxin-mediated hemolytic uremic syndrome (ST-HUS)</strong> &ndash; Shiga toxins are produced by <em>Shigella dysenteriae</em> and some serotypes of <em>Escherichia coli</em>, such as O157:H7 and O104:H4. Shiga toxins cause direct damage to kidney epithelial cells (podocytes and tubular cells), kidney mesangial cells, and vascular endothelial cells. Although most cases are sporadic, large outbreaks related to sanitation issues regularly occur.

These disorders can be acute, caused by a toxic dose of an approved or illegal drug, or chronic, occurring after weeks or months of drug administration. Dose-dependent, toxicity-mediated DITMA is primarily caused by four classes of drugs: chemotherapeutic agents (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitomycin</a>), immunosuppressive agents (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a>), and narcotics taken inappropriately or illegal agents (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxymorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxymorphone</a> and cocaine).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some drugs (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a>) may cause DITMA by either immune-mediated or dose-dependent, toxicity-mediated mechanisms.

These syndromes appear to be exclusively hereditary due to mutations in the <em>MMACHC</em> gene (MethylMalonic ACiduria and Homocystinuria type C); however, patients may present with a TMA as an infant or adult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-ttp-hus-or-other-thrombotic-microangiopathy-tma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Elevated homocysteine and low methionine levels are seen in plasma, and urine may show methylmalonic aciduria. A dramatic case report described a previously healthy 18-year-old who presented with MAHA, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure who had negative testing for TTP and ST-HUS and was subsequently found to have cobalamin C deficiency due to a <em>MMACHC </em>mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-ttp-hus-or-other-thrombotic-microangiopathy-tma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

These syndromes differ from the abnormalities associated with hereditary thrombophilia, which cause thromboembolism in large vessels rather than systemic microvascular thrombosis. Mutations in genes encoding thrombomodulin (TM), plasminogen, and diacylglycerol kinase epsilon (<em>DGKE</em>) have been reported to be associated with TMA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-ttp-hus-or-other-thrombotic-microangiopathy-tma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p/><p>An article describing these syndromes from a hematologic perspective was published in 2017 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-ttp-hus-or-other-thrombotic-microangiopathy-tma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Additional details regarding the pathophysiology of individual TMA syndromes are presented separately.

Involvement of a clinician with expertise in these disorders (and their distinction from TTP and HUS) is important. Some of the more common and well-described conditions include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pregnancy complications</strong> &ndash; Preeclampsia with severe features and HELLP syndrome (<strong>h</strong>emolysis, <strong>e</strong>levated <strong>l</strong>iver enzymes, and <strong>l</strong>ow <strong>p</strong>latelets) are a continuum of pregnancy-related disorders. They characteristically cause microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) and thrombocytopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-ttp-hus-or-other-thrombotic-microangiopathy-tma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Also, women with systemic lupus erythematosus may experience a clinical &quot;flare&quot; during pregnancy. Distinguishing these disorders from TTP may be difficult because pregnancy may also trigger acute episodes of TTP, hereditary or acquired. Complement-mediated TMA may cause severe postpartum acute kidney injury. Diagnostic evaluation of pregnant patients and decisions regarding delivery are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thrombocytopenia-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thrombocytopenia in pregnancy&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Severe hypertension</strong> &ndash; Severe hypertension can cause MAHA and thrombocytopenia. Kidney injury may be present, but sometimes renal dysfunction is modest or absent. In patients with severe hypertension, control of the blood pressure is the most critical initial management and may be the only management required (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-hypertensive-emergencies-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of hypertensive emergencies in adults&quot;</a>). Severe hypertension can also cause the characteristic pathologic features of TMA in the kidneys. However, in some patients, chronic kidney disease related to a primary TMA syndrome may be the cause of the severe hypertension. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If possible, it is important to clarify the temporal relationship between the hematologic abnormalities and the hypertension. However, patients with severe renal dysfunction rarely have TTP, so the urgency of plasma exchange in this setting is less critical. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Systemic</strong> <strong>infections</strong> &ndash; Many systemic infections (bacterial, viral, rickettsial, and fungal) can cause MAHA and thrombocytopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-ttp-hus-or-other-thrombotic-microangiopathy-tma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

In some patients, these findings are caused by microvascular metastases without overt evidence of decompensated disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (while there is evidence of compensated DIC as manifested by elevated D-dimer). If there is any symptomatic suggestion of malignancy, such as persistent back pain, prominent pulmonary symptoms, or a past history of cancer, a thorough physical examination and other testing to evaluate for a systemic malignancy is imperative (eg, bone marrow evaluation, chest radiography).

Some systemic disorders, such as severe hypertension and <span class=\"nowrap\">preeclampsia/HELLP</span> syndrome, are obvious. However, systemic malignancies may not be initially apparent and may require other testing (eg, chest radiography, bone marrow examination) for diagnosis. Systemic infections should be obvious, but they may mimic all clinical features of TTP, and thus microbial testing may be required to identify an infectious organism. </p><p>Initiating plasma exchange (PEX) treatment for TTP is urgent. Therefore, the initial evaluation and management are balanced between the level of confidence in a TTP diagnosis versus the suspicion of another etiology for the MAHA and thrombocytopenia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F100722\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100722 \">table 2</a>). If the concern for the diagnosis of TTP is strong, then PEX may need to be initiated while the diagnostic evaluation continues. However, if the patient is not critically ill and the suspicion for the disorders discussed below is greater than the suspicion for TTP, then it may be appropriate to defer initiation of PEX while the patient evaluation continues.

There may be anuric acute kidney injury or normal kidney function. The key decision point in the evaluation for primary TMA syndromes is the confidence of the treating clinicians that TTP is the correct ultimate diagnosis. The rationale for focusing on this distinction is that TTP requires urgent intervention with plasma exchange (PEX; eg, within hours rather than days) to prevent serious or potentially life-threatening complications. Some patients with complement-mediated TMA, such as patients with postpartum acute kidney injury, may also require urgent anti-complement treatment to prevent irreversible kidney damage. The other primary TMAs generally are treated with supportive care, at least for the initial day or two (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F100723\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef100723 \">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p>Importantly, other disorders that are not primary TMAs may also require urgent interventions (eg, antibiotics for sepsis, delivery for severe preeclampsia), which provides the rationale for excluding these disorders as described above.

Young children can be affected by any of the primary TMA syndromes. However, children more commonly present with Shiga toxin-related hemolytic uremic syndrome (ST-HUS), complement-mediated TMA (hereditary or acquired), hereditary TTP, or hereditary metabolism-mediated or coagulation-mediated TMAs (eg, TMA due to genetic defects in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin B12</a> metabolism or diacylglycerol kinase epsilon [<em>DGKE</em>]).

Acute, immune-mediated, drug-induced TMA is distinct; it typically has an explosive onset of severe, systemic symptoms beginning within hours of drug exposure. In contrast, toxic, dose-dependent, drug-induced TMA may be associated with chronic kidney injury that develops over weeks or months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Kidney injury</strong> &ndash; All of the primary TMAs can be associated with kidney injury. However, the degree of injury may be a helpful distinguishing feature. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Minimal to no kidney injury</strong> &ndash; The absence of kidney injury, or the presence of only minimal kidney impairment, supports a diagnosis of hereditary or acquired TTP. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Sudden, severe kidney injury</strong> &ndash; Sudden onset acute kidney injury, especially when associated with anuria, supports immune-mediated DITMA or an acute dose-dependent, toxicity-mediated DITMA. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Onset of kidney injury over days</strong> &ndash; The gradual development of kidney injury following several days of abdominal pain and diarrhea is characteristic of ST-HUS, complement-mediated TMA, or metabolism-mediated or coagulation-mediated TMAs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Onset of kidney injury over weeks to months</strong> &ndash; Very gradual onset of kidney injury may be seen in patients with DITMA caused by toxic chemotherapeutic or immunosuppressive drugs.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16673527\"><span class=\"h2\">Features of individual primary TMAs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some cases, additional aspects of the history or specific physical findings may suggest a specific primary TMA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F100722\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100722 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>TTP</strong> &ndash; There are no specific clinical features that distinguish TTP. Most patients present with several days of nonspecific symptoms, such as progressive weakness, fatigue, purpura, and gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, nausea, diarrhea). However, some patients have minimal symptoms and TTP is suspected only when anemia and thrombocytopenia are discovered. Approximately one-third of patients have no neurologic symptoms; one-third may have nonspecific symptoms, such as confusion and headache; and one-third will have more severe neurologic symptoms, such as transient focal neurologic abnormalities, aphasia, diplopia, or weakness, clumsiness, and numbness of an arm or hand. In many cases, the focal symptoms occur transiently. Patients with TTP often have minor purpura related to severe thrombocytopenia; they rarely have overt bleeding. Fever is uncommon; high fever with shaking chills rarely occurs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired TTP: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>ST-HUS</strong> &ndash; Patients often have a history of exposure to farm animals, under-cooked meat, or contaminated water; typically this occurs several days before the onset of symptoms. Outbreaks of ST-HUS are highly publicized, but most cases are sporadic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-ttp-hus-or-other-thrombotic-microangiopathy-tma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Presenting symptoms include severe abdominal pain with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. An acute abdominal surgical disorder, such as appendicitis, is often initially suspected. The diarrhea typically becomes overtly bloody; in older adults, ischemic colitis is then often suspected. Kidney injury, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia occur several days after the onset of abdominal pain and diarrhea, when the initial symptoms begin to resolve.

A preceding infection including a diarrheal illness may be present in up to 80 percent of children and 50 percent of adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-ttp-hus-or-other-thrombotic-microangiopathy-tma/abstract/5,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,22</a>]. Symptoms include pallor, general malaise, and poor appetite. Edema may be present. Upon clinical evaluation, hypertension and laboratory values suggesting renal compromise are often present. Extra-renal manifestations are observed in up to 20 percent and include central nervous system (CNS) manifestations (the most common extra-renal finding), cardiac ischemic events, pulmonary hemorrhage and failure, pancreatitis, hepatic cytolysis, and intestinal bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-ttp-hus-or-other-thrombotic-microangiopathy-tma/abstract/5,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,22</a>].

These symptoms are often attributed to an infectious illness. The patient may notice that they have been anuric since the onset of symptoms; this may be attributed to dehydration. When a drug-induced etiology is suspected, potentially causative drugs are those that have been taken daily for less than two to three weeks or those taken intermittently over many years. Quinine is the most common etiology; documenting quinine exposure requires explicit questions. Patients may have taken quinine tablets, tonic water, or bitter lemon only occasionally, and they may assume that this is not important. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with some toxic, dose-related DITMA may also have sudden onset of symptoms. An example is the intravenous injection of Opana ER (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxymorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxymorphone</a> extended release, intended for oral use). The history of illegal drug use or intravenous drug abuse may be difficult to obtain. For other drugs (eg, chemotherapy medications, calcineurin inhibitors), the onset is chronic and there are no symptoms other than the gradual onset of weakness, fatigue, and symptoms related to hypertension over weeks or months. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-induced-thrombotic-microangiopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug-induced thrombotic microangiopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Metabolism, coagulation-mediated TMAs</strong> &ndash; Hereditary metabolism-mediated or coagulation-mediated TMAs typically occur in infants but can occur in adults; these disorders do not have specific presenting symptoms. Patients may describe symptoms related to progressive kidney failure, such as weakness and fatigue. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16673539\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory evaluation</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9914664\"><span class=\"h3\">All patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The important laboratory tests that must be performed for all patients (and repeated daily) include a complete blood count (CBC) with platelet count, to assess the degree of anemia and thrombocytopenia; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), to follow the intensity of hemolysis or organ injury; and serum creatinine, to follow the severity and progression of renal dysfunction. For patients with kidney injury, the daily urine output should also be monitored. </p><p>All patients with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) and thrombocytopenia without an obvious systemic illness responsible for these findings should have measurement of ADAMTS13 activity to assess the possibility of TTP (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H22954124\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired TTP: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic testing'</a>). This is especially important in individuals with minimal or no renal function abnormalities, a common finding in TTP. The only exception is a patient with findings that are highly suggestive of another primary TMA (eg, diarrheal illness in a young child in the midst of an ST-HUS outbreak). </p><p>However, results of ADAMTS13 activity measurements may take several days, and patients with a clinical diagnosis of TTP require urgent therapy with PEX. Thus, individuals without another obvious primary TMA usually require presumptive treatment for TTP with PEX while awaiting the results of ADAMTS13 activity measurements. If PEX was already initiated, ADAMTS13 activity can be measured on a specimen obtained after PEX was started, because severe deficiency may persist for one or more days of PEX. These issues are discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-ttp-initial-treatment#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired TTP: Initial treatment&quot;, section on 'Initiation of PEX for a presumptive diagnosis of TTP'</a>.)</p><p>Despite the central role of severe ADAMTS13 deficiency in the pathophysiology of TTP, diagnosis of TTP remains a clinical diagnosis supported by the results of this testing, and the ADAMTS13 activity level cannot be used in isolation to make the diagnosis of TTP. The rationale is based on disease and laboratory issues. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Disease issues</strong> &ndash; In general, the finding of severe ADAMTS13 deficiency (activity &lt;10 percent) is consistent with the diagnosis of TTP, and individuals with normal or moderately low activity (eg, &ge;10 percent) should have additional evaluation for the alternate causes of their symptoms. However, in some cases, systemic disorders such as infection or malignancy may cause marked reductions in ADAMTS13 activity in the absence of TTP, and in some cases, individuals with TTP may have ADAMTS13 activity levels above the 10 percent cutoff, perhaps related to previous transfusions. Thus, the ultimate diagnosis of TTP or another condition remains a clinical decision and cannot be based solely on ADAMTS13 activity. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Laboratory issues</strong> &ndash; Laboratory testing for ADAMTS13 activity is useful for distinguishing TTP from other TMA syndromes, but the diagnostic accuracy remains imperfect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-ttp-hus-or-other-thrombotic-microangiopathy-tma/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].

Rarely, a biopsy that was done to evaluate renal disease may reveal an unsuspected TMA that has not caused MAHA or thrombocytopenia.

Among the primary TMA syndromes, TTP is the disorder with the greatest acute mortality; as high as 90 percent in the era before PEX was used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-ttp-hus-or-other-thrombotic-microangiopathy-tma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Therefore, the decision regarding whether to initiate urgent PEX must balance the confidence in the diagnosis of TTP against the risks of PEX treatment, which include a high frequency of major complications such as central venous catheter-associated hemorrhage, infections, or thrombosis; and plasma-associated transfusion reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-ttp-hus-or-other-thrombotic-microangiopathy-tma/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

This is a common presentation of TTP.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If there is a history consistent with a drug-induced TMA (DITMA; eg, abrupt onset of nausea and anuria hours after a quinine-containing beverage, or after intravenous drug use, or if there is the gradual development of hypertension and kidney failure after several weeks or longer of treatment with a calcineurin inhibitor or chemotherapy), it may be possible to avoid PEX. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following delivery in a pregnant patient, if there is rapid development of acute kidney injury with anticipated need for dialysis, postpartum complement-mediated TMA is likely; anti-complement treatment should occur promptly, without PEX. Testing for abnormalities of complement regulation is unaffected by this therapy. (See <a href=\"#H9914690\" class=\"local\">'Role of complement testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>In some patients, initiation of PEX may require transfer to another hospital. In these patients, or in patients for whom there is delay in insertion of the central venous catheter required for PEX, plasma infusion may be effective as a temporizing measure. However, plasma infusion is not an appropriate substitute for PEX. When PEX is begun for a diagnosis of TTP, glucocorticoids are also administered routinely. These issues, and additional details related to the use of PEX for TTP, are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-ttp-initial-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired TTP: Initial treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In rare patients who have severe, anaphylactic reactions to plasma, a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=factor-viii-human-plasma-derived-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">factor VIII concentrate</a> that contains a high concentration of ADAMTS13 can be used together with plasma removal by apheresis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-ttp-hus-or-other-thrombotic-microangiopathy-tma/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].

Our practice is to stop PEX after the patient has had a normal platelet count for two days (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-ttp-initial-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired TTP: Initial treatment&quot;</a>). However, exacerbations, defined by a decreasing platelet count when PEX is stopped, may occur, usually within the first week. This issue is discussed in detail separately.

When complement-mediated TMA is suspected, anti-complement therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eculizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eculizumab</a>) should be started as soon as possible (preferably, within 24 to 48 hours). The goal is to limit irreversible renal injury. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Children</strong> &ndash; It is reasonable to begin complement therapy as first-line therapy in children with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), thrombocytopenia, and renal failure who do not have bloody diarrhea (which is suggestive of ST-HUS) and who lack any other apparent alternative diagnosis. The rationale includes the effectiveness of anti-complement therapy if the diagnosis is correct, and the avoidance of risks associated with other therapies (eg, catheter-related complications and transfusion reactions associated with PEX). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-ttp-initial-treatment#H3711878\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired TTP: Initial treatment&quot;, section on 'PEX complications'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Postpartum women</strong> &ndash; Complement-mediated TMA must be considered in postpartum women with MAHA, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure. The risk for end-stage renal disease is high in this setting, and therefore it is reasonable to begin anti-complement therapy urgently in order to limit preventable renal damage while the diagnosis is being confirmed (or eliminated). </p><p/><p>In contrast, in other (non-pregnant) adults with MAHA, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure for whom the diagnosis is unclear, we generally initiate PEX rather than anti-complement therapy (see <a href=\"#H16673829\" class=\"local\">'Plasma exchange (PEX)'</a> above). If subsequent testing does not reveal a specific primary TMA diagnosis or evidence of a systemic disorder associated with MAHA and thrombocytopenia, management is individualized. PEX may be discontinued and a decision made regarding the use of anti-complement therapy. </p><p>Importantly, if anti-complement therapy is deemed to be appropriate, acute treatment should not be delayed while awaiting the results of serologic testing or molecular (genetic) studies for abnormalities of complement regulation. However, treatment with anti-complement therapy should be stopped if laboratory results <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the clinical scenario shift to favoring an alternative diagnosis. &#160;</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=eculizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Eculizumab</a> is generally well-tolerated. Eculizumab is removed by PEX and diluted by plasma infusion; thus, if these therapies are used concomitantly, additional doses of eculizumab may be required. There is increased risk for meningococcal infection, and therefore meningococcal vaccine is required prior to starting eculizumab. The vaccine decreases but does not eliminate the risk of meningococcal infection. Patients are given antibiotics during the two-week period before vaccination becomes effective. Some clinicians suggest that prophylactic antibiotics should be continued as long as eculizumab is continued.
