Clinical syndromes related to this parasite include neurocysticercosis (NCC) and extraneural cysticercosis. NCC, in turn, is divided into parenchymal and extraparenchymal forms. Extraparenchymal forms include intraventricular, subarachnoid, spinal, and ocular disease.</p><p>Guidelines on diagnosis and treatment of NCC were published in 2018 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The natural history, clinical features, and diagnosis of cysticercosis will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, life cycle, transmission, and treatment of cysticercosis are discussed separately.

This stage typically persists for many years. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cysticercosis-epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cysticercosis: Epidemiology, transmission, and prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>A number of mechanisms for parasite evasion of the host immune response have been postulated. The parasite elaborates a variety of substances that may interfere with lymphocyte proliferation and macrophage function, thereby inhibiting normal cellular immune defenses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. In addition, humoral antibodies are not capable of killing the parasite.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cysticerci eventually degenerate, likely because they lose their ability to evade the host immune response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Radiographic appearance of contrast enhancement <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> edema reflects the activity of the host immune response against the parasite. In the setting of enhancing intraparenchymal lesions, the inflammatory response is frequently associated with seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultimately, the cysticerci resolve or become nonviable calcified granulomas; presence of intraparenchymal brain calcifications is also associated with seizures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The mechanism of seizures associated with calcified lesions is unclear; seizures may result from inflammation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> from intermittent antigen release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Alternatively, changes in brain plasticity and scarring may result in epileptogenic foci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p/><p>Cysticerci may occur simultaneously in more than one anatomic site. In addition, cysticerci at different stages in their natural history may be present simultaneously; for example, at any one time, a patient may have some viable cysts, some enhancing cysts, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> some calcified cysts.</p><p>In India and the United States, most patients with neurocysticercosis (NCC) present with a single enhancing lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,3,11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,11-13</a>]. In endemic areas of Latin America, most patients have one or more calcified lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. Among hospitalized patients in Latin America, the most common presentation is multiple viable cysticerci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,3,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,13</a>].</p><p>Clinical manifestations of NCC depend upon whether the cysticerci are localized to the brain parenchyma, the extraparenchymal tissues, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In general, intraparenchymal cysticerci are associated with seizures <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> headache. Extraparenchymal cysticerci are associated with symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure (eg, headache, nausea, and vomiting) and may be accompanied by altered mental status. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Intraparenchymal neurocysticercosis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Extraparenchymal neurocysticercosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Extraneural cysticercosis may involve a range of tissues; the most common forms include muscle or subcutaneous tissue involvement. (See <a href=\"#H2743675890\" class=\"local\">'Extraneural cysticercosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Intraparenchymal neurocysticercosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intraparenchymal NCC is the most common form of cysticercosis; it occurs in &gt;60 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,11-13,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,11-13,17</a>]. Onset of symptomatic parenchymal NCC usually occurs three to five years following infection but can occur &gt;30 years following infection; in patients with delayed presentation, presence of nonviable (calcified) lesions is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/12,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,18,19</a>].</p><p>The clinical manifestations of parenchymal NCC depend on the number and location of cysticerci and the degree of associated inflammatory response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,4,13,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,13,20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizures are the most common clinical manifestation of parenchymal NCC; they are usually focal and may be associated with secondary generalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,4,11,12,21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,11,12,21-23</a>]. Seizures may occur in the setting of cyst degeneration (associated with enhancement on radiographic imaging) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> in the setting of nonviable cysticerci (associated with calcification on radiographic imaging). In many endemic countries, NCC is the most common cause of adult-onset seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,4,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,20,21</a>]. Headaches are also frequent, but headache alone does not typically prompt patients with NCC to seek medical attention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less common manifestations of parenchymal NCC include altered vision, focal neurologic signs, and meningitis. Fever is typically absent. In the absence of mass effect or stroke, neurologic examination usually does not demonstrate focal signs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with massive numbers of parenchymal cysticerci, an intense immune response with diffuse brain edema can cause a clinical picture resembling encephalitis; clinical manifestations may include seizures, headache, nausea and vomiting, impaired consciousness, reduced visual acuity, and occasionally fever. Cysticercal encephalitis is a rare form of NCC that typically presents in children and young women. Cysticercal encephalitis can occur spontaneously or can be provoked by antiparasitic therapy (which causes a large number of cysticerci to degenerate simultaneously).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many cases of parenchymal NCC are asymptomatic and are identified incidentally via radiographic imaging performed for other reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14,15,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15,24</a>].</p><p/><p>The prognosis of parenchymal NCC varies with the number of cysticerci and degree of inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Patients with single enhancing lesions have a more favorable prognosis than those with multiple viable cysticerci.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Extraparenchymal neurocysticercosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extraparenchymal NCC can occur in the ventricles, the subarachnoid space, the spine, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the eye; these presentations occur more commonly in adults than in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,4,17,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,17,25</a>]. Extraparenchymal NCC can coexist with intraparenchymal disease.</p><p>Extraparenchymal cysticerci are associated with symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure (eg, headache, nausea, and vomiting) and may be accompanied by altered mental status. In general, extraparenchymal NCC carries a higher risk for complication or death than parenchymal NCC.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Intraventricular lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intraventricular cysticerci (free-floating cysts in the ventricular cavity or attached to the choroid plexus) occur in 10 to 20 percent of cases.</p><p>Typically, symptoms develop when cysticerci become lodged in the ventricular outflow tracks, with consequent obstructive hydrocephalus and increased intracranial pressure (gradual or acute onset) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,4,12,13,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,12,13,25</a>]. Associated symptoms include headache, nausea and vomiting, altered mental status, and decreased visual acuity with papilledema. Less frequent symptoms include seizures and focal neurologic signs.</p><p>Occasionally, mobile cysts in the third or fourth ventricle can cause intermittent obstruction, leading to episodes of sudden loss of consciousness related to head movements (Bruns' syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Subarachnoid lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Subarachnoid neurocysticercosis (SAN) in the basilar cisterns is the most severe form of NCC; it occurs in about 5 percent of hospitalized cases. SAN may be associated with chronic arachnoiditis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mass effect due to cyst enlargement. In addition, there is a strong association between SAN and involvement of the spinal subarachnoid space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Spinal lesions'</a> below.)</p><p>Chronic arachnoiditis may develop as a result of local inflammation; in some cases, it may be associated with communicating hydrocephalus, vasculitis, meningitis, and stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,12,13,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12,13,28</a>]. The radiographic appearance is similar to other causes of basilar meningitis, unless cysticerci are visible. Obstructive hydrocephalus can occur in the setting of secondary occlusion of the foramina of Luschka or Magendie. In addition, meningeal inflammation and leptomeningeal thickening at the base of the brain can lead to visual field defects and cranial nerve palsies due to entrapment of the cranial nerves arising from the brainstem. Vascular involvement can lead to proliferative angiitis and vascular obstruction with secondary cerebral infarcts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,28-30</a>]. Focal neurologic motor signs, ataxia, and sensory dysfunction can ensue.</p><p>Mass effect and focal neurologic defects can develop in patients whose cysticerci enlarge within in the subarachnoid space, where cysts may grow to 10 cm or larger. This is commonly observed with cysticerci in the sylvian fissure, where cyst growth is not limited by pressure from the brain parenchyma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Spinal lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spinal cord involvement occurs in approximately 1 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p>Spinal cysticerci are usually located in the subarachnoid space where they can cause inflammatory and demyelinating changes in the peripheral nerve roots. Patients typically present with radicular pain, paresthesias <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sphincter disturbances. Neurological deficits vary with the location of the lesion and may be clinically indistinguishable from other spinal cord lesions. There is a strong association between spinal subarachnoid cysticerci and basal subarachnoid involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Subarachnoid lesions'</a> above.)</p><p>Less commonly, intramedullary cysticercosis can occur and may be associated with transverse myelitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Ocular lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ocular cysticercosis occurs in approximately 1 to 3 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p>Patients with ocular cysticercosis may have involvement of the subretinal space, vitreous humor, anterior chamber, conjunctiva, or extraocular muscles. Presence of subretinal cysticerci reflects neurocysticercosis; presence of cysticerci in the anterior chamber of the eye reflects extraneural cysticercosis.</p><p>Symptoms may include impaired vision, recurrent eye pain, and diplopia. Inflammation around degenerating cysticerci can threaten vision by causing chorioretinitis, retinal detachment, or vasculitis. However, many patients are asymptomatic.</p><p>Ocular cysticercosis should be excluded by an ophthalmologic examination in all patients with NCC prior to initiating antiparasitic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Clinical syndromes include neurocysticercosis (NCC) and extraneural cysticercosis. NCC is divided into parenchymal and extraparenchymal forms. Stages of cysticercosis include an initial (viable) phase, a degenerating (enhancing) phase, and a nonviable (calcified) phase (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F117224\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef117224 \">table 1</a>). Cysticerci may be present in more than one anatomic site, and cysticerci at different stages in their natural history may be present simultaneously. (See <a href=\"#H3414484516\" class=\"local\">'Overview and disease phases'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intraparenchymal NCC is the most common form of cysticercosis; it occurs in &gt;60 percent of cases. Onset of symptoms usually occurs three to five years following infection but can occur &gt;30 years following infection. Seizures are the most common manifestation; less common manifestations include altered vision, focal neurologic signs, and meningitis. In patients with massive numbers of parenchymal cysts, an intense immune response with diffuse edema can cause a clinical picture resembling encephalitis; manifestations may include seizures, headache, nausea and vomiting, impaired consciousness, reduced visual acuity, and occasionally fever. Many cases of parenchymal NCC are asymptomatic and are identified incidentally via radiographic imaging performed for other reasons. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Intraparenchymal neurocysticercosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intraventricular NCC (free-floating cysts in the ventricular cavity or attached to the choroid plexus) occurs in 10 to 20 percent of cases. Typically, symptoms develop when cysticerci become lodged in the ventricular outflow tracks, with consequent obstructive hydrocephalus and increased intracranial pressure. Associated symptoms include headache, nausea and vomiting, altered mental status, and decreased visual acuity with papilledema. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Intraventricular lesions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subarachnoid neurocysticercosis is the most severe form of NCC; it occurs in about 5 percent of hospitalized cases. Subarachnoid NCC may be associated with chronic arachnoiditis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mass effect due to cyst enlargement. Chronic arachnoiditis may develop as a result of local inflammation; in some cases, it may be associated with communicating hydrocephalus, vasculitis, meningitis, and stroke. Mass effect and focal neurologic defects can develop in patients whose cysticerci enlarge within in the subarachnoid space, where cysts may grow to 10 cm or larger. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Subarachnoid lesions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other clinical presentations of NCC include spinal lesions (1 percent of cases) and ocular lesions (1 to 3 percent of cases). Spinal cysticerci are usually located in the subarachnoid space where they can cause inflammatory and demyelinating changes in the peripheral nerve roots. Patients typically present with radicular pain, paresthesias, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sphincter disturbances. Patients with ocular cysticercosis may have involvement of the subretinal space, vitreous humor, anterior chamber, conjunctiva, or extraocular muscles. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Spinal lesions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Ocular lesions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extraneural cysticercosis may present with muscle or subcutaneous tissue involvement; these manifestations are usually asymptomatic but may cause discomfort when inflamed. Intramuscular cysts often undergo calcification and may be detected radiographically as &quot;cigar-shaped calcifications.&quot; (See <a href=\"#H2743675890\" class=\"local\">'Extraneural cysticercosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of cysticercosis should be suspected in patients with seizures <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> manifestations of elevated intracranial pressure and relevant neuroimaging findings (such as cystic lesions, enhancing lesions, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> calcifications), in the setting of relevant epidemiologic exposure (ingestion of <em>T. solium</em> eggs shed in the stool of a tapeworm carrier either in association with exposure in an endemic area or household exposure to an asymptomatic carrier).

(See <a href=\"#H311769557\" class=\"local\">'Clinical approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with suspected NCC should be evaluated with computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. CT is useful for identifying calcifications and parenchymal cysticerci. MRI is useful for detecting relatively small lesions, evaluating degenerative changes, detecting edema around calcified lesions, and visualizing scolices within calcified lesions. (See <a href=\"#H440731905\" class=\"local\">'Modalities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiographic manifestations of intraparenchymal NCC are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F117224\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef117224 \">table 1</a>). Viable cysts are round, nonenhancing hypodense lesions usually 5 to 20 mm in diameter. As the cyst begins to degenerate, the cyst wall increases in density and is often accompanied by edema or contrast enhancement. Following collapse of the cyst, a residual calcified granuloma may be present; calcifications are usually solid, nodular lesions 2 to 4 mm in diameter (range 1 to 10 mm). Identification of a scolex (the anterior end of the tapeworm with suckers and hooks for attachment) within a cystic lesion is a pathognomonic radiographic finding. Scolices appear as rounded or elongated bright nodules (2 to 4 mm in diameter) within the cyst cavity. (See <a href=\"#H1509102306\" class=\"local\">'Findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serologic testing should be performed for confirmatory evaluation in patients with suspected cysticercosis. Such results are most useful for patients with neuroimaging findings that are consistent with NCC but not diagnostic. Patients with diagnostic neuroimaging findings warrant treatment before serologic results are available.
