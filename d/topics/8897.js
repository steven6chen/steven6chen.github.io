In order for consent to be valid, the patient must be competent. In the setting of informed consent, competence or capacity means the patient has the mental ability to understand problems and make decisions about accepting or rejecting medical treatments that are offered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/informed-procedural-consent/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Competence is always presumed unless there are obvious clinical (eg, severe mental illness) or judicial (eg, a determination of incompetence at a competency hearing) reasons to doubt competency. If a patient is deemed incompetent by a court of law, the duty of informed consent extends to the patient's proxy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In instances of temporarily diminished capacity, a physician is obligated to reassess capacity to consent over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/informed-procedural-consent/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p/><p>In order to meet the requirements for effective, informed decision making, a physician must disclose material facts as well as appropriate additional disclosures.

There are no hard and fast rules about percentages of risk or degrees of harm that require discussion. However, the applicable standards may vary from one patient or jurisdiction to another. As an example, in Texas, state regulations delineate specific risks or hazards associated with certain procedures that must be disclosed in each instance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/informed-procedural-consent/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H16860353\" class=\"local\">'The duty to inform'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3316516\"><span class=\"h2\">Physician disclosure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physicians must answer truthfully if a patient asks questions about the number of similar procedures performed and their success rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/informed-procedural-consent/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Failure to answer honestly may leave a physician open to claims of fraud and misrepresentation, as well as negligent nondisclosure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/informed-procedural-consent/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>The law mandates disclosure of a physician's financial conflict(s) of interest, since the law presumes that there is the potential for undue influence on that physician's medical judgment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/informed-procedural-consent/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Examples include referral to a laboratory, an ambulatory surgery center, or a radiology service in which the physician has ownership. Patients must be given the opportunity to seek care in an independent facility. There may also be disclosure requirements if the physician has a commercial interest in the use of a patient's cells or in the use of new devices or techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/informed-procedural-consent/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Patients are not entitled to know everything about a provider's personal attributes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/informed-procedural-consent/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, some courts have mandated disclosure of a physician's own alcohol abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/informed-procedural-consent/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] and HIV status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/informed-procedural-consent/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Other courts refuse to mandate voluntary disclosure, concluding that those physician-specific facts are not material, and that it is an unwarranted invasion of the physician's privacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/informed-procedural-consent/abstract/14,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19730393\"><span class=\"h2\">Personnel</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physician must advise patients of personnel and their respective roles, including residents, students, and equipment representatives. It is particularly important for patients to know if residents or students will be performing segments of a procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/informed-procedural-consent/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. It is generally not necessary to name residents or students individually on the consent form, as a generic reference to &quot;residents&quot; and &quot;students&quot; will typically suffice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/informed-procedural-consent/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Some patients object to having part or all of their procedure or operation done by others than the physician they originally chose. Patients retain the right to refuse participation by residents and students. Physicians also have the right to refuse to take care of patients who will not allow residents to participate in procedures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3316932\"><span class=\"h2\">Additional procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is prudent for the physician to inform patients of any additional procedures that may be necessary for a successful outcome or that are recommended to prevent future health problems. Examples might include en bloc resection of adjacent structures in a cancer operation or a protective colostomy or ileostomy for a low anterior anastomosis. In such cases, preoperative discussion about the stoma, preoperative marking for a potential stoma site, and counseling with the stomal therapist may help the patient prepare for the procedure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=routine-care-of-patients-with-an-ileostomy-or-colostomy-and-management-of-ostomy-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Routine care of patients with an ileostomy or colostomy and management of ostomy complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3315520\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physician can maximize the effectiveness of an informed consent session by communicating in terms patients and their families can understand. Important elements of effective communication are discussed in the following sections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3315527\"><span class=\"h2\">Focus on the patient</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The legal principles of informed consent promote patient autonomy, the notion that patients should decide who touches them and how that contact is made. Thus, the physician should be wary of too much pressure, too little information, or too little attention to the patient's need for information, understanding, and comfort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/informed-procedural-consent/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. As Supreme Court Justice Benjamin Cardozo once wrote, &quot;Every human being of adult years and sound mind has a right to determine what shall be done with his body&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/informed-procedural-consent/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Physicians must focus on the patient's understanding and consent. Including relatives in the discussion may be good practice when patients allow them to join the conversation, but decisions made by family members can never countermand those of a competent adult patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/informed-procedural-consent/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=a-patient-centered-view-of-the-clinician-patient-relationship\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;A patient-centered view of the clinician-patient relationship&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3316955\"><span class=\"h2\">Comprehensible language</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The language used to obtain consent must be comprehensible to the patient and cannot be a simple list. In order to protect themselves from such uncertainty, some physicians give patients exhaustive lists of every conceivable thing that might go wrong. However, the transmission of important information requires more than an impersonal, boiler-plate listing of minutiae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/informed-procedural-consent/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Rather, personal transmission of truly relevant data should be accomplished. The physician should present the information that someone in the patient's situation needs to know in order to make a truly educated decision (&quot;If I were in this patient's shoes, what would I want to know?&quot;). (See <a href=\"#H3315269\" class=\"local\">'Material facts'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3315534\"><span class=\"h3\">Educational material</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Literature or other teaching tools that are targeted to lay readers, such as patient pamphlets or videos, can improve communication and patient understanding of planned procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/informed-procedural-consent/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. A systematic review that included 115 studies involving more than 33,000 patients found that patients provided with educational material have a more accurate perception of procedural risks, a reduced level of decisional conflict, and a more active role in decision making [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/informed-procedural-consent/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3315541\"><span class=\"h3\">Interpreters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interpreters are necessary for non-English speakers, and a translator skilled in medical terminology is ideal for the purpose of transmitting accurate information. Translation should not be left to family members, as they may withhold information from a patient in order to protect him or her from hearing bad news. In such cases, incomplete or misleading information may be all the patient receives, and the physician will not realize that information was not effectively or completely communicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/informed-procedural-consent/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p>The Joint Commission defines health literacy as &quot;the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/informed-procedural-consent/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The educational, social, and cultural factors that influence the expectations and preferences of the individual must also be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/informed-procedural-consent/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Thus, if additional clarification and explanation is needed, the conversation must be expanded, and it must be tailored to the individual needs of the patient. In the end, the patient has to hear, understand, and agree to the proposed procedure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cross-cultural-care-and-communication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cross-cultural care and communication&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3315548\"><span class=\"h2\">Emergency situations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In emergency situations or when the patient is sick or in pain, the patient may be less capable of receiving, interpreting, or communicating information. The medical facts must be explained carefully and deliberately to the patient and to family members or others invited into the discussion by the patient, as the urgency of the situation allows.</p><p>In some cases, the need for consent may be outweighed by the need for urgent intervention and the physician proceeds as expeditiously as the situation requires [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/informed-procedural-consent/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. If at all possible, family members should be contacted if they are not present. When available, living wills and durable powers of attorney should be consulted.</p><p>The duty of informed consent extends to a patient's proxy or surrogate decision maker. If a patient regains capacity, the duty of informed consent returns to the patient and the role of the proxy in informed decision making is extinguished. This is why reassessment of the patient's capacity is essential. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethics-in-the-intensive-care-unit-informed-consent\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ethics in the intensive care unit: Informed consent&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3315555\"><span class=\"h2\">Comatose or incompetent patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Incompetent patients are patients who lack adequate decision-making capacity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/informed-procedural-consent/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Physicians must assess all such patients for capacity regardless of their current (or presumed) incompetence. It may be necessary to seek psychiatric consultation if there is doubt about the patient's capacity.

Thus, a physician must document the content of informed consent sessions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The informed consent discussion and its documentation should be done by the physician who will be performing the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/informed-procedural-consent/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. Delegating the responsibility to obtain consent to someone else does <strong>not</strong> absolve the physician of liability if that consent session is incomplete or ineffective. In some jurisdictions the duty to have that informed consent discussion simply cannot be delegated to anyone other than the surgeon <span class=\"nowrap\">himself/herself</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/informed-procedural-consent/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The physician should date and time the written summary of what was said and to whom, making note of relatives, friends, or support staff such as nurses or interpreters who are present. All elements of the discussion should be reduced to writing: diagnosis, proposed treatment with its risks and benefits, and alternative treatments with their risks and benefits.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is not sufficient to state that &quot;the risks and benefits were discussed&quot; without further description of the specifics. The physician should document that the patient understood the concepts as discussed and agreed to proceed. In addition, the physician should document that the patient was provided with appropriate literature, the patient had the opportunity to ask questions, and that those questions were answered. The standard procedure consent document means little, particularly in its generic form. The real work of obtaining informed consent is documented in office or hospital notes. There is generally no need for a witness to the one-on-one discussion in the office or at the bedside.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On the other hand, the consent form itself is often generated by the facility in which the proposed procedure is to take place, and the signing of that form is generally witnessed by a member of the staff at the facility.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Documentation is particularly important when patients refuse intervention.

There are two legal theories of recovery for failure to obtain informed consent: battery action and negligent nondisclosure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8537352\"><span class=\"h2\">Battery action</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A battery action is an action for a &quot;touching&quot; to which the patient did not agree [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/informed-procedural-consent/abstract/19,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,40</a>]. In some jurisdictions, inadequate disclosure of risks adds up to no consent at all, and thus a claim of battery may be made, even if the procedure is technically successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/informed-procedural-consent/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The rationale in such cases is that a poorly informed patient cannot legally consent in any meaningful way, and thus any nominal agreement is void [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/informed-procedural-consent/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Battery actions are infrequent in the medical arena, and, in most jurisdictions, the typical case in which a plaintiff asserts an absence of informed consent is termed &quot;negligent nondisclosure&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/informed-procedural-consent/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Usually, the patient says he or she did sign the consent form, but was not thoroughly and comprehensibly made aware of the nature of the proposed procedure and its risks. This claim is sometimes made by itself but is more commonly appended to the standard medical malpractice claim that the physician did not perform the procedure according to industry standards.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8537359\"><span class=\"h2\">Negligent nondisclosure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Negligent nondisclosure cases are typical negligence cases, and as such, there are four elements that must be shown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/informed-procedural-consent/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duty &ndash; The duty is the requirement that a physician act as a minimally competent, similarly trained, reasonable physician in similar circumstances would act when disclosing information.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breach of duty &ndash; Breach of duty is failure to meet the minimal standard of care.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injury &ndash; The injury is the harm that befalls the patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A causal relationship &ndash; A causal relationship between the breach and the harm is shown when the patient reasonably declares that he would have refused to undergo the procedure had he or she known the true nature of the risks.</p><p/><p>If all four elements are proven to the jury, the physician is liable for the tort of negligent nondisclosure. Typically, the proof of all four elements lies in the testimony of the plaintiff's expert witness, who must present the following information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/informed-procedural-consent/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Define the duty &ndash; The details that constitute an appropriate informed consent discussion are defined.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identify the breach &ndash; The details that were wrongly omitted are defined.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clarify the harm &ndash; The injuries that were suffered are defined.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identify alternatives &ndash; The alternatives that a reasonable patient might have selected instead are defined.

Thus, the standard is set by the profession, and the individual physician must adhere to accepted medical standards, as defined by the defendant's expert witness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8056860\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient-centered standards</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unlike the requirement for expert witnesses in jurisdictions in which the professional standard is applied, there is generally no need for an expert in the patient-centered jurisdictions. An expert may be helpful in presenting the scientific facts about procedures and risks. However, a lay jury is deemed capable of deciding what an ordinary patient would consider relevant in order to consent to a surgical procedure. There are both objective and subjective patient-centered standards:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Objective</strong> &ndash; The objective standard of care requires that the physician determine what a reasonable patient would find indispensable when evaluating his or her options and then include these issues in the informed consent dialogue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/informed-procedural-consent/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. For elective, cosmetic, or high-risk procedures, the physician's burden of disclosure is even higher because a reasonable patient might be more likely to decline the proposed procedure or choose another therapeutic option. The patient must show that, had he or she known the necessary and pertinent facts, he or she would have refused to proceed. Thus, the physician must disclose those facts that a reasonable patient in a similar situation would need to know in order to make an informed choice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/informed-procedural-consent/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Subjective</strong> &ndash; The subjective standard for disclosure requires the physician to relay facts that a particular patient deems important in the decision-making process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/informed-procedural-consent/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Proponents assert that the right to self-determination requires that a patient be able to decline a particular treatment even if a reasonable person would consent, and only a subjective standard can fully protect that right [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/informed-procedural-consent/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The subjective standard promotes the greatest patient autonomy as compared with the professional standard or objective standard. However, it is difficult for physicians to know what facts are relevant to an individual patient's decision making and defend against hindsight. As an example, an injured patient may state that he or she would not have consented to a procedure with the possibility of a particular poor outcome that was not disclosed during the informed consent dialogue. The patient need only declare his or her own particular belief that he would have refused, and the jury must then simply decide whether or not the patient's claim is credible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/informed-procedural-consent/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This standard is seldom used.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16860423\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The physician has a legal and ethical responsibility to provide adequate information to the patient so that he or she is able to process the information and make appropriate decisions. (See <a href=\"#H16860339\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No procedure can be undertaken without the patient's agreement. The patient's consent must be voluntary and competent. (See <a href=\"#H3315262\" class=\"local\">'Informed decision making'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In order to meet the requirements for effective, informed decision making, a physician must disclose material facts relevant to decision making, including the patient's diagnosis, proposed treatment, risks and benefits of the treatment, alternative treatments along with their risks and benefits, and the risks of refusal. (See <a href=\"#H3315269\" class=\"local\">'Material facts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A physician must answer truthfully, if asked, about the number of similar procedures or cases performed, and disclose success rates. He or she must disclose, even without inquiry, any financial conflict(s) of interest. (See <a href=\"#H3316516\" class=\"local\">'Physician disclosure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The physician must advise patients of all personnel involved in their care and their respective roles, including residents, students, and equipment representatives. (See <a href=\"#H19730393\" class=\"local\">'Personnel'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is prudent for the physician to inform patients of any reasonably foreseeable additional procedures that may be necessary for a successful outcome. (See <a href=\"#H3316932\" class=\"local\">'Additional procedures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The physician can maximize the effectiveness of an informed consent session by communicating in terms patients and their families can understand. Important elements of effective communication include focusing on the patient, using comprehensible language, offering educational material, and using interpreters when necessary. (See <a href=\"#H3315520\" class=\"local\">'Effective communication'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients may not accurately remember all of the facts disclosed in teaching sessions. Thus, the physician must document the content of informed consent sessions. (See <a href=\"#H3315562\" class=\"local\">'Documentation'</a> above.).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Failure to provide the necessary, relevant information in a way that truly communicates with the patient may constitute ineffective, and therefore nonexistent, consent. (See <a href=\"#H8537345\" class=\"local\">'Failure to obtain consent'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Berg JW, Appelbaum PS, Lidz CW, et al.
