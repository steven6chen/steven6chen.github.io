The disorder is commonly referred to as &quot;celiac sprue&quot; or &quot;gluten-sensitive enteropathy&quot; in the United States. It was first described by Samuel Gee in 1887, although a similar description of a chronic malabsorptive disorder was recorded as far back as the second century AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>As a general rule, there are six key elements in the management of patients with celiac disease, which can be summarized with the following acronym [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consultation with a skilled dietitian</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Education about the disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identification and treatment of nutritional deficiencies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Access to an advocacy group</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continuous long-term follow-up by a multidisciplinary team</p><p/><p>The recommendations made in this topic are generally consistent with guidelines from the British National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, the American Gastroenterological Association, the American College of Gastroenterology, and a consensus statement issued by the National Institutes of Health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>The management of celiac disease and its complications will be reviewed here. Its pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis are discussed separately.

Treatment of the patient with celiac disease begins with dietary counseling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7321257\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A gluten-free diet is recommended in patients with celiac disease (classic disease, atypical celiac disease, and asymptomatic or silent celiac disease). Patients with celiac disease should be referred to a registered dietitian who is knowledgeable about celiac disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations of celiac disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Classification'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with latent celiac disease (positive IgA endomysial antibody, but normal small bowel biopsy) are currently not advised to be on a gluten-free diet but should continue to be monitored and rebiopsied if symptoms develop. However, it is important that such patients are adequately evaluated with multiple intestinal biopsies since histologic abnormalities can be patchy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of celiac disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Small bowel biopsy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7321264\"><span class=\"h2\">Components of the gluten-free diet</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principal sources of dietary gluten are wheat, rye, and barley. Consumption of a gluten-free diet requires a major lifestyle change since gluten is contained in a variety of foods that are commonly consumed in a Western diet. Thus, it is usually helpful to provide written information and dietary counselling to improve compliance. A number of resources are available for patients with celiac disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celiac-disease-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Celiac disease in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As general rules, the following dietary advice can be given to all patients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Foods containing wheat, rye, and barley should be avoided.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Soybean or tapioca flours, rice, corn, buckwheat, and potatoes are safe.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Read labels on prepared foods and condiments carefully, paying particular attention to additives such as stabilizers or emulsifiers that may contain gluten.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distilled alcoholic beverages and vinegars, as well as wine, are gluten free. However, beers, ales, lagers, and malt vinegars should be avoided because they are often made from gluten-containing grains and are not distilled. However, in Europe gluten-free beers are now marketed and can be obtained worldwide.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dairy products may not be well tolerated initially, since many patients with celiac disease can have secondary lactose intolerance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lactose intolerance: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.) As a result, lactose-containing products should initially be avoided in patients whose symptoms appear to be worsened by them.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oats should be introduced into the diet with caution, and patients should be monitored for adverse reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Oat consumption should be limited to 50 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> (approximately 2 ounces) in patients with mild disease upon presentation or whose disease is in remission after a stringent gluten-free diet. The latter patients should be followed carefully for clinical or serologic evidence of disease recurrence after reintroducing oats. Patients with severe disease should avoid oats altogether.</p><p/><p>Although gluten is also found in oats, the toxicity of oats in celiac disease is now in doubt because some studies suggest that pure oat flour can be tolerated without disease recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/6-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-11</a>], while others do not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, for example, 52 adults with celiac disease in remission and 40 with newly diagnosed celiac disease were randomly assigned to a gluten-free diet without oats, or a gluten-free diet with a total daily consumption of 50 to 70 g of oats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. At the end of one year, no significant difference was observed in the nutritional status, symptoms, laboratory or histologic measures between the two groups. After 6 to 12 months of follow-up, the rate of disappearance of gliadin and reticulin antibodies and the decrease in intraepithelial lymphocytes were similar in the two groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A follow-up report suggested that the ability to tolerate oats persisted for at least five years in the majority of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Somewhat different conclusions were reached in another controlled trial involving 39 adults who were randomly assigned to either a gluten-free diet with 50 g of oat-containing products daily or to a gluten-free diet without oats for one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Quality of life scores were similar between the groups, and there were no significant differences in the villous structure of small bowel biopsies. However, patients consuming oats had significantly more gastrointestinal symptoms (including diarrhea and constipation) and had a significantly higher density of intraepithelial lymphocytes.</p><p/><p>There are a few reasons why oats may be better tolerated.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First, even though oats contain a sequence homology (ie, QQQPF) with gliadin peptides, which have been shown to be disease activating, this homology may not be relevant since T-cell activation requires larger epitopes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Second, oats contain a relatively smaller proportion of this toxic prolamin moiety compared with other gluten-containing cereals. This hypothesis is supported by studies on oat challenge in patients with celiac disease, which suggest that tolerance to oats depends at least in part upon the total amount consumed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Daily oats consumption less than 40 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> by patients whose celiac disease is in remission appears to be well tolerated, while larger daily intake is associated with disease recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, studies using these larger quantities were performed before the advent of small bowel biopsy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Finally, there may be variability in the immunogenicity of different oat cultivars, which may explain some of the disparate results when it comes to oat tolerability in patients with celiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p>Despite these observations, the long-term safety of oat consumption in patients with celiac disease is uncertain, and most studies that examined the safety of oats have included patients with relatively mild disease or whose disease was in remission upon reinstitution of oats in the diet. Furthermore, some patients may be exquisitely sensitive to oat prolamins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>Thus, at the present time, a reasonable approach is to limit oat consumption to 50 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> (approximately 2 ounces) in patients with mild disease upon presentation or whose disease is in remission after a stringent gluten-free diet. The latter patients should be followed carefully for clinical or serologic evidence of disease recurrence after reintroducing oats. Patients with severe disease should probably avoid oats altogether, especially since oat products obtained in the store are frequently contaminated with small amounts of other cereals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Is strict gluten avoidance necessary?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As gluten elimination poses several lifestyle restrictions, compliance with a strict gluten-free diet is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. This is in part because the ability to tolerate gluten in the diet is highly variable among patients. While some patients are exquisitely sensitive to even small amounts of gluten, other patients can tolerate the reintroduction of small amounts in their diet after achieving remission.</p><p>Despite this variable response, several arguments favor encouraging strict adherence to a gluten-free diet in most patients with established celiac disease regardless of clinical symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Despite feeling clinically well, patients may have a variety of micronutrient deficiencies that may ultimately have clinical sequelae such as bone loss due to vitamin D deficiency. These can be partially reversed with a gluten-free diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1905366138\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of bone loss'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple reports have suggested increased overall mortality and risk of malignancy (lymphoproliferative disease and gastrointestinal cancer) in patients with celiac disease compared to the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations of celiac disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although, in one study, the increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma persisted for five years after diagnosis despite adherence to a gluten-free diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], several other studies have suggested that the risk is decreased in patients adhering to a gluten-free diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At least two studies found that the likelihood that patients with celiac disease will develop other autoimmune disorders associated with celiac disease (eg, type 1 diabetes mellitus, connective tissue diseases, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and Graves' disease) appeared to be related to the duration of exposure to gluten [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>], although discordant data have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mothers with undiagnosed celiac disease appear to be at increased risk for having low birth weight newborns and preterm births compared to those whose disease has been diagnosed (and presumably treated) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p/><p>Trace amounts of gluten may be contained in products that are labeled as gluten-free. However, the small amount of gluten contained in these products does not necessarily cause treatment failure. A study evaluating occult gluten intake (from grain contaminants) among 76 patients on a gluten-free diet estimated that gluten contamination of up to 100 parts per million (up to a total of 30 mg per day) did not result in histologic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Interestingly, 13 of 59 naturally gluten-free products and 11 of 24 wheat starch-based gluten-free products contained gluten ranging from 20 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span>. Medications (pills) generally contain minimal gluten and do not need to be avoided. Information about gluten-free drugs is available online. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING THE RESPONSE TO A GLUTEN-FREE DIET</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rapidity of the response to a gluten-free diet is variable. Approximately 70 percent of patients have noticeable clinical improvement within two weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. As a general rule, symptoms improve faster than histology, especially when biopsies are obtained in the proximal intestine. The reason is incompletely understood; however, a possible explanation is that the less severely damaged distal small intestine recovers faster than the proximal intestine, which is typically more severely affected due to relatively increased exposure to gluten [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p>We suggest that patients be evaluated four to six weeks following the initiation of a gluten-free diet at which time a complete blood count, folate, B12, iron studies, liver chemistries, and serologic testing should be performed. It is important to note that women often experience breast tenderness for three months after starting a gluten-free diet and reassurance should be provided.</p><p>Patients with celiac disease should continue to be monitored at regular intervals for residual or new symptoms, assessed for adherence to gluten-free diet, by both history and serological testing, and for complications of celiac disease. Periodic medical follow-up should be performed by a clinician with knowledge of celiac disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F89799\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef89799 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7321280\"><span class=\"h2\">Serologic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IgA anti tissue transglutaminase (tTG) or IgA (or IgG) deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP) should be used to monitor the response to gluten-free diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>For whichever assay that will be used, a pretreatment antibody level should be determined at the time of diagnosis. Exclusion of gluten from the diet results in a gradual decline in serum IgA anti-gliadin and IgA tTG levels (half-life of six to eight weeks). A normal baseline value is typically reached within 3 to 12 months depending upon the pre-treatment concentrations. Normal IgA tTG levels do not reliably indicate recovery from villous atrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Conversely, if the levels do not fall as anticipated, the patient is usually continuing to ingest gluten either intentionally or inadvertently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Although the general patterns above can be helpful, the accuracy of these tests in establishing compliance with a gluten-free diet is unsettled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/38,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,40</a>]. The value of these tests in monitoring adherence to a gluten-free diet is particularly limited in three respects:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The test is useless if antibody levels are not elevated prior to therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inter-assay variations in test results may be substantial and make interpretation difficult. Serial samples should ideally be sent to one laboratory for testing to keep inter-assay variation to a minimum. Minor fluctuations in IgA anti-gliadin or IgA TTG levels are the norm and their importance should not be over interpreted.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistently high antibody levels usually reflect continued exposure to substantial amounts of dietary gluten. However, antibody levels will fall when dietary gluten intake is reduced, and they are not a sensitive indicator of occasional or minor dietary transgressions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p/><p>Serum IgG anti-gliadin and IgA endomysial antibody levels also fall when patients with celiac disease adhere to a strict gluten-free diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>]. However, the decline in IgG anti-gliadin is more gradual than for IgA anti-gliadin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>], making it less useful in monitoring recent dietary adherence. IgA endomysial antibody levels are more costly and results are more difficult to quantify than IgA antigliadin or IgA tTG.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7322256\"><span class=\"h2\">Small bowel biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The need for a follow-up biopsy in patients with clinical improvement has been debated, especially since serologic testing can be used to monitor recovery and compliance with the diet. The consensus is that re-biopsy should be undertaken four to six months after commencing a gluten-free diet to confirm the diagnosis and a satisfactory response to the diet. An upper endoscopy with biopsy should be performed in patients with established celiac disease who fail to respond to a gluten-free diet or with relapse of symptoms despite a gluten-free diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of celiac disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7322438\"><span class=\"h2\">Gluten re-challenge</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gluten re-challenge is unnecessary according to a consensus statement issued by the National Institutes of Health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Guidelines issued by the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (ESPGAN) suggested that gluten re-challenge is not mandatory in patients with good improvement in symptoms, histology, and a decline in the titer of anti-endomysial antibodies (which usually return to normal in three to six months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. According to the ESPGAN guidelines, gluten re-challenge should only be used in equivocal cases such as when no initial biopsy was performed, biopsies were inadequate or atypical, in communities with high rates of other enteropathies, or in situations when patients plan to abandon a gluten-free diet in an uncontrolled way. Gluten re-challenge should be performed after obtaining a control biopsy on a gluten-free diet and repeat biopsies should be obtained two weeks to six months later with the recognition that relapse can take five to seven years or more.</p><p>A rare hazard in giving a gluten re-challenge is the development of fulminant diarrhea, with resulting dehydration, acidosis, and other metabolic disturbances (a condition known as &quot;gliadin shock&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Such patients should be treated with glucocorticoids. There is a suggestion that use of gluten challenge in young children may be associated with an increased likelihood of development of autoimmune disorders such as insulin dependent diabetes mellitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">NON-RESPONDERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Non-responders are individuals who have persistent symptoms or serologic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> histologic abnormalities after two years on a gluten-free diet. The majority of patients with celiac disease respond to a gluten-free diet but approximately 5 percent of individuals do not. </p><p>In patients who are incomplete responders or non-responders, it is important to consider that not all clinical features of celiac disease respond at the same rate. (See <a href=\"#H1905366228\" class=\"local\">'Dermatitis herpetiformis'</a> below.) Furthermore, bone loss due to secondary hyperparathyroidism and peripheral neuropathy may only improve partially despite a gluten-free diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

In a randomized trial, 342 adults with celiac disease who had been on a gluten-free diet for 12 months or longer were assigned to larazotide 0.5, 1, or 2 mg or placebo three times daily for 12 weeks to relieve ongoing symptoms while continuing their gluten-free diet during the study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. The primary endpoint was the difference in average on-treatment Celiac Disease Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale score. The primary endpoint was met with the 0.5 mg dose of larazotide acetate but not the 1 and 2 mg doses. Treatment with larazotide (0.5 mg dose) also resulted in an increase in the number of improved symptom days and a reduction in the number of symptomatic days, severity of abdominal pain, and non-gastrointestinal symptoms of tiredness and headache. The safety of larazotide was comparable with placebo. While the reason for the lack of efficacy of higher doses is unclear, it may be due to peptide aggregation at higher doses. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Other diagnoses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An erroneous diagnosis of celiac sprue may result from false positive serology, specifically IgA anti-gliadin antibodies as raised titre occurs in 5 percent of normal subjects.

Intestinal stricturing can develop with resulting small bowel obstruction. The disease most commonly presents in middle-aged patients with underlying celiac disease. Evaluation should begin with an abdominal computed tomography (CT) enterography or magnetic resonance (MR) enterography scan and upper endoscopy, which, if negative, should be followed by a capsule endoscopy. Ulcerative jejunitis responds poorly to a gluten-free diet and is associated with an unfavorable prognosis. Up to one-third of patients die from complications. The prognosis can be improved if the ulcerated or strictured segment can be resected.</p><p>Lymphoma should be suspected in patients with celiac disease presenting with the clinical features described above for ulcerative jejunitis. Among patients who initially responded to a gluten-free diet, the diagnostic dilemma is whether the return of symptoms is due to dietary lapses or the development of lymphoma. Clinical manifestations more suggestive of lymphoma, such as fever, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, duodenal mass(es), or ascites, may help the diagnostic conundrum, but their presence implies more advanced disease. Other presentations of lymphoma include acute perforation, gastrointestinal obstruction, or, less commonly, gastrointestinal hemorrhage.</p><p>The evaluation should begin with an abdominal CT enterography or a magnetic resonance (MR) enterography scan, upper endoscopy and capsule endoscopy. In patients with lymphoma, the histology of adjacent intestine is often indistinguishable from untreated celiac disease. However, it remains uncertain whether these patients had occult celiac disease that became evident only after lymphoma developed, or whether the lymphoma caused the development of celiac-like histology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H7321257\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that patients with celiac disease be referred to a dietitian who is familiar with counselling patients on a gluten-free diet. Providing written information and referral to a support group can also be helpful. Periodic medical follow-up should be performed by a clinician with knowledge of celiac disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F89799\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef89799 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celiac-disease-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Celiac disease in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be tested for deficiency of vitamins (A, D, E, B12), copper, zinc, carotene, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a>, ferritin, and iron. Deficiency in thiamine, vitamin B6, magnesium, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selenium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">selenium</a> may also occur depending on the disease severity and dietary intake and should be tested for in the presence of clinical signs or symptoms of a deficiency. A gluten-free diet may induce troublesome constipation since it is low in roughage. This usually responds to the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psyllium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">psyllium</a> seed husks. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-malabsorption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of malabsorption&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H1905366097\" class=\"local\">'Repletion of nutritional deficiencies'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone loss (principally osteopenia and less often osteoporosis) is common in celiac disease, and can occur in patients without gastrointestinal symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations of celiac disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Much of the bone loss is related to secondary hyperparathyroidism, which is probably due to vitamin D deficiency. It can only be partially reversed with a gluten-free diet. Patients diagnosed with celiac disease should be evaluated for bone loss using a DXA (dual energy x-ray absorptiometry) scan and appropriate therapy instituted based upon the results. (See <a href=\"#H1905366138\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of bone loss'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pneumococcal vaccination is suggested since celiac disease is associated with hyposplenism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations of celiac disease in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumococcal-vaccination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pneumococcal vaccination in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be followed clinically and with serologic testing to determine response to dietary therapy. An upper endoscopy with biopsy should be performed in patients with established celiac disease who fail to respond to a gluten-free diet or with relapse of symptoms despite a gluten-free diet. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring the response to a gluten-free diet'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of patients with celiac disease respond to a gluten-free diet. The most common reasons for a lack of response are poor compliance or inadvertent gluten ingestion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79790\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79790 \">table 1</a>). Thus, we suggest a meticulous dietary history should be obtained, and dietary counselling pursued with an experienced dietitian in patients who continue to have symptoms or persistent histologic abnormalities, or in those in whom serum antibody titers have not declined. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Non-responders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who do not respond despite adherence to a gluten-free diet fall into four main categories, those with: clinical or histologic features that are caused by other disorders; concurrent conditions, refractory sprue; ulcerative jejunitis or intestinal lymphoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F89800\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef89800 \">algorithm 2</a>).
