Different types of chemicals can cause a chemical eye injury. Examples include chemicals found in cleaning products, bleach, hair dyes, and lawn fertilizers.</p><p>Some chemicals cause only mild or short-term symptoms. Other chemicals can cause severe damage, including scarring of the cornea (the clear tissue that covers the colored part of the eye (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F70420\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70420 \">figure 1</a>)) or vision loss. How mild or serious an injury is depends on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The type of chemical</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How long the chemical is in the eye</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How far into the eye the chemical spreads</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13207715\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a chemical eye injury?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble seeing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eye pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being unable to open your eye</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Redness of the white part of your eye</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bright light bothering your eye</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13207730\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I should do on my own to treat a chemical eye injury?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You should wash the chemical out of your eye right away with water. You can put your eye under a faucet or shower. Use cool water, and try to wash out your eye for 15 to 30 minutes. If you have contact lenses in, do not remove your lenses first. If the chemical got only in 1 eye, keep your other eye closed so the chemical doesn't flow into that eye. Do not rub or press on your eye.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13207745\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. After you wash out your eye, see a doctor or nurse right away.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13207760\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You will not need tests. But your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms and the chemical that got in your eye, and do an exam.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13207775\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a chemical eye injury treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The doctor or nurse will continue to wash the chemical out of your eye. Depending on the chemical, this can last hours.</p><p>Other treatment will likely include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain-relieving eye drops</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eye drops or ointments to help prevent an infection</p><p/><p>Depending on your injury, you might also need to see an eye specialist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13207790\"><span class=\"h1\">Can a chemical eye injury be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You can help prevent a chemical eye injury by wearing safety glasses or goggles when you work with chemicals. To prevent a chemical eye injury in your child, keep cleaning supplies out of your child's reach.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13207805\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=corneal-abrasion-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Corneal abrasion (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
