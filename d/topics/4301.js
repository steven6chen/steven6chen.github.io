The word &quot;colorectal&quot; is just a shortened way of saying colon and rectal.</p><p>Colorectal cancer can be serious. But there are many ways to treat it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H454757648\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for colorectal cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, there are a few tests that can find colorectal cancer. Your doctor or nurse can explain your choices.</p><p>If your doctor or nurse thinks you have colorectal cancer, he or she will probably suggest a test called a &quot;colonoscopy.&quot; During a colonoscopy, the doctor inserts a tube and a tiny camera into your anus and up to your colon. That way, he or she can look for cancer or other problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H454757655\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of colorectal cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Colorectal cancer might not cause any symptoms at first. When it does cause symptoms, it can cause:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stomach pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A change in your bowel movements (number, texture, or size)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood in your bowel movements</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling weak or tired</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H454757662\"><span class=\"h1\">How is colorectal cancer treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most types of colorectal cancer are treated with one or more of these:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to remove the part of the colon or rectum that has cancer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy, which is the medical term for medicines that kill cancer cells or stop them from growing.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation therapy</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H454757669\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my body work normally after surgery?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on what type of surgery you have. If your doctor can reconnect your colon or rectum after removing the part with cancer, you should be able to have bowel movements normally. But if your doctor cannot reconnect your colon or rectum, he or she will make a hole in your belly and attach the end of the colon or a loop of intestine to that hole. The hole is called a &quot;colostomy.&quot; Your bowel movements will come out through the opening into a bag that is glued to your skin.</p><p>Some people need to have a colostomy only for a short time. Then they can have another surgery to reconnect their colon or rectum. Other people need to have a colostomy for the rest of their life. If you need a colostomy, your doctor or nurse will put you in touch with people who can help you learn to use it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H454757676\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After you finish treatment, you should see your doctor or nurse every so often for a few years. That way he or she can check to see if the cancer comes back. You will probably have to have blood tests every so often, a few more colonoscopy tests, plus a special kind of X-ray called a &quot;CT scan.&quot; Your doctor or nurse will also talk to you about your mood, stress level, sex life, and any other problems you might have after finishing treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H454757683\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colonoscopy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Colonoscopy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bloody-stools-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bloody stools (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-are-clinical-trials-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What are clinical trials?
