These disorders are categorized as classical NK cell deficiency (CNKD) and functional NK cell deficiency (FNKD).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In CNKD, NK cell developmental status or survival is abnormal, often leading to decreased NK cell numbers in the peripheral blood.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In FNKD, NK cells are appropriately developed and present but are functionally impaired.</p><p/><p>The management of patients with these disorders is discussed here. The biology of NK cells, the clinical manifestations of NK cell disorders, and the evaluation of patients suspected of having NK cell defects are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NK cell deficiency syndromes: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Therapy for patients with NK cell deficiency syndromes is largely empiric, due to the small numbers of cases described in the literature. Active infections must be identified and treated aggressively, as with any immunodeficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-immunodeficiency-overview-of-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary immunodeficiency: Overview of management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The use of specific therapies is based either on theoretical utility or anecdotal reports of benefit (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F68545\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68545 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTIVIRAL PROPHYLAXIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NK cell disorders are characterized clinically by susceptibility to severe <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> recurrent infection with herpes viruses, including varicella-zoster virus (VZV), herpes simplex virus (HSV) I and II, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV). There is also a marked susceptibility in some patients to human papillomaviruses (HPV).</p><p>In patients who are suspected or known to have classical NK cell deficiency type 1 (CNKD1) with GATA2 deficiency, prophylaxis for <em>Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare</em> should be considered, as the risk for this infection is increased in some patients with this genetic defect. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NK cell deficiency syndromes: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical and laboratory features'</a>.)</p><p>Prophylactic antiviral regimens should be tailored to the infectious history of the individual patient. Serologic tests should be performed to determine if an NK cell-deficient individual has experienced infections with known herpesviruses. Nucleic acid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests of peripheral blood should also be performed to ensure that a patient does not have active and inadequately controlled infection. In our clinic, we assess for past exposure to the following viruses:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VZV</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HSV I and II</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CMV</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EBV</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6)</p><p/><p>Evidence of past exposure without detectable viral nucleic acid in peripheral blood or <span class=\"nowrap\">active/recurrent</span> viral disease indicates that the patient is able to contain that particular pathogen to some extent and thus does not require prophylaxis against that pathogen.</p><p>If a patient with NK cell deficiency is na&iuml;ve to HSV or CMV, however, then we suggest administering permanent prophylaxis with an appropriate antiviral agent (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valacyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valacyclovir</a> for HSV, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valganciclovir</a> for CMV). There are no studies assessing the <span class=\"nowrap\">risk/benefit</span> ratio of such an approach, but in the absence of this information, the author would suggest indefinite prophylaxis.</p><p>In those for whom they are prescribed, the prophylactic regimens are continued indefinitely. Doses are derived from regimens used in more common secondary immunodeficiency diseases, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-immunodeficiency-overview-of-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary immunodeficiency: Overview of management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection-in-immunocompetent-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of herpes simplex virus type 1 infection in immunocompetent patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Breakthrough infectious episodes should be treated with higher dose treatment regimens or with the intravenous form of the drug, where appropriate. This suggestion is based upon anecdotal clinical experiences described in case reports.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMUNIZATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The administration of recombinant human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine to both female and male patients is suggested, due to the potential risk of severe disease in those with NK cell defects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-vaccination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human papillomavirus vaccination&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In contrast, we would advise consideration of the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varicella-virus-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">varicella vaccine</a> on a case-by-case basis. The varicella vaccine contains live-attenuated virus and thus could theoretically place the patient at risk for disseminated infection. However, no cases of disseminated infection with vaccine-strain varicella have been reported in patients with isolated NK cell deficiencies who were vaccinated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccination-for-the-prevention-of-chickenpox-primary-varicella-infection#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vaccination for the prevention of chickenpox (primary varicella infection)&quot;, section on 'Immunocompromised hosts'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMUNOGLOBULIN REPLACEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with classical NK cell deficiency (CNKD) or functional NK cell deficiency (FNKD) who have experienced a life-threatening infection with one of the viruses that pose a threat to these patients and are na&iuml;ve to others, it is reasonable to consider regular <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> replacement therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Theoretically, the antiviral antibodies contained in gammaglobulin would provide some protection against these viruses, including herpesviruses for which there are no specific prophylactic antiviral therapies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-therapy-in-primary-immunodeficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune globulin therapy in primary immunodeficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">POSSIBLE ADJUNCTIVE THERAPIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are relatively few therapies that are known to increase NK cell activities, but interleukin-2 (IL-2) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=interferon-alfa-2b-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">interferon alfa-2b</a> are of potential value in both functional NK cell deficiency (FNKD) and classical NK cell deficiency (CNKD):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with FNKD, these therapies might increase NK cell function.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In CNKD, certain biologic therapies can promote some additional development or survival of NK cells.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Interleukin-2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One biologic agent that is capable of increasing NK cell activities is interleukin-2 (IL-2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. IL-2 has been used in individuals with malignancy and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and has been shown to increase NK cell activity. It has also been reported to have clinical benefit in diseases having impaired NK cell function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-treatment/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p>Based upon these observations, the in vitro responsiveness of NK cells to IL-2 in a patient with FNKD can be evaluated. If there is a convincing in vitro response, as determined by a greater than twofold increase in NK cell cytolytic activity, then low-dose IL-2 therapy may be considered as an experimental adjunctive treatment. We suggest that this be administered only by clinicians with experience in the use of this agent.</p><p>As demonstrated in other diseases, there are a variety of successful IL-2 treatment regimens that increase NK cell function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-treatment/abstract/3,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6,7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the author's unpublished, anecdotal experience, IL-2 (at a dose of 0.5 to 1 million <span class=\"nowrap\">units/m<sup>2</sup></span> given subcutaneously daily for five consecutive days) can induce an increase in NK cell cytotoxic activity in those patients who have been shown to respond in vitro. If the patient appears to improve, the treatment can be repeated every seven to eight weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alternatively, a dose of 0.5 to 1 million <span class=\"nowrap\">units/m<sup>2</sup></span> can be given subcutaneously three times per week as continuous therapy. This can help induce and sustain NK cell function in some patients. Aside from injection site reactions, either regimen is relatively well-tolerated.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Interferon alfa</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=interferon-alfa-2b-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Interferon alfa-2b</a> enhances the cytotoxic activity of NK cells, and systemic treatment of a patient with refractory periungual warts and NK cell dysfunction resulted in dramatic improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-treatment/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. There is also preliminary experience with use of interferon alfa in patients with classical NK cell deficiency type 1 (CNKD1 due to GATA2 deficiency), with clinical improvement of warts as well as increased NK cell numbers and functional activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This agent warrants further study, since its use is only anecdotal. However, side effects include potentially severe cytopenias, flu-like syndrome, and depression. Aside from use in patients with NK cell dysfunction and intractable warts, use of interferon alfa-2b is not recommended outside of investigational protocols.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">HEMATOPOIETIC CELL TRANSPLANTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with particularly severe past infections and acceptably matched donors, hematopoietic cell transplantation may be considered in an attempt to correct the presumed hematopoietic defect. The severity of the patient's illness would have to be balanced against the risks of transplant. Successful hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a matched, unrelated donor was reported in a seven-year-old girl who had suffered severe disseminated varicella infection at age four, which was complicated by encephalitis, vasculitis, and macrophage activation syndrome with multiple-organ involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Laboratory evaluation prior to transplantation revealed an absence of both NK cells and B cells. The child was free of infections and had a normal lymphocyte profile four years after transplantation.</p><p>Other case reports have described patients who survived initial transplantation but reportedly succumbed to complications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-primary-immunodeficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematopoietic cell transplantation for primary immunodeficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3383971138\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTIVIRAL CELL THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While only available experimentally, antiviral cell therapy, in which cytotoxic T cells are generated in vitro from the individual patient or a human-leukocyte antigen (HLA)-compatible donor, presents a potential therapeutic option for classical NK cell deficiency (CNKD) or functional NK cell deficiency (FNKD) patients who have significant morbidity from an otherwise difficult-to-control infection. This is a consideration in centers where this option is available as a bridge to hematopoietic cell transplantation. In this context, antiviral cell therapy can be used to reduce viral loads prior to transplant, to rescue a patient from increased viral replication after transplant, or potentially as a viral load-reducing therapy on its own. A single patient with CNKD was reported in a series of primary immunodeficiency patients treated with antiviral cell therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-treatment/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. This patient had substantive Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) viremia after transplant and received antiviral cell therapy developed from the cells of the hematopoietic cell transplantation donor. EBV loads were reduced, and the patient survived.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1697199154\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
