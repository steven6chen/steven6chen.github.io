Nocardiosis is typically regarded as an opportunistic infection, but approximately one-third of infected patients are immunocompetent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-nocardiosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Immunocompromise'</a> below.)</p><p>Two characteristics of nocardiosis are its ability to disseminate to virtually any organ, particularly the central nervous system, and its tendency to relapse or progress despite appropriate therapy.</p><p>The microbiology, taxonomy, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of nocardiosis will be reviewed here.

These organisms are phylogenetically diverse but morphologically similar, exhibiting characteristic filamentous branching with fragmentation into bacillary or coccoid forms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-nocardiosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Aerobic actinomyces that cause human and veterinary disease include <em>Nocardia</em>, <em>Gordona</em>, <em>Tsukamurella</em>, <em>Streptomyces</em>, <em>Rhodococcus</em>, <em>Mycobacteria</em>, and <em>Corynebacteria</em>. Anaerobic genera of medical importance include <em>Actinomyces</em>, <em>Arachnia</em>, <em>Rothia</em>, and <em>Bifidobacterium</em>.</p><p><em>Nocardia</em> typically appear as delicate filamentous gram-positive branching rods (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F80426\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80426 \">picture 1</a>) that appear similar to <em>Actinomyces</em> species. <em>Nocardia</em> can usually be differentiated from <em>Actinomyces</em> by acid-fast staining, as <em>Nocardia</em> typically exhibit varying degrees of acid fastness due to the mycolic acid content of the cell wall (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F66553\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66553 \">picture 2</a>). Another useful clue is that <em>Nocardia</em> grow under aerobic conditions, whereas <em>Actinomyces</em> grow under anaerobic conditions.</p><p>In the laboratory, <em>Nocardia</em> can display both aerial branching and substrate branching into the media or along its surface. These organisms were once considered fungi because of their hyphal-like appearance, but molecular analysis of their cell wall has confirmed their classification as bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-nocardiosis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>Formal species identification is best done using molecular techniques (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Taxonomy'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TAXONOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The genus <em>Nocardia</em> includes more than 80 species, at least 33 of which cause disease in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-nocardiosis/abstract/1,4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,7</a>]. <em>Nocardia</em> species were originally classified based upon biochemical properties. However, molecular techniques are now the preferred methods for speciation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-nocardiosis#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of nocardiosis&quot;, section on 'Speciation'</a>.)</p><p>Molecular methods have led to reclassification and renaming of many <em>Nocardia</em> isolates. For example, isolates that in the past had been identified as <em>N. asteroides</em> complex have now been renamed to other or new species. Because of this, <em>N. asteroides</em>, once a common species, is now rarely seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-nocardiosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Also, molecular studies indicate that <em>N. brasiliensis</em>, <em>N. otitidiscaviarum</em>, and <em>N. transvalensis</em>, once thought to be fairly homogeneous genera, also exhibit diverse characteristics, and it is anticipated that new species will continue to emerge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-nocardiosis/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H686793549\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Nocardia </em>species are not members of normal human flora. <em>Nocardia</em> species are found worldwide in soil, decaying vegetable matter, and aquatic environments and can become airborne, particularly on dust particles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-nocardiosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

As an example, a cluster of nosocomial cases of postoperative sternal wound infection with <em>N. farcinica</em> was caused by an isolate that was identical to one cultured from the hands and home of a healthy healthcare worker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-nocardiosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p>In the early 1970s, the incidence of nocardiosis in the United States was estimated to be approximately 500 to 1000 new cases per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-nocardiosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This probably represented an underestimate since nocardiosis is not a reportable disease and infection is difficult to diagnose. The current incidence is likely to be much higher, as the United States population has increased substantially since then and the proportion of individuals at risk for nocardiosis has greatly increased (eg, transplant recipients and HIV-infected patients). Some authors now regard nocardiosis to be an emerging and increasing infectious disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-nocardiosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H686793576\"><span class=\"h2\">Species prevalence and distribution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thirty-three <em>Nocardia</em> species have been shown to cause disease in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-nocardiosis/abstract/1,4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,6</a>] with variation in the frequency of species with geographical region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-nocardiosis/abstract/8,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,19</a>].

The ability to combat host resistance to infection appears to vary with the strain and growth phase of the bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-nocardiosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Bacteria that are in log-phase exhibit filamentous growth and are resistant to phagocytosis. When phagocytosis does occur, inhibition of phagosome-lysosome fusion has been observed with some nocardial strains, thereby avoiding hydrolysis by the host cell. The production of a bacterial cell surface&ndash;associated superoxide dismutase and possibly increased production of catalase may be involved in resistance to human neutrophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-nocardiosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>L-forms are cell wall&ndash;deficient variants of some bacterial species, including <em>Nocardia</em>. L-forms have been recovered from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in human nocardiosis and cause disease in animal models. Lifelong persistence of L-forms has been demonstrated in murine models, and it has been postulated that L-forms may be related to the tendency of nocardiosis to relapse and to recur years after successful initial antimicrobial therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-nocardiosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Some species have enhanced virulence. <em>N. farcinica</em> appears to be more virulent than some other species, since infection with this species is more likely to result in disseminated disease and tends to be more resistant to antimicrobials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-nocardiosis/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>].

Although not all mechanisms are fully understood, it is clear that cell-mediated immunity is crucial in containing <em>Nocardia</em> spp infection.</p><p>The initial host response to nocardiosis involves neutrophils and local macrophages, which inhibit but do not kill the bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-nocardiosis/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. This inhibition helps to limit the spread of infection until a specific cell-mediated response can occur. A population of immune-primed T cells enhances phagocytosis, stimulates cellular response, and may be capable of direct cytotoxicity to the bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-nocardiosis/abstract/5,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,31</a>].</p><p>Gamma delta T lymphocytes may play a crucial role in the host defenses against <em>Nocardia</em> spp. In a murine model, gamma delta T cell&ndash;deficient mice died within 14 days after inoculation with <em>N. asteroides</em> at a dose that was not lethal to control mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-nocardiosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].
