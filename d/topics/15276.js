Current studies, in our view, continue to support a beneficial role in selected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-methylxanthines-in-the-treatment-of-copd/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. However, methylxanthines have a narrow therapeutic index; as a result, toxicity can be a significant problem with chronic use, and careful monitoring is essential.</p><p>The role of methylxanthines in the management of patients with COPD will be reviewed here. The role of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> in the treatment of asthma and the management of acute exacerbations of COPD and of stable COPD are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-use-in-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Theophylline use in asthma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-stable-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECTS ON FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) seek assistance because of functional impairment. Four independent determinants of functional impairment have been identified: dyspnea ratings, exercise capacity, respiratory mechanics, and respiratory muscle strength [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-methylxanthines-in-the-treatment-of-copd/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Dyspnea ratings appear to influence general health status to a greater extent than do physiologic data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-methylxanthines-in-the-treatment-of-copd/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], while performance in a standardized walking test correlates best with dyspnea ratings and the quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-methylxanthines-in-the-treatment-of-copd/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>]. It is within this context that the clinical indications for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> in COPD can be evaluated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients with a serious life-threatening illness&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Dyspnea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One review of the efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> in COPD found that 6 of 10 studies cited showed an improvement in dyspnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-methylxanthines-in-the-treatment-of-copd/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Furthermore, those studies that utilized the more sensitive dyspnea ratings demonstrated the greatest benefit. Five additional studies, employing either theophylline alone or combination therapy (theophylline plus aerosolized beta 2-agonists and anticholinergics) in patients with stable COPD, have subsequently been performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-methylxanthines-in-the-treatment-of-copd/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>]. Two of these trials showed a beneficial effect of theophylline. One report, for example, randomized 38 patients with severe COPD who were treated with theophylline to either continued therapy or replacement of theophylline by placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-methylxanthines-in-the-treatment-of-copd/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The percentage of patients experiencing clinical deterioration was much lower in the group maintained on theophylline (15 versus 72 percent).</p><p>The three other studies found no beneficial effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> in the population as a whole, but noted improvement in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-methylxanthines-in-the-treatment-of-copd/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. One report employing combination therapy concluded that, despite an overall lack of benefit, approximately one-third of patients were subjective responders in whom both dyspnea and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) improved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-methylxanthines-in-the-treatment-of-copd/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In contrast, the subjective nonresponders failed to achieve a postbronchodilator increase in FEV<sub>1</sub>.</p><p>Part of the observed variability in response may be related to plasma <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> levels. One study, for example, noted symptomatic improvement at a theophylline level of 17 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L,</span> but not at 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-methylxanthines-in-the-treatment-of-copd/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The improvement in dyspnea was associated with a reduction in trapped gas volume and an increase in distance walked and vital capacity.</p><p>In summary, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> can reduce dyspnea, but this effect is seen in only some patients and may be related to theophylline levels. The benefit may be mediated by increases in airway caliber or respiratory muscle function, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a decline in trapped gas volume. Antiinflammatory and immunomodulating actions of the drug may also be important in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-methylxanthines-in-the-treatment-of-copd/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Because of the lack of predictable response, the efficacy of therapy needs to be assessed on an individual basis and objectively documented with ratings of dyspnea. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-dyspnea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of dyspnea&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-dyspnea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with dyspnea&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Exercise capacity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> on exercise capacity also appears to be variable. Four initial studies showed that theophylline therapy was associated with a number of hemodynamic benefits, including reductions in pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, right and left ventricular end-diastolic pressures, and increases in ejection fraction or cardiac index; however, the effect on the anaerobic threshold and exercise capacity remained unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-methylxanthines-in-the-treatment-of-copd/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Subsequent studies have generally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-methylxanthines-in-the-treatment-of-copd/abstract/7,11,13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11,13-16</a>], but not always [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-methylxanthines-in-the-treatment-of-copd/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], shown an improvement in exercise capacity:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> withdrawal trial noted above, cessation of theophylline was associated with a deterioration in the six-minute walking distance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-methylxanthines-in-the-treatment-of-copd/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a second study, 22 patients with severe stable COPD were randomized to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-methylxanthines-in-the-treatment-of-copd/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The theophylline group showed an improvement in maximum work rate that correlated with an increase in ventilatory capacity as assessed by the maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV). No changes were observed in pulmonary function, anaerobic threshold, or dyspnea index (minute ventilation at peak <span class=\"nowrap\">exercise/MVV)</span>. This combination of results suggests that the improvement in MVV, and thus exercise capacity, may have been related to increases in respiratory muscle strength or central respiratory drive. However, neither of these parameters was directly addressed in the study.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a third trial, 34 patients were enrolled in single-patient, randomized, double-blind, multiple crossover comparisons of the effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> versus placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-methylxanthines-in-the-treatment-of-copd/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Approximately 21 percent of patients manifested a positive response to theophylline as measured by the chronic respiratory disease questionnaire and the 6-minute walk test.</p><p/><p>The pathophysiology of exercise intolerance in COPD and of the benefit of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> are not completely understood. Factors other than the severity of lung dysfunction may play a contributory role. As an example, left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction less than 40 percent with wall motion abnormalities) has been noted in one-third of patients with progressive COPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-methylxanthines-in-the-treatment-of-copd/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], suggesting in some cases the possibility of clinically significant myocardial ischemia. The administration of a methylxanthine to patients with chronic stable coronary artery disease has been shown to improve indicators of myocardial ischemia in a concentration-dependent manner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-methylxanthines-in-the-treatment-of-copd/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] and to enhance exercise tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-methylxanthines-in-the-treatment-of-copd/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Theophylline may act by blocking A1-adenosine receptors, resulting in redistribution of blood flow to the underperfused subendocardium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-methylxanthines-in-the-treatment-of-copd/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>In summary, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> can enhance exercise performance in COPD. This benefit may be mediated by improvements in respiratory mechanics (due to bronchodilation), gas exchange, respiratory muscle function, hemodynamics, and perhaps myocardial perfusion in patients with ischemic heart disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-physiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise physiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Respiratory mechanics</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Stable COPD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Numerous studies have shown that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> can induce significant bronchodilation in stable COPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-methylxanthines-in-the-treatment-of-copd/abstract/1,6,8-11,13,20-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,8-11,13,20-29</a>]. The improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub> or vital capacity (VC) has ranged from 8 to 35 percent, with the greatest response seen with combination therapy, defined as theophylline plus either aerosolized beta 2-agonists or anticholinergics. The following observations have also been made:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aerosolized <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipratropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipratropium</a> bromide appears to produce more bronchodilation than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> when only monotherapy is used.

Ipratropium bromide has also been shown to be more cost-effective than theophylline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-methylxanthines-in-the-treatment-of-copd/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salmeterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">salmeterol</a> significantly improved morning and evening peak expiratory flow rates compared to monotherapy with either drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-methylxanthines-in-the-treatment-of-copd/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with stable COPD who are already on two long acting aerosolized bronchodilators (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=formoterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">formoterol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tiotropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tiotropium</a>), the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> did not significantly improve the FEV<sub>1</sub>, FVC, dyspnea ratings, or frequency of rescue use of a short-acting beta 2-agonist, compared to the addition of placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-methylxanthines-in-the-treatment-of-copd/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

In the largest randomized trial that examined this issue, 80 non-acidotic (pH &gt;7.32) patients with an acute COPD exacerbation received nebulized bronchodilators and oral glucocorticoids, and were randomly assigned to receive intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aminophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aminophylline</a> (0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/hour)</span> or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-methylxanthines-in-the-treatment-of-copd/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Increases in maximal inspiratory pressure (Pimax) and MVV have been described, which may have been mediated in part by increases in muscle strength.

However, theophylline users were more likely to have a COPD exacerbation than users of inhaled glucocorticoids. As this was not a prospective or randomized trial, further data are needed before theophylline is employed for this reason.
