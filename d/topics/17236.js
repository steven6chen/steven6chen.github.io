The widespread use of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) has led to a decline in the incidence of glandular infiltration by opportunistic infections and neoplasms.</p><p>This topic addresses the evaluation of thyroid disorders in HIV-infected patients. Issues related to pituitary and adrenal disorders, insulin resistance, bone and calcium disorders, and hypogonadism are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pituitary-and-adrenal-gland-dysfunction-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pituitary and adrenal gland dysfunction in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of HIV-associated lipodystrophy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of HIV-associated lipodystrophy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-and-calcium-disorders-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bone and calcium disorders in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypogonadism-in-hiv-infected-males\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypogonadism in HIV-infected males&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, the approach to thyroid disorders in an HIV-infected patient is similar to that in an uninfected individual. However, HIV infection may also cause changes in thyroid function that are adaptive and do not require treatment. In addition, many of the symptoms and signs of thyroid dysfunction are nonspecific and can overlap with those of non-endocrine disorders that are common in HIV-infected patients. Lastly, some medications used to treat HIV infection and its complications can induce thyroid dysfunction. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Effects of medications'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GLANDULAR INFILTRATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infection by a diverse array of organisms, as well as HIV-associated malignancies (eg, Kaposi sarcoma, lymphoma), have been detected in the thyroid gland in patients with AIDS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F72716\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72716 \">table 1</a>). Such occurrences were far more common prior to the widespread use of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART), although they may still be observed in patients not receiving ART or who have developed antiretroviral drug resistance.</p><p>The infrequency of infectious and neoplastic thyroid disease in HIV-infected patients was illustrated in a retrospective study of 102 autopsy cases in the United States from 1980 to 2007 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-gland-dysfunction-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Interstitial fibrosis and thyroid hyperplasia were the most common histologic findings (5 and 2 percent of cases, respectively), whereas infection was identified in fewer than 3 percent and Kaposi sarcoma was present in only one case.</p><p>Glandular infiltration may be suspected on clinical grounds or as the result of an imaging study (eg, ultrasound). Tissue is generally required for a definitive diagnosis. Fine-needle aspiration of the thyroid is safe, effective, and widely available. Functional testing with a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level should also be performed since thyroid dysfunction may accompany glandular infection or infiltration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ALTERATIONS IN THYROID FUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Disturbances in thyroid function can lead to hypo- or hyperthyroidism, which can be asymptomatic or clinically overt. The presentation and diagnosis of thyroid disorders is discussed in detail elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-hypothyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of and screening for hypothyroidism in nonpregnant adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of hyperthyroidism&quot;</a>). The effect of HIV infection on thyroid function is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Effects of medications'</a> below.)</p><p>Asymptomatic HIV-infected patients with stable body weight generally maintain normal thyroid function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-gland-dysfunction-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. By contrast, changes similar to those seen in non-thyroidal illness (NTI) in uninfected individuals are often present in patients with AIDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-gland-dysfunction-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. NTI is generally characterized by low to normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), low tri-iodothyronine (T3), high reverse T3 (rT3), and normal free thyroxine (T4) levels related to impaired peripheral T4 to T3 conversion and reduced rT3 clearance. Low T3 levels in NTI may be adaptive by lowering metabolic rate and decreasing protein catabolism in the setting of systemic illness or reduced caloric intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-gland-dysfunction-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroid-function-in-nonthyroidal-illness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thyroid function in nonthyroidal illness&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, T3 levels are often higher and rT3 levels lower in AIDS patients than expected for NTI, raising concern that these protective effects may be compromised [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-gland-dysfunction-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The difference in T3 levels is not explained by the increased levels of thyroid hormone-binding globulin (TBG) seen in HIV-infected individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-gland-dysfunction-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Reduction in T3 levels are sometimes observed in AIDS patients with opportunistic infections and anorexia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-gland-dysfunction-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1207792289\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence of thyroid dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several cross-sectional studies of HIV-infected patients suggest that the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction is high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-gland-dysfunction-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/8-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-13</a>]. One multicenter study of 350 HIV-infected patients reported a 16 percent prevalence of hypothyroidism, although there was no uninfected control group for comparison [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-gland-dysfunction-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The risk of hypothyroidism was increased among patients with lower CD4 counts. Symptoms ranged from overt hypothyroidism (2.6 percent) to subclinical disease (6.6 percent) to an isolated low free T4 level (6.8 percent).</p><p>In another study of newly diagnosed HIV-infected patients with advanced immunodeficiency (71 percent had a CD4 count &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL),</span> the overall prevalence of thyroid dysfunction was 76 percent compared with 16 percent among a control group of healthy volunteers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-gland-dysfunction-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Subclinical hypothyroidism was again the most common abnormality, affecting almost 53 percent of patients. Thyroid dysfunction correlated with declining CD4 counts. In clinical practice, however, many of these patients probably do not require treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subclinical-hypothyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subclinical hypothyroidism in nonpregnant adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Effects of medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thyroid dysfunction is more frequent in patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) compared with ART-na&iuml;ve patients, usually manifesting as hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-gland-dysfunction-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. One study of 410 HIV-infected patients reported that increased TSH was associated with ART duration and nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-gland-dysfunction-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Another cross-sectional study of 117 HIV-infected patients reported a fourfold risk of subclinical hypothyroidism among those who had a history of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stavudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">stavudine</a> (older NRTI) use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-gland-dysfunction-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>By increasing clearance of thyroid hormone, some medications (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ritonavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ritonavir</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a>) can precipitate clinical hypothyroidism in HIV-infected patients with marginal thyroid reserve. Patients on thyroid replacement therapy may also require higher doses in this setting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1039878627\"><span class=\"h2\">Effects of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When potent ART leads to immune reconstitution, autoimmune thyroid diseases can result from the production of new immune cells targeting thyroid antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-gland-dysfunction-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Such patients typically present with symptoms and signs of Graves' disease one to two years after beginning ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-gland-dysfunction-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. These patients generally have low or undetectable viral loads and no preexisting thyroid disease. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome can also lead to development of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which may explain reports suggesting an increased prevalence of hypothyroidism among patients on ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-gland-dysfunction-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/8,9,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSMENT OF THYROID FUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The changes in thyroid function tests described above usually do not require treatment and must be interpreted in their appropriate clinical context. If an HIV-infected patient presents with typical symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> signs of hypo- or hyperthyroidism (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism in adults&quot;</a>), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) should be the initial laboratory test ordered. If the TSH is normal, but there is still reason to suspect secondary (pituitary) hypothyroidism, then a free T4 should also be checked. Even though some studies have reported increased prevalence of hypothyroidism in HIV-infected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-gland-dysfunction-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], we do not suggest routine screening in this population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3323442663\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2742593018\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypothyroidism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with AIDS or wasting who are diagnosed with symptomatic hypothyroidism, we initially prescribe a low dose of thyroid replacement hormone (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levothyroxine</a> 25 to 50 mcg daily) with gradual upward titration and monitoring of thyroid function tests.
