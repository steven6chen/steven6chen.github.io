Bladder infections are more common than kidney infections. Bladder infections happen when bacteria get into the urethra and travel up into the bladder. Kidney infections happen when the bacteria travel even higher, up into the kidneys. Both bladder and kidney infections are more common in women than men.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H294739489\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a bladder infection?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain or a burning feeling when you urinate</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The need to urinate often</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The need to urinate suddenly or in a hurry</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood in the urine</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32947137\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a kidney infection?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms of a kidney infection can include the symptoms of a bladder infection, but kidney infections can also cause:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Back pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea or vomiting</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H294739496\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I find out if I have a urinary tract infection?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse. He or she will probably be able to tell if you have a urinary tract infection just by learning about your symptoms and doing a simple urine test. If your doctor or nurse thinks you might have a kidney infection or is unsure what you have, he or she might also do a more involved urine test to check for bacteria.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H294739503\"><span class=\"h1\">How are urinary tract infections treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most urinary tract infections are treated with antibiotic pills. These pills work by killing the germs that cause the infection.</p><p>If you have a bladder infection, you will probably need to take antibiotics for 3 to 7 days. If you have a kidney infection, you will probably need to take antibiotics for longer &ndash; maybe for up to 2 weeks. If you have a kidney infection, it's also possible you will need to be treated in the hospital.</p><p>Your symptoms should begin to improve within a day of starting antibiotics. But you should finish all the antibiotic pills you get. Otherwise your infection might come back.</p><p>If needed, you can also take a medicine to numb your bladder. This medicine eases the pain caused by urinary tract infections. It also reduces the need to urinate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H294739510\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I get bladder infections a lot?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>First, check with your doctor or nurse to make sure that you are really having bladder infections. The symptoms of bladder infection can be caused by other things. Your doctor or nurse will want to see if those problems might be causing your symptoms.</p><p>But if you are really dealing with repeated infections, there are things you can do to keep from getting more infections. You can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Find a new method of birth control, if you use spermicides (sperm-killing creams). Using spermicides &ndash; especially with a diaphragm &ndash; seems to promote bladder infections in some women.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drink more fluid. There is no proof that this helps, but many doctors suggest doing it. It might help flush out germs, and it does no harm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinate right after sex. Some doctors think this helps, because it helps flush out germs that might get into the bladder during sex. There is no proof it works, but it also cannot hurt.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ask your doctor or nurse about vaginal estrogen, if you are a woman who has been through menopause. Vaginal estrogen comes in a cream or a flexible ring that you put into your vagina. It can help prevent bladder infections.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H294739517\"><span class=\"h1\">Can cranberry juice or other cranberry products prevent bladder infections?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The studies suggesting that cranberry products prevent bladder infections are not very good. Other studies suggest that cranberry products do not prevent bladder infections. But if you want to try cranberry products for this purpose, there is probably not much harm in doing so.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H294739524\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-in-the-urine-hematuria-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Blood in the urine (hematuria) in adults (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-in-adolescents-and-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Urinary tract infections in adolescents and adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Urinary tract infections in children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
