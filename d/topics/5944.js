They are associated with general risk factors for atherosclerotic disease, including age, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, and are more common in patients with coronary artery disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Aortic atherosclerotic plaques are an important source of emboli, leading to cerebral (eg, transient ischemic attack, stroke), extremity, or visceral embolization (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F54250\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54250 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. Embolic events can occur spontaneously or can be induced by interventions, including cardiac catheterization, arteriography, peripheral interventions, intraaortic balloon pumping, and cardiac or vascular surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. </p><p>The general manifestations and treatment of cholesterol crystal embolism, diagnosis, and medical and surgical management will be reviewed. Thromboembolism from unstable aortic plaques is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=embolism-from-aortic-plaque-thromboembolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Embolism from aortic plaque: Thromboembolism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Specific considerations related to end-organ ischemia (kidney, gut, extremity) that may result from cholesterol crystal embolus are discussed in separate topic reviews. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5888108\"><span class=\"h1\">ATHEROEMBOLISM VERSUS THROMBOEMBOLISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two types of emboli originate from atherosclerotic plaques: thromboemboli and atheroemboli (cholesterol crystal emboli). Although the underlying risk factors may be similar, the two can often be differentiated based upon associated conditions and clinical manifestations. This is an important distinction, since the prognosis and treatment differ. Thromboembolism from complex aortic plaques is common, particularly from thoracic aortic plaques. In comparison, cholesterol crystal embolism is fairly rare but is probably underrecognized given its diverse presentations. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=embolism-from-aortic-plaque-thromboembolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Embolism from aortic plaque: Thromboembolism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although there is some overlap, these two disorders can be distinguished from each other. Thromboembolism occurs when thrombus, which is usually superimposed on an atherosclerotic plaque, dislodges due to plaque rupture or other forces. The thromboemboli tend to be single and lodge in medium or large arteries. Thromboemboli from aortic atherosclerotic plaque most often result in transient ischemic attack or stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. Acute ischemia of the extremities, intestines, or solid organs (eg, kidney, spleen) can also occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The term cholesterol crystal embolism is used synonymously with cholesterol embolism or atheroembolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Cholesterol crystal embolism occurs when atherosclerotic plaque is disrupted and cholesterol crystals within the plaque or portions of the plaque embolize distally. The debris showers into the circulation partially or totally occluding arterioles that are &lt;200 micrometers in diameter, leading to a myriad of occlusions that typically affect multiple organs. These characteristic sizes of atheroemboli were illustrated in an experimental study using human aortorenal endarterectomy specimens. Following ex vivo &quot;angioplasty&quot; of these specimens, thousands of fragments 20 to 40 micrometers in size, the approximate size of the human afferent arteriole, and hundreds &gt;100 micrometers in size, were collected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cholesterol embolization is most likely to occur in the male patient &gt;50 years of age, with risk factors for atherosclerosis following cardiac catheterization or a vascular procedure. Cholesterol crystal embolism is strongly associated with older age, with the average age being 66 years in a review of 221 published cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Lighter-skinned individuals may be more often affected, but it is more likely that subtle skin manifestations are not recognized in patients with darker skin tones. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Skin'</a> below.)</p><p>The incidence and prevalence of cholesterol crystal embolism are unknown. The published estimates are limited by suboptimal or unclear diagnostic criteria (such as solely relying on elevation of serum creatinine concentration after a procedure) and infrequent biopsy data. The full manifestations of the syndrome are probably rare. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p>Cholesterol crystal embolization may arise spontaneously or as the result of instrumentation of the vasculature (eg, cardiac catheterization, arteriography, vascular surgery). The following observations are from some of the studies that have evaluated the incidence or prevalence of cholesterol crystal embolism:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a review of 519 patients with extensive thoracic aortic plaque on transesophageal echocardiography, cholesterol crystal embolism occurred in 1 percent of patients during a follow-up of more than three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 1011 patients who underwent infrarenal aortic and infrainguinal vascular surgery or angiographic manipulation, clinical and pathologic evidence of cholesterol crystal embolism was found in 2.9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower rates are seen after cardiac surgery (0.2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In a prospective observational study of 1786 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, definite cholesterol crystal embolism was observed in 0.8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective review of 493 patients who underwent aortoiliac stent placements, 72 bilateral, the incidence of atheroembolism was 1.6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p>Many cases of cholesterol crystal embolism are not recognized clinically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. This issue was addressed in a prospective study of 60 patients with an acute myocardial infarction, one-half of whom were treated with thrombolytic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. All patients underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) within one month, and two muscle biopsy specimens and one skin biopsy specimen were obtained at the time of surgery. Seven patients (12 percent) had pathologic evidence of cholesterol crystal emboli in the muscle biopsy specimens, only one of whom had clinically evident disease. </p><p>This finding of asymptomatic disease is consistent with the prevalence of cholesterol crystal embolism in autopsy studies in unselected patients that range from 0.7 to 4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/15,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,20</a>]. Even higher rates of cholesterol embolization (up to 75 percent) are reported in retrospective autopsy studies in patients selected for atherosclerotic risk factors or following surgery or instrumentation, but these studies may overestimate the incidence of cholesterol crystal embolism due to selection bias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>In addition to asymptomatic disease, it is probable that clinical manifestations of cholesterol crystal embolism are ascribed to other causes. This may be most likely with acute renal failure, where acute kidney injury is much more common than cholesterol crystal embolism, which will not be diagnosed unless tissue is available for pathology if there are no other manifestations of this syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Renal'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5888585\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors for aortic atherosclerosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for developing cholesterol crystal embolism are largely those associated with developing general atherosclerotic disease such as smoking, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, obesity, and diabetes. The data supporting these associations are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-disease-risk-assessment-for-primary-prevention-our-approach\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular disease risk assessment for primary prevention: Our approach&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The &quot;classic&quot; risk factors of hypertension, age, and smoking have been correlated with severe atherosclerotic plaque in the thoracic aorta. This relationship was demonstrated with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in a population-based study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Among those with aortic plaque, the odds of having complex plaque increased as systolic blood pressure increased (odds ratio [OR] 1.43 for each 10 mmHg increase, 95% CI 1.10-1.87). Complex aortic plaque also correlated with hypertension treatment, controlling for age and history of smoking.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors for embolization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of cholesterol crystal embolization is directly related to the severity of atherosclerosis. Any factor that destabilizes atherosclerotic plaque can result in cholesterol crystal embolism. Embolization may be spontaneous or iatrogenic precipitated by vascular manipulation during arteriography or surgery. It was previously estimated that 50 to 60 percent of cases of cholesterol crystal embolization were spontaneous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/14,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,24</a>]. However, the increasing frequency of endovascular manipulations (eg, coronary, aortoiliac, renal) has increased the incidence of iatrogenic embolization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. In one retrospective review, spontaneous embolism occurred in only 25 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>Abdominal aortic aneurysms are a known source of cholesterol emboli. In a prospective study of 660 patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm that were followed for 1 to 60 months (mean 15 months), cholesterol crystal embolization was diagnosed in 2.9 percent of the patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm#H181175588\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Limb ischemia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1503780\"><span class=\"h3\">Plaque characteristics and location</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of cholesterol crystal embolism in patients with aortic atherosclerosis is markedly increased if transesophageal echocardiography reveals protruding plaques, particularly if &ge;4 mm in thickness; ulceration; or superimposed mobile thrombi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/5,9,28-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9,28-32</a>]. </p><p>A correlation between complex plaque seen on two-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (2D-TEE) and embolization phenomena was first noted in 1990 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Subsequent 2D-TEE studies found that complex plaques may give rise to either cholesterol crystal emboli or thromboemboli (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F63285\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63285 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F57210\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef57210 \">movie 1</a>). In a few case reports, cholesterol crystal embolism to the skin and kidneys was proven by biopsy in patients with complex plaques in the descending thoracic aorta on 2D-TEE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. In another report, transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated mobile particulate matter in transit from a complex plaque in a patient who subsequently died after multisystem involvement from cholesterol crystal embolism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64740\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64740 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Plaque in the aortic arch is implicated as a risk factor for cerebral embolization. However, data are conflicting. In longitudinal population-based studies in nonselected individuals, complex aortic atherosclerosis does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of primary stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>However, most reports evaluating secondary stroke risk have found that complex aortic atherosclerosis is a risk factor for recurrent stroke. This may be due to selection bias as the studies linking aortic atheroma and secondary stroke were usually performed in patients referred for TEE to evaluate a cardiac source of emboli rather than in a random population sample. </p><p>Mechanistically, aortic plaque may be both a source of cerebral emboli and a marker of generalized atherosclerosis. Studies of aortic arch plaque have found a 12 to 14 percent risk of cerebral embolization, particularly when the plaque is ulcerated or mobile. On the other hand, aortic plaque may be a marker of aging, and age is an independent predictor of cerebrovascular events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Atherosclerotic plaque in the thoracic aorta is typically associated with distal embolization (abdominal organs, lower extremities). However, retrograde flow from complex descending thoracic aortic plaques may be a source of cranial or upper extremity embolization. In a study of 94 patients using transesophageal echocardiography, retrograde diastolic flow reached the left subclavian artery in 60 percent, the left common carotid artery in 26 percent, and the brachiocephalic trunk in 14 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>The abdominal aorta and iliac arteries are commonly identified as a source for lower extremity cholesterol crystal embolization. In one surgical series of 62 patients, the aorta or iliac arteries were identified angiographically as the embolic source in 80 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p>Atherosclerotic plaque in the femoral, popliteal, or subclavian arteries may also be a source of extremity embolization. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1503787\"><span class=\"h3\">Instrumentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Iatrogenic embolism is typically due to vascular manipulation during arteriography or surgery. Surgical procedures may disrupt atherosclerotic plaque as vessels are dissected, cross-clamped, or as an arteriotomy is made. Trauma is an unusual cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Arteriography is a more common iatrogenic cause than surgery, accounting for as many as 85 percent of iatrogenic cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The source of the emboli in a review of 29 patients was the abdominal aorta (16 patients), iliac arteries (7 patients) and femoropopliteal arteries (6 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis often have diffuse atherosclerosis and are at a relatively high risk for cholesterol crystal embolism after renal arteriography, with an overall incidence of approximately 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>The effect of arterial manipulation has been illustrated in several studies. In a prospective series of 1000 patients who underwent percutaneous coronary interventions, guiding catheter placement was associated with visible scraping of debris from the walls of the aorta in more than one-half of the patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Clinical cholesterol crystal embolism was not seen, however, as ischemic events were not associated with visualization of debris in the catheter. Similarly, with renal artery angioplasty with stenting, grossly visible material (cholesterol crystals, atheromatous material and thrombus) are found in the embolic protection filter in 45 to 60 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, evaluation, and treatment of renal atheroemboli&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1503824\"><span class=\"h3\">Anticoagulation/thrombolytic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cholesterol crystal embolism has been reported after the use of thrombolytic agents or anticoagulants (primarily heparin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>). However, a causal relationship between the use of these medications and cholesterol crystal embolism has not been established, and, based on available evidence, the overall risk appears to be low. </p><p>In the 40 years since the introduction of thrombolytic therapy, a total of 30 cases as a complication of thrombolysis have been reported; 28 patients received a thrombolytic agent for acute myocardial infarction and 2 patients for deep venous thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. These case reports gave the impression that there might be a causal relationship between thrombolysis and cholesterol crystal embolism. However, there is no evidence to suggest that lysis of thrombus overlying atherosclerotic plaque leads to plaque destabilization and atheroembolism. There are no large-scale clinical trials that specifically addressed the issue of cholesterol crystal embolism in the setting of thrombolytic therapy. One small study of 60 patients found no differences in the rate of cholesterol crystal embolism between the patients who received thrombolysis and those who did not. The presence or absence of cholesterol crystal embolism in this study was based upon skin and muscle biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, given the low incidence of embolism and the small number of patients in the study, a significant difference may not have been detectable.</p><p>Cholesterol crystal embolism has also been blamed on therapy with anticoagulant drugs, particularly heparin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, with plaque hemorrhage as the putative precipitating factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. However, it is unclear if cholesterol crystal embolism was caused by anticoagulants or it simply occurred in patients who happened to be on anticoagulation therapy. Trials that have randomly assigned patients with documented aortic plaque identified by transesophageal echocardiography to anticoagulant therapy have not identified an increased risk for atheroembolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/13,16,45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16,45,46</a>]. Thus, the putative risk associated with anticoagulation therapy appears to be low. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The variability in clinical manifestation is related to the location of the embolic source, extent of embolization, whether there is partial or complete occlusion of the affected vessels, and the presence or absence of preexisting disease in the affected vascular bed (eg, peripheral artery disease).</p><p>Atheroemboli from the aortic arch typically embolize to the brain, eye, or upper extremity while descending thoracic or abdominal aortic plaque causes gastrointestinal or lower extremity symptoms and signs. Retrograde embolization from the thoracic aorta can also occur. (See <a href=\"#H1503780\" class=\"local\">'Plaque characteristics and location'</a> above.)</p><p>The presenting symptoms of cholesterol crystal embolism may be subtle and nonspecific. As an example, 21 percent of patients in a review of 221 cases presented with systemic symptoms of fever, myalgias, headache, and weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Often there is a delay between the embolic event and subsequent symptoms. In a review of histologically proven cholesterol embolization, skin signs developed more than 30 days after a precipitating event in 50 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>More dramatic clinical presentations are generally due to a diffuse showering of larger, atheromatous debris originating from usually aortic plaque.

Secondary prevention seems warranted, particularly since aortic plaques &ge;4 mm in size appear to be associated with an increased risk of recurrent stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/6,94,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,94,95</a>]. In patients whose cholesterol embolization syndrome was precipitated by instrumentation (such as arteriography, cardiac catheterization or vascular surgery), any further invasive imaging or treatment should be avoided unless absolutely necessary. Noninvasive ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should replace the invasive techniques whenever possible. When arterial cannulation is absolutely necessary, alternative access routes should be considered (eg, cardiac catheterization via radial artery approach in a patient with extensive plaques in the descending thoracic aorta). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1506317\"><span class=\"h3\">Lipid-lowering therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Statin therapy may decrease the risk of future embolization. Statins lower LDL cholesterol and have a variety of other effects, one of which appears to be plaque stabilization. In a retrospective study of 519 patients with severe thoracic aortic plaque cited, statin therapy was associated with a significantly lower rate of recurrent stroke and thromboembolization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, the number of patients with atheroembolization was too small (five) for subset analysis. On multivariate analysis, the protective effect seen with statin therapy was not present for patients taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> or antiplatelet agents.

Although it seems intuitive that anticoagulation would improve arterial patency, the obstruction is mostly due to the atheroembolic debris and the inflammatory reaction it incites, and not thrombus. Another important consideration is the association between anticoagulant and antithrombotic therapy and the development of cholesterol crystal embolism; however, due to paucity of data, a causal relationship between cholesterol crystal embolism and anticoagulation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thrombolytic therapy can be neither proven nor refuted with certainty. (See <a href=\"#H1503824\" class=\"local\">'Anticoagulation/thrombolytic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p>There are no randomized trials that have evaluated the role of antithrombotic therapy in patients with aortic atheroma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/94,97\" class=\"abstract_t\">94,97</a>]. Nonrandomized retrospective studies have shown a benefit of oral anticoagulation over <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> in patients with mobile thrombi in the aortic arch. Based on this low-quality evidence, the 2012 American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines panel suggested oral anticoagulation or antiplatelet agents for patients with cryptogenic stroke and mobile aortic arch thrombi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>].

Other studies have not shown a benefit to anticoagulation. In a retrospective review of 519 patients with complex plaque, cholesterol crystal embolism occurred in only five (1 percent) during a follow-up of more than three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The risk was similar in the patients treated (2 of 206) and not treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> (3 of 313). This rate is similar to that noted in the Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation (SPAF-III) trial (1 of 134 warfarin-treated patients), most of whom had severe atherosclerotic plaques on transesophageal echocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].</p><p>In our practice, we do not routinely use anticoagulants in patients who are diagnosed with cholesterol crystal embolism unless they have other indications for anticoagulation (such as atrial fibrillation or mechanical prosthetic valve).

Cholesterol crystal embolism results in partial or total occlusion of small arteries, leading to tissue or organ ischemia. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors for atheroembolism include patient factors such as hypertension, advancing age, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, and diabetes. Anatomic factors associated with the aortic atherosclerotic plaque, such as plaque thickness &ge;4 mm, plaque ulceration, or the presence of mobile debris, increase the risk for embolization. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical diagnosis of cholesterol crystal embolism should be suspected in patients with known atherosclerotic disease and the development of renal failure; transient ischemic attack; cerebral infarction; signs of intestinal ischemia; digital ischemia; typical skin findings or Hollenhorst plaques in the retina, particularly following arteriography; cardiac catheterization; vascular surgery; or trauma to the abdomen. The diagnosis is more difficult in patients who do not have these features, particularly if cholesterol crystal embolism has occurred spontaneously. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of complex aortic plaque on imaging studies supports the diagnosis. Atherosclerotic plaques can also be seen using transthoracic echocardiography, abdominal ultrasound, and endoscopic ultrasound of the upper gastrointestinal tract. (See <a href=\"#H5888663\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory testing is generally nonspecific but may indicate the effects of end-organ ischemia. A definitive diagnosis depends upon pathologic specimens. Biopsy should be performed whenever the diagnosis is in doubt and when the specimen can safely be obtained from the patient; debrided or amputated tissue and thrombectomy specimens should be sent for pathologic examination since these represent no risk to the patient. The histologic hallmark of cholesterol crystal embolism is the presence of &quot;ghosts&quot; of cholesterol crystals or cholesterol clefts within arterioles. (See <a href=\"#H5889574\" class=\"local\">'Biopsy and pathologic findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment of cholesterol crystal embolism is primarily medical, consisting of risk factor reduction. Statin therapy is indicated as part of risk factor reduction and appears to reduce the rate of recurrent embolism. (See <a href=\"#H1506317\" class=\"local\">'Lipid-lowering therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical or endovascular treatment may be indicated if a clear embolic source is identified, the source is anatomically suitable, and the patient is an appropriate candidate for surgery. For patients who meet these criteria, we suggest surgical or endovascular treatment to remove or exclude the embolic source (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest <strong>not</strong> routinely anticoagulating patients who are diagnosed with cholesterol crystal embolism (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Anticoagulation with heparin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, and use of thrombolytic therapy are all associated with the development of cholesterol embolism, although a causal relationship has never been demonstrated. However, patients with another indication for anticoagulation, such as thromboembolism or deep vein thrombosis, should be treated.
