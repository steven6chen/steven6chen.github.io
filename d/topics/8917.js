AA can result from either inherited or acquired causes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F52354\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52354 \">table 1</a>). The incidence is triphasic, with one peak in childhood at two to five years (due to inherited causes), and two peaks in adulthood, 20 to 25 years and the majority of patients presenting beyond 55 to 60 years of age (typically due to acquired causes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The associated neutropenia and thrombocytopenia can lead to potentially life-threatening infections and bleeding. Chronic red cell transfusion therapy for the associated anemia can lead iron overload, which, if not treated, can lead to significant morbidity and mortality.</p><p>The majority of children (75 percent) with inherited bone marrow failure have an identifiable etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].

Acquired AA, which accounts for most cases of AA in children, is a disorder that often responds to immunosuppressive therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70072\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70072 \">table 2</a>). In contrast, immunosuppressive therapy is not indicated in the inherited syndromes. A few cases of aplastic anemia in patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia have also been reported.

They include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemorrhagic manifestations secondary to thrombocytopenia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fatigue and pallor caused by progressive anemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever, mucosal ulcerations, and bacterial infections resulting from neutropenia</p><p/><p>In addition, some of the inherited disorders of AA often are associated with characteristic congenital malformations <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> extrahematologic manifestations. Although the presence of physical findings provides important clues to the underlying diagnosis of inherited marrow failure, their absence does not rule out an inherited marrow failure syndrome, as many patients with inherited marrow failure syndromes fail to manifest classical physical findings. </p><p>The complete blood count (CBC) generally shows decreased cell counts in one or more blood cell lines. For children with inherited AA, the initial CBC findings may be mildly abnormal and involve only one cell line, particularly early in life. We suggest that children be evaluated by a pediatric hematologist if they have persistent or progressive unexplained cytopenias, particularly when associated with macrocytosis, involvement of two or more cell lines, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> associated with short stature or other physical findings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of AA is established by bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. The characteristic findings of AA include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The bone marrow is profoundly hypocellular with a decrease in all hematopoietic elements; the marrow space is predominantly composed of fat cells, lymphocytes, and marrow stroma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66353\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66353 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71042\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71042 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The residual hematopoietic cells are not malignant. Inherited marrow failure syndromes often manifest dysplastic features such as hyponucleated small megakaryocytes, multinucleated red cells, or hypolobulated and hypogranular myeloid cells. Lymphocytes may be the predominant white cell present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malignant infiltrates are absent.</p><p/><p>Once the diagnosis of AA is confirmed by biopsy, the patient should undergo a detailed evaluation for possible precipitating factors or causes of AA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53126\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53126 \">table 3</a>). This includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Review of the history including a history of exposure to medications or toxin and a family history of cytopenias, congenital anomalies, or cancer predisposition. Excessive toxicity to chemotherapy or radiation may provide a clue to the underlying diagnosis of an inherited marrow failure syndrome. Either a personal or family history of pulmonary fibrosis or unexplained liver disease suggests the possibility of dyskeratosis congenita (DC). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Review of prior complete blood counts (CBCs) is important. For example, a history of thrombocytopenia as a neonate, even if transiently resolved, suggests the possibility of congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (CAMT).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical examination looking for dysmorphic features, congenital anomalies, or mucocutaneous features associated with specific inherited AA or signs of other causes of pancytopenia, such as infections, malignancies, or rheumatologic disorders.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serologic testing for viruses associated with AA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum B12 and erythrocyte folate levels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests for specific causes of AA, important for all pediatric patients, should be performed and include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Chromosomal breakage testing with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitomycin</a> C (MMC) or diepoxybutane (DEB) screening to detect Fanconi anemia (FA) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fanconi-anemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Fanconi anemia&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Telomere length measurements <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mutation testing for DC (see <a href=\"#H3253220814\" class=\"local\">'Dyskeratosis congenita'</a> below)</p><p/><p>If an inherited form of marrow failure (FA, DC, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome [SDS], or CAMT) is diagnosed, genetic testing is recommended for all siblings of the proband because early diagnosis critically impacts clinical management, allows for early intervention, and impacts donor selection for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">AMEGAKARYOCYTIC THROMBOCYTOPENIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (CAMT, <a href=\"http://omim.org/entry/604498&amp;token=O25AxH2ZrpTPG8o+GEGTWKF8yFndb22Wq6+OlGXZLb9bTkyr+nqYLzEpy/FlK+CS&amp;TOPIC_ID=5922\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">MIM #604498</a>) is a rare disorder characterized by isolated thrombocytopenia in infancy and absent or reduced megakaryocytes in the bone marrow without birth defects characteristic of other inherited bone marrow failure syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>CAMT is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and is associated with mutations in the myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene, MPL, which encodes the thrombopoietin receptor, c-MPL, and is an essential regulator of megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>].

In a retrospective analysis from a single center of 20 children between 1990 and 2002, all patients with CAMT were noted to have purpura and petechiae shortly after birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In addition, intracranial hemorrhage was reported in two affected neonates following vaginal delivery. No skeletal abnormalities were detected in any of the patients. Two children had cardiac abnormalities and six had poor growth. In addition, cerebral malformations were detected, some of which may represent sequelae of prior intrauterine intracranial hemorrhage.</p><p>Pancytopenia develops in later childhood at a median age of 3.7 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,15,16</a>]. A subset of patients experience a transient rise in platelet counts and later onset pancytopenia. In the previously mentioned study, pancytopenia developed in 14 patients at a median age of 38 months (range 6 to 53 months), and one patient had isolated thrombocytopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Patients with CAMT are at high risk for developing severe aplastic anemia. Although there are no reported cases of myelodysplasia (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in patients with CAMT with documented MPL mutations, one study found one case of monosomy 7 and one case of trisomy 8 evolving over time in a cohort of five children with MPL mutation-positive CAMT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In each of these children, the clonal changes were detected when AA had developed. Thus, the use of hematopoietic cell transplantation for CAMT may mask an increased risk of <span class=\"nowrap\">MDS/AML</span> in these patients. </p><p>CAMT is not associated with skeletal abnormalities, which differentiates this disorder from the thrombocytopenia associated with absent radii [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In addition, other causes of decreased platelet production in the neonate must be considered including Fanconi anemia and chromosomal defects associated with neonatal thrombocytopenia. Patients with chromosomal defects who may present with neonatal thrombocytopenia include trisomies 21, 18, and 13, and Turner syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of neonatal thrombocytopenia&quot;, section on 'Decreased production'</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of CAMT can be made in cases with mutations of the MPL gene. However, the finding of MPL gene mutations is not required for CAMT because there are reports of patients with the characteristic clinical and laboratory findings of CAMT who do not have a MPL gene mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Patients with mutations that result in absence of c-MPL protein have earlier onset bone marrow failure compared with those patients with mutations that result in amino acid substitutions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Homozygous MPL mutations have been reported in a few kindreds with familial aplastic anemia, but without the history of preceding thrombocytopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. It is unclear whether these kindreds represent a subtype of CAMT. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants and children with CAMT are at risk for life-threatening hemorrhages secondary to thrombocytopenia. Although platelet transfusions are effective, the benefits must be weighed against the risk of allosensitization, which increases the incidence of graft rejection in patients who subsequently undergo hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). As a result, platelet transfusion is generally reserved for symptomatic patients or those who have a high risk of bleeding. Given the potential need for HCT, directed donor transfusions from family members are contraindicated due to the risk of allosensitization. Children with CAMT do not respond to thrombopoietin therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>HCT is the only curative option for children with CAMT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/15,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,20-22</a>]. In a 2005 report of 20 patients with CAMT, 15 patients received HCT at a median age of 38 months (range 7 to 89 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The four patients who received matched unrelated stem cell transplants all died. Of the patients transplanted with a HLA-identical or HLA-haploidentical parent or sibling, one died and another developed graft failure and subsequently underwent a second successful HCT from his haploidentical mother. Among the five patients who did not undergo HCT, one patient died from bleeding complications and another from acute myeloid leukemia. A 2015 series of five children who underwent HCT using unrelated donor umbilical cord blood reported excellent outcomes, with all patients alive and disease-free with full donor chimerism at a median of 14 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Successful HCT from unrelated donors using a reduced intensity conditioning regimen also has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3254301408\"><span class=\"h1\">FANCONI ANEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by pancytopenia, predisposition to malignancy, and physical abnormalities including short stature, microcephaly, developmental delay, caf&eacute;-au-lait skin lesions, and malformations belonging to the VACTERL-H association. Diagnosis is usually made in childhood, although diagnostic delays and variable disease manifestations are common and some individuals may not be diagnosed with FA until adulthood. </p><p>Determining whether FA is the cause of bone marrow failure has important implications for management, because individuals with FA require increased surveillance for hematologic and non-hematologic malignancies and other organ dysfunction, and dramatically reduced doses of chemotherapy for treating malignancies and in the preparative regimen for HCT. Additionally, the presence of FA must be confirmed or excluded when evaluating siblings as HCT donors, so that the patient does not receive hematopoietic stem cells from a sibling with FA. </p><p>The diagnosis and management of FA are discussed in detail separately.
