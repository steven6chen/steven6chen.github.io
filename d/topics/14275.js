This topic will review current and planned efforts to prevent type 1 diabetes. Subjects who are at high risk for type 1 diabetes can be identified using a combination of immune, genetic, and metabolic markers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prediction of type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the current classification of diabetes, immune-mediated type 1 diabetes is called type 1A to distinguish it from less common cases in which an autoimmune etiology cannot be determined (type 1B); the latter are said to be idiopathic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The term type 1 diabetes used here refers to type 1A, or autoimmune diabetes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-diabetes-mellitus-and-genetic-diabetic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of diabetes mellitus and genetic diabetic syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION AND REVERSAL STRATEGIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory agents and other drugs have been given either alone or in combination to decrease the immune-mediated destruction of beta cells that occurs in type 1 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Most of the studies have been performed in recent-onset diabetes, where the majority of beta-cell function has already been lost, and the anticipated outcome is preservation of remaining beta-cell function, usually measured as area under the curve (AUC) insulin secretion in response to stimulation. Many of the studies involve small numbers of patients and are uncontrolled.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunomodulators</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Azathioprine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Azathioprine</a> is an immunosuppressive drug that inhibits or prevents T cell responses to antigens. In one randomized, double-blind study of 46 patients treated with azathioprine and glucocorticoids, insulin could be discontinued in 10 of 20 treated patients as compared with 2 of 20 patients in the placebo group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Endogenous insulin secretion (measured as the plasma C-peptide response to a liquid meal) also improved. However, only three treated patients remained in remission at one year. Equally discouraging results were noted in a second study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Mycophenolate mofetil</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Mycophenolate</a> mofetil (MMF) inhibits proliferation of both T- and B-lymphocytes. In a multicenter, randomized trial, 126 patients with type 1 diabetes for less than three months were randomly assigned to MMF, MMF plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=daclizumab-withdrawn-from-market-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">daclizumab</a> (an anti-interleukin [IL]-2 receptor monoclonal antibody that selectively binds the IL-2 receptor, inhibiting IL-2-mediated T-lymphocyte proliferation), or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. After two years, there was no significant difference in the mean AUC for C-peptide levels during a mixed-meal tolerance test. Thus, neither MMF alone nor in combination with daclizumab slowed progression of beta-cell destruction in recently diagnosed type 1 diabetes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Cyclosporine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Large-scale trials in patients with recently diagnosed type 1 diabetes in Canada and France showed that remissions were twice as common in the cyclosporine-treated patients as compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Although the remissions also lasted longer, almost all patients required insulin again within three years. An analysis of subjects recruited into the Canadian-European <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> trial showed that subjects who were insulinoma-associated 2 molecule (IA-2) negative at entry to the trial were more likely to respond to cyclosporine (with a decrease in insulin requirements and an increase in C-peptide secretion) than IA-2-positive subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Anti-CD3 antibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of mice with an anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (OKT3) reverses diabetes in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice (a model in which spontaneous autoimmunity and pancreatic islet destruction occur) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, OKT3 use is problematic in humans because of significant cytokine-mediated (tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNFa]) side effects. Humanized monoclonal antibodies have been developed, which appear to have fewer major adverse effects (fever, headache, hypotension). These antibodies have been successfully used for the treatment of acute renal allograft rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] and psoriatic arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The mechanism of action of this drug is not completely clear. Alterations in the number and function of regulatory T cells may contribute to the generation of an autoimmune state in type 1 diabetes. Dysfunction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> loss of CD1-restricted T cells, T cells with <span class=\"nowrap\">g/d</span> receptors, <span class=\"nowrap\">CD4+/CD25+</span> T cells, and NKT cells may all theoretically contribute to disease pathogenesis through inefficient suppression of pathogenic autoreactive T cells. The antigens that activate regulatory T cells are unknown, and the mechanisms by which these cells exert their effect on immune responses remain unclear. It has been postulated that hOKT3g may affect the dynamics of regulatory T cell populations, such as selective deletion of activated Th1 cells <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> activation of Th2 cells and their protective cytokines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14924002\"><span class=\"h4\">Teplizumab</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A monoclonal antibody, termed hOKT3gl (Ala-Ala) (teplizumab), contains the binding region of OKT3 in which the CH2 region has been modified by site-directed mutagenesis to alter FcR-binding activity. In a study of patients with new-onset diabetes (less than six weeks since diagnosis) randomly assigned either to infusions of teplizumab for 14 days (using increasing doses) or no treatment, insulin production was maintained for one year in 9 of 12 patients in the treatment group and only 2 of 12 patients in the control group (p = 0.01) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Glycated hemoglobin (A1C) values and insulin doses were lower in the treatment group. Side effects included fever, anemia, and rash in most patients who received anti-CD3 antibody.</p><p>In a two-year trial, 516 patients (aged 8 to 35 years) with type 1 diabetes duration &le;12 weeks were randomly assigned to receive one of three regimens of teplizumab (14-day full dose, 14-day low dose, or six-day full dose) or placebo at baseline and at six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. After one year, there was no difference in the primary composite outcome (percentage of patients with insulin use &lt;0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg/day</span> and A1C &lt;6.5 percent) among the groups (19.8, 13.7, 20.8, and 20.4 percent, respectively). Changes in AUC for C-peptide from baseline (a secondary outcome) were similar among the four groups. After two years, the 14-day, full dose regimen significantly reduced the loss of C-peptide (mean AUC) compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In predefined and post hoc subgroup analyses, C-peptide preservation was better in actively treated patients who were 8 to 17 years of age; residing in the United States; who were randomized within six weeks of diagnosis; and who had C-peptide mean AUC &gt;0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L,</span> A1C &lt;7.5 percent, and insulin dose &lt;0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg/day</span>. These findings suggest that teplizumab is most effective in preserving C-peptide secretion when administered early in the course of the disease.</p><p>In an unblinded, randomized trial targeting this patient population, 83 patients (mean age 12.5 years) diagnosed with type 1 diabetes within eight weeks of enrollment were randomly assigned to teplizumab (14-day course at baseline and one year) or no therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. After two years, preservation of C-peptide was significantly better in the teplizumab group. There was no significant difference in A1C levels, but teplizumab-treated patients required less insulin to achieve similar glycemic control. Response to teplizumab varied, and patients with better metabolic control at baseline (lower A1C levels and insulin dose at baseline) had the best response, suggesting that metabolic features may also help identify a subgroup of patients likely to respond to teplizumab.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14924010\"><span class=\"h4\">Otelixizumab</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Otelixizumab is another humanized monoclonal anti-CD3 antibody (ChAglyCD3). A multicenter trial included 80 patients with new-onset type 1 diabetes who were randomly assigned to otelixizumab for six consecutive days or placebo with the following results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At 6, 12, and 18 months, residual beta-cell function, as assessed by glucose-clamp-induced C-peptide release before and after the administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glucagon</a>, was better maintained in the anti-CD3 antibody group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insulin dose requirements increased in the placebo but not the treatment group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the subgroup of patients with initial residual beta-cell function at or above the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile of the 80 patients, mean insulin dose at 18 months was 0.22 and 0.61 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg/day</span> in the treatment and placebo groups, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administration of anti-CD3 antibody was associated with significant but transient side effects, including fever after the start of infusions and rash and acute mononucleosis-like syndrome after the end of treatment.</p><p/><p>In a follow-up report on 64 patients followed for a mean of 48 months, treatment for six days with otelixizumab appeared to have a durable effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-and-other-b-cell-targeted-therapies-for-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rituximab and other B cell targeted therapies for rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is not well studied in autoimmune diseases that have a cell-mediated pathogenesis. However, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> perhaps marks the beginning of new therapeutic strategies for type 1 diabetes, particularly if used in combination with insulin secretogogues <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other immunomodulatory agents. In a preliminary trial to determine its safety and efficacy in preserving C-peptide levels in 87 patients with new-onset type 1 diabetes, the mean AUC for C-peptide levels during a mixed-meal tolerance test was significantly higher in the rituximab versus placebo group (0.56 versus 0.47 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/mL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The clinical significance of this modest difference in the AUC is unclear. More patients in the rituximab compared with the placebo group developed side effects (eg, fever, rash, pruritus, nausea, vomiting) after the first infusion. The reactions appeared to be minimal with subsequent infusions. There was no increase in infections or neutropenia with rituximab.</p><p>The actual mechanism of the effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> in type 1 diabetes remains to be established. This drug may reduce the production of proinflammatory cytokines that enhance the immune response locally within the pancreas or the pancreatic lymph nodes. It is also possible that antigen presentation exerted by B lymphocytes, which is required for T-lymphocyte activation, is somehow affected by rituximab. Additional anti-B-lymphocyte agents, such as humanized anti-CD20 antibodies, should be tested in newly diagnosed type 1 diabetic patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-and-other-b-cell-targeted-therapies-for-rheumatoid-arthritis#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rituximab and other B cell targeted therapies for rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Other B cell depleting agents'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17495751\"><span class=\"h3\">Interleukin-1 inhibition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IL-1 is an innate immune mediator that contributes to the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes. It was hypothesized that IL-1 inhibition would therefore prevent ongoing beta-cell destruction in recent-onset type 1 diabetes. However, randomized trials assessing monotherapy with anakinra (human IL-1 receptor antagonist) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=canakinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">canakinumab</a> (a human monoclonal anti-IL-1 antibody) were not effective in maintaining beta-cell function, as measured by standard, mixed-meal-stimulated C-peptide secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Thymoglobulin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thymoglobulin or antithymocyte globulin (ATG) is used in organ transplantation, but little is known about its potential beneficial effects in type 1 diabetes.

A phase II, placebo-controlled trial is in progress; patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes will be randomly assigned to rabbit polyclonal ATG (Thymoglobulin 6.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> administered over four days) or placebo. The primary endpoint will be the presence of residual endogenous insulin secretion at 12-month follow-up.

However, in a randomized trial of a vaccine formulation of recombinant human GAD65 (GAD-alum) or subcutaneous placebo (alum alone) in newly diagnosed (within 18 months) children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes, there was no difference in fasting C-peptide concentrations or insulin requirements after 15 months, despite the fact that vaccinated children demonstrated a GAD-specific immune response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>In a similar trial, 145 patients (aged 3 to 45 years) diagnosed with type 1 diabetes within the past three months were randomly assigned to receive three doses of GAD-alum, two doses with a third placebo dose (alum alone), or three placebo doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].
