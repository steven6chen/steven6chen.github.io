Acute high-dose exposure to arsenic can cause severe systemic toxicity and death. Lower dose chronic arsenic exposure can result in subacute toxicity that can include skin changes and skin cancer, peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular effects, peripheral vascular disease, hepatotoxicity and other conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

In the office setting, clinicians may need to consider questions concerning chronic arsenic exposure in patients whose source of water is well water, exposure from food (particularly rice products), and in other environmental settings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1229512021\"><span class=\"h1\">SOURCES OF EXPOSURE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arsenic is a naturally occurring element found in the earth's crust and within numerous ores. It is classed as a metalloid because it complexes with metals; it also reacts with other elements such as oxygen, hydrogen, chlorine, carbon, and sulfur. Elemental arsenic is rare, and the element exists more commonly as organic or inorganic compounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Arsenical compounds can be grouped as inorganic, organic, and arsine gas (AsH3), and they are further classified according to their valence states: elemental (0), arsenite (trivalent, +3), and arsenate (pentavalent, +5). Trivalent arsenic or arsenite compounds, both inorganic and organic, are considered the most toxic. However, other organic forms of arsenic, found in some fish and crustaceans, as well as other foods, consisting mostly of arsenobetaine (a trimethylated arsenic compound sometime called &quot;fish arsenic&quot;) and arsenocholine, are excreted rapidly and are thought to be of negligible toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>Human exposures can occur from natural sources, such as volcanic eruptions, and arsenic leaching from soil and rocks into drinking water. Exposure can also through inhalation, usually when workers are exposed to arsenic dusts as in smelting and refining [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Inorganic arsenic levels in food are generally low, and when present, usually occur from contaminated soil-derived foods such as rice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Certain foods may contain potentially toxic levels of arsenic. Some analyses have found high levels of inorganic arsenic in hijiki (hiziki) seaweed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>Of note, arsenic is no longer produced in the United States; all of the arsenic used in the United States is imported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

In some locations, this contamination presents an enormous health hazard, as in the case of the ongoing epidemic of arsenic poisoning in West Bengal, India, and Bangladesh. High levels of arsenic leaching from natural underground sources have contaminated newly drilled wells, leading to more than one million people drinking arsenic-contaminated water (above 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/23-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-27</a>]. Thousands of people living there have been found to have arsenic-related skin lesions, liver problems, decreased motor function, and neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Although less common, there have also been case reports of arsenic poisoning from contaminated well water in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>The greater focus of the United States and other countries has been on the potential long-term adverse health outcomes from chronic exposures to much lower doses of arsenic in drinking water (below a level that causes acute clinical manifestations) that could lead to future increased risk of cancer (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Cancer'</a> below) and other health problems. To reduce the risk of cancer and other chronic effects, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) lowered the arsenic standard for drinking water from 50 parts per billion (ppb) to 10 ppb, and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has set 10 ppb for bottled water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/22,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,30</a>]. In the United States, drinking water generally contains an average of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> (2 ppb) of arsenic, although 12 percent of water supplies from surface water sources in the North Central region of the country and 12 percent of supplies from ground water sources in the Western region have levels exceeding 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> (20 ppb) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14059287\"><span class=\"h2\">Dietary ingestion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People also eat small amounts of inorganic arsenic in their diet. United States dietary intake of inorganic arsenic has been estimated to range from 1 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. There have also been concerns about elevated arsenic levels detected in some samples of apple and grape juice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The FDA performed testing from 2005 to 2011 in 160 apple juice samples from several countries, noting mild elevation of the toxic arsenic species in some samples, but the FDA has not yet set a reference range for juices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Specific source of the arsenic contamination is unclear, but concerns have been raised about arsenic residues from arsenic-containing pesticides, particularly from imported juices (banned in the United States, but still used in other countries), or contaminated water used in the preparation process. The FDA has proposed an &quot;action level&quot; of 10 parts per billion (ppb) for inorganic arsenic in apple juice (same as bottled water) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>In addition, arsenic contamination has been found in rice products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/6,7,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,33</a>]. This has raised particular concerns since rice cereal has been one of the first foods given to children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In one study, a toddler milk formula containing organic brown rice syrup as a sweetener had total arsenic concentrations of up to six times the EPA safe drinking water limit. In 2016,the FDA proposed a limit or &quot;action level&quot; of 100 ppb of inorganic arsenic found in infant rice cereal, which parallels guidance from the European Commission for rice foods for infants and young children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. These interventions to reduce early exposure to arsenic are particularly important as more information is emerging about the potential for latent effects from early-life arsenic exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p>There is evidence that inorganic arsenic may accumulate in the meat of chickens treated with a growth-promoting arsenical drug, &quot;roxarsone&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Pressure-treated wood</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wood has been preserved by pressure-treatment with pesticides including chromate copper arsenate (CCA), ammoniacal copper arsenate (ACA), and ammoniacal copper zinc arsenate (ACZA) in order to protect it from insect infestation, decay, and marine environments. In 2003, United States manufacturers began a voluntary phase-out of arsenic containing wood preservatives for wood employed in some residential uses such as play structures, picnic tables, decks, and fencing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/3,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,38</a>]. However, wood structures still exist that have CCA-treated elements.</p><p>Episodes of arsenic poisoning have been described in workers sawing the wood who were exposed to arsenic through inhalation or skin contact and in people burning arsenical-treated wood who were exposed to the arsenic-contaminated smoke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">BIOLOGICAL BASIS OF DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tasteless and odorless in soluble form, arsenic compounds are well absorbed after ingestion or inhalation. For most trivalent and pentavalent arsenical compounds dissolved in water, gastrointestinal absorption exceeds 90 percent, whereas poorly soluble compounds such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arsenic-trioxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">arsenic trioxide</a> are less well absorbed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Skin absorption is minimal acutely, but could result in low level absorption from chronic application of arsenic containing products. Arsenic can cross the placenta and accumulate in the fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Arsenic is readily taken up by red blood cells and then quickly distributed to other tissues. Peak serum levels are reached approximately 30 to 60 minutes after a single oral dose. A study of humans receiving one intravenous radioisotope of arsenic found that arsenic was cleared in three phases: Phase-I, was very rapid, in which more than 90 percent is cleared from the blood in the first two to three hours through redistribution and renal excretion; Phase-II, three hours to seven days; Phase-III, eight days or more [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/2,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,39,40</a>]. The majority of trivalent arsenic is metabolized via methylation to form monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) followed by dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) and excreted through the urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>The rapid elimination from the blood explains why blood testing is less reliable, and there is more reliance on urine testing to measure arsenic, except in cases of the earliest acute poisoning. Arsenic is initially distributed to the liver, kidney, muscle and skin, and ultimately to all tissues including the brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Arsenic also crosses the placenta and can accumulate in the fetus.</p><p>Primary target organs for toxicity are the gastrointestinal tract, skin, bone marrow, kidneys, and peripheral nervous system. Chronic ingestion of small amounts of inorganic arsenic results in the highest concentration in hair, nails, skin, and tissues rich in cysteine-containing proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/2,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,42</a>].</p><p>Trivalent arsenic (+3), the most toxic form, avidly binds to sulfhydryl groups (proteins, glutathione, cysteine) and interferes with numerous enzyme systems, such as those involving cellular respiration (inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase [PDH]), gluconeogenesis and glucose uptake, and glutathione metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Pentavalent arsenic (+5) and arsine gas are converted to trivalent arsenic in vivo, but they may also have some direct effect on uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Other mechanisms of actions are being studied to explain underlying latent disease risks (such as increased risk of cancer, disturbances of immune function) associated with early-life arsenic exposure, even at lower levels of arsenic exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. A major focus of this research is on &quot;epigenetic reprogramming,&quot; or changes to gene expression (as from DNA methylation) that ultimately lead to future increased susceptibility to develop cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL TOXICITY AND PRESENTATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute poisoning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute arsenic poisoning can occur after ingestions or, in workers, from acute inhalation exposure to high levels of arsenic dusts or fumes. Symptoms following acute, large exposures to inorganic arsenic may develop within minutes or hours. Acute toxicity typically starts in the gastrointestinal system and includes nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and severe watery diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. There may be a garlic odor of the breath and stool in severely poisoned patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. These symptoms are soon followed by dehydration, hypotension. Acute arsenic poisoning can also result in QTc prolongation with subsequent torsades de pointes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In severe cases, patients may experience cardiac arrhythmias, shock, and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and sometimes death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/2,3,5,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,5,10</a>]. In some cases, acute encephalopathy can develop and progress over several days, with delirium, coma, and seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. There have also been reports of more persistent central nervous system symptoms such as headache, confusion, and memory problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Renal injury can lead to proteinuria, hematuria, acute tubular necrosis, and anuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/10,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,45</a>].</p><p>The severity of the toxicity and symptom presentation depends upon the form and dose of the arsenic compounds. Acute oral exposure to inorganic arsenic at doses of 600 mcg per kg body weight per day or higher has resulted in death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/5,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,45</a>].</p><p>If severely poisoned individuals survive the initial illness, they usually develop hepatitis and pancytopenia within a week, and then may experience a painful sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy one to three weeks after the exposure. This has been described as beginning with distal paresthesias, followed rapidly by an ascending sensory loss and weakness, which can sometimes mimic Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/2,39,46-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,39,46-49</a>].</p><p>The blood changes are usually reversible once exposure ceases. Partial recovery from peripheral neuropathy can occur in some cases, especially in the more mild cases of poisoning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/47,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,50</a>].</p><p>Other symptoms that can develop after severe acute poisoning include dermatologic lesions (patchy alopecia, diffuse pruritic macular rash, herpetic-like ulcers in the mouth), respiratory symptoms (dry, hacking cough), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> Mees lines (horizontal 1- to 2-mm white lines on the nails, also called transverse leukonychia), which occur from a disturbance in the nail matrix keratinization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/2,48,51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,48,51,52</a>]. It usually takes at least 30 days for the Mees lines to become visible.</p><p>Less severely acutely poisoned patients may experience persistent gastroenteritis and mild hypotension necessitating intravenous fluids, along with a metallic taste and irritated mucous membranes that can mimic pharyngitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic and latent toxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic effects can occur as the sequelae of acute poisoning (as discussed above) or as the result of chronic longer-term exposure to lower levels of arsenic. Latent toxicity (such as cancer) can occur even after exposure has ceased.</p><p>Chronic exposure to arsenical compounds have occurred at work, usually through inhalation of arsenic-containing vapors or dusts, or through non-work environmental exposures, such as drinking arsenic-contaminated water. The clinical effects of chronic toxicity can have an insidious onset and thus be more difficult to diagnose. In chronic exposure, the skin manifestations and peripheral neurologic complaints are usually more prominent than the gastrointestinal symptoms, and concerns also focus on increased future risk of cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Skin lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different types of arsenic-related skin lesions have been described in the West Bengal and Bangladesh chronic poisonings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/20,24,25,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,24,25,53</a>]. Hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation can be an early manifestation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F57673\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57673 \">picture 1</a>). Hyperkeratoses and scaling, particularly diffusely on the palms and soles, also are quite characteristic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F78647\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78647 \">picture 2</a>). Eczematous lesions have also been described. Skin manifestations, particular maculopapular eruptions, have been described following an acute curry-poisoning incident, and included maculopapular eruptions (sometimes in intertriginous areas), nail changes (Mee's or Beau's Lines), and periungual pigmentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>Skin carcinomas and Bowen's disease (squamous cell carcinoma in situ) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F57673\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57673 \">picture 1</a>) are associated with latent effects of arsenic poisoning (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Cancer'</a> below). A cohort study from Bangladesh found a dose-response relationship between exposure to arsenic in drinking water and the risk of premalignant lesions; compared with exposure to well water with a concentration of arsenic below 8.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> the adjusted odds ratio for premalignant skin lesions was 5.4 in people exposed to water with a concentration between 175.1 and 864 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Peripheral vascular disease with associated gangrene, called &quot;Blackfoot&quot; disease, has been described in relationship to chronic arsenic poisoning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Neurologic manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A symmetrical sensorimotor polyneuropathy is one of the most prominent symptoms of arsenic poisoning and can develop one to three weeks after acute poisoning or insidiously from chronic exposures.</p><p>Sensory symptoms tend to present first and to predominate, starting with numbness and tingling particularly in the soles of the feet and then later in the hands as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/39,46,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,46,49</a>]. These may be the only symptoms in milder forms of arsenic polyneuropathy.</p><p>In more severe forms, the pain is more intense, particularly with even light touch, so that affected persons are unable to walk because of intense burning pain in the soles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Cramping in the calves is another common symptom. An early sign on physical examination is diminished vibratory sense.</p><p>Progressive symptoms may then develop in a <span class=\"nowrap\">stocking/glove</span> distribution with decreased pain, decreased sensation of touch and temperature, and symmetrical weakness, along with decreased deep tendon reflexes. Electrophysiological findings of arsenic neuropathy typically suggest a distal motor and sensory axonopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Neurologic findings may also occur with chronic exposure. A study of 43 smelter workers exposed to inorganic arsenic dust for 13 to 45 years found moderate clinical symptoms and nerve conduction velocities that were significantly lower in two peripheral nerves as compared with matching referents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

Inorganic arsenic (III or V) will be metabolized to monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), all of which are excreted predominately in the urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/4,103\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,103</a>]. Unless otherwise requested, laboratories will usually report &quot;total arsenic.&quot; In adults a spot sample can be taken and measured for arsenic, and corrected for concentration by also ordering a urine creatinine (result becomes microgram of arsenic per gram of creatinine). If there has been fish, shellfish, seaweed, or sushi intake within the last 48 to 72 hours, the nontoxic &quot;fish arsenic&quot; may lead to increased urine levels of total arsenic. A single meal of fish can increase total urine arsenic to more than 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/4,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,41</a>]. In general, it is important to request that the patient refrain from ingesting any fish, shellfish, or seaweed prior to ordering a urine specimen for arsenic. However, we have found elevated total arsenic levels (in absence of any inorganic species) even in individuals who deny any fish or sea food intake. This can happen because there are other foods, such as wild mushrooms, that contain minimally-to-nontoxic forms of arsenic, such as arsenobetaine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Because a diet history is frequently uncertain, it is best to obtain speciation of elevated urine arsenic levels in order to avoid mislabeling a person with arsenic poisoning and to obtain an accurate assessment of inorganic (toxic) arsenic levels and toxic metabolites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. For speciation, the laboratory may report individual levels of inorganic arsenic, metabolites MMA and DMA, as well as the total arsenic. At the time of ordering a total urine arsenic test, we specifically request that speciation be performed if total levels are elevated, as some laboratories do not automatically speciate the urine when levels are elevated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The measurement of arsenic in the urine is a good measure of current or very recent exposure, but not for more distant exposure, because arsenic is rapidly metabolized and excreted, with half of measurable oral dose (given to volunteers) excreted within the first 28 hours, and the rest tapered off over the next three days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hair and fingernail testing &ndash; </strong>Since inorganic arsenic (to a much greater extent than organic arsenic) is taken up and bound in hair and fingernails, hair and nails may be good indicators for recent past exposures for the amount of inorganic arsenic absorbed during the growth period (hair grows at 0.4 mm per day, while nails grow at a rate of 0.1 mm per day). However, in a setting in which arsenic is present in air or dust that comes into contact with hair, it is very difficult to remove exogenous arsenic from hair, and therefore to get a reliable reading [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/4,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,41</a>]. Also contributing to the variability of results from hair and nail testing is lack of standardization for analyses. Commercial laboratory hair analyses for multiple elements including arsenic have been found to be highly inaccurate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/105,106\" class=\"abstract_t\">105,106</a>]. Determination of arsenic in hair and nails has been most useful in epidemiological studies performed to evaluate environmental exposures of populations to inorganic arsenic. For individual patients with other signs or symptoms of arsenic poisoning thought due to past exposures, careful collection of appropriate hair samples (ideally from areas of slow growth such as pubic hair) or nails can be sent and analyzed for arsenic. Nail analysis usually requires clipping as much as possible for all 10 digits, either fingernails or toenails.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the case of an acute ingestion, abdominal radiographs may demonstrate gastrointestinal radiopaque material soon after ingestion, although the absence of opaque material does not rule out exposure. An ECG should be obtained to assess the QTc interval as well as cardiac monitoring for tachyarrhythmias. In general, measurement of arsenic levels in urine is preferable to blood, since blood arsenic is cleared rapidly. In the emergent situation, a spot urine arsenic can be obtained prior to beginning chelation therapy. The urine creatinine in the spot sample should also be obtained to correct for urine concentration. During treatment, 24-hour urine arsenic monitoring is usually performed to follow the levels of arsenic excretion over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. If the clinical presentation and history are highly suspicious for acute arsenic poisoning, treatment would need to be started urgently, prior to the return of the test results, which could take days.

The 24-hour urine determination is more accurate but less convenient. Regular surveillance for arsenic exposure in workers (for instance, after shifts) is done with measurements of spot urine arsenic and creatinine (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=collection-of-a-24-hour-urine-specimen-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Collection of a 24-hour urine specimen (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>).

Remove contaminated clothing, and wash the pesticide from the skin and hair taking care to avoid contaminating providers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Gastrointestinal decontamination is controversial since arsenic poorly adsorbs to activated charcoal, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cholestyramine-resin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cholestyramine</a>, and bentonite. Use of activate charcoal in conjunction with airway protection is performed when even a small amount of absorption might be helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].Do not administer cathartics since arsenic typically causes diarrhea. Use nasogastric suction, and administer activated charcoal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/2,108\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,108</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fluids</strong> &ndash; Administer intravenous fluids to maintain adequate urine flow.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Monitoring</strong> &ndash; Patients should have continuous cardiac monitoring. Additionally, fluid and electrolyte balance should be monitored.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chelation</strong> &ndash; Chelation therapy is usually indicated in patients with symptomatic arsenic poisoning. In a severely ill patient with known, or highly suspected, acute arsenic poisoning, chelation may need to be started before laboratory confirmation of arsenic levels is available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Activated charcoal</strong> &ndash; The role of activated charcoal, other than in patients who have had recent oral ingestion, is uncertain. In the absence of reliable data, some sources recommend its use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H201734145\"><span class=\"h3\">Chelation for acute poisoning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two chelating agents are available in the United States: <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dimercaprol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dimercaprol</a> (British Anti-Lewisite, or BAL) and meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA, succimer). A third drug, unithiol (sodium 2,3-dimercapto-1-propane sulfonate abbreviated DMPS), is marketed by a German pharmaceutical company under the trade name &quot;Dimaval&quot; and may have the most favorable profile for the treatment of acute poisoning by inorganic arsenic. It can be given intravenously, but has not been FDA approved for that use in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/2,109\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,109</a>]. In the United States, BAL remains the initial chelating drug for severe, acute arsenic toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The precise dosing for BAL for severe inorganic arsenic exposure poisoning has not been specifically established. Most of the regimens for arsenic treatment, particularly with BAL, rely on studies that are more than 20 years old, but are still recommended by respected toxicological experts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/2,110\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,110</a>]. A regimen for administering BAL is 3 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of deep intramuscular BAL administered every four to six hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/2,110\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,110</a>]. The endpoint for chelation is a 24-hour urinary arsenic concentration of &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span>.</p><p>Since BAL is administered intramuscularly, it can be used in patients with reduced consciousness or decreased gastrointestinal motility. BAL is associated with significant side effects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F69443\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69443 \">table 1</a>) and has a narrow therapeutic:toxic ratio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. BAL is formulated in peanut oil, and patients must be carefully questioned about presence of known peanut allergy. It should also be used with caution in patients with G-6-PD deficiency. Although BAL helps to speed excretion of arsenic and may help to inhibit some of the toxic effects, it is not clear that administration will prevent the development of the peripheral neuropathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5643077\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic or subacute poisoning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are few data to support the use of chelation in subacute or chronic arsenic poisoning, particularly since arsenic is so quickly excreted. The first order of treatment is identification of the source of exposure and removal from exposure. Therapy for subacute or chronic poisoning in the setting of ongoing or recent arsenic exposure may be reasonable, after all measures to stop exposure have been made and as an effort to more quickly enhance excretion of arsenic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5643085\"><span class=\"h3\">Chelation for chronic poisoning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For treating subacute or chronic severe toxicity, DMSA (an oral hydrophilic analogue of BAL) is the chelator of choice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The dosing of DMSA is based on testing in children being treated for lead poisoning. The recommended dose from the manufacturer is 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per dose three times per day for five days, followed by 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per dose twice per day for two weeks. Although we have found this dosing to be acceptable in treating some adults for lead poisoning, the dose can become quite high, especially in heavier adults. Given the lack of adult treatment data with DMSA, we have also used an adult dosing level of 500 mg twice per day for two weeks as a sensible maximum limit for treating adults with mild symptomatic lead poisoning, and similar dosing may be appropriate for treating arsenic poisoning until there are additional clinical data available for adults.</p><p>Adverse effects of chelating agents are listed in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F69443\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69443 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>DMPS is a water-soluble analogue of BAL that can be administered by oral, IV, or IM routes and may also be of benefit in treating chronic arsenic toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]; it is not approved in the United States for this use, but has been used in other countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>]. When given IM, it is administered at 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per dose as a 5 percent solution; a typical regimen would be dosing every 6 to 8 hours on the first day, every 8 to 12 hours on the second day, and every 12 to 24 hours thereafter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h1\">ADDITIONAL RESOURCES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To obtain emergent consultation with a medical toxicologist, call the United States Poison Control Network at 1-800-222-1222, or access the World Health Organization's list of international poison centers (<a href=\"http://www.who.int/gho/phe/chemical_safety/poisons_centres/en/index.html&amp;token=vYXClxsD0hnrf4M8kYcoD1kMICrGjKQRRaFc8pA0pw9qlhpVmsmYh2e3Gi7webw9H9uSzH3nipQ0rPpTLYBWhGP+/wpQqUegRzvggwgKA6s=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2778\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.who.int/gho/phe/chemical_safety/poisons_centres/en/index.html</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">General issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Efforts should be taken to reduce exposures to inorganic arsenic, a recognized carcinogen, to the extent feasible, from both naturally occurring and man-made sources. In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulates inorganic arsenic exposure in air in the workplace through a &quot;permissible exposure limit&quot; or PEL of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/m<sup>3</sup></span> as a time-weighted average over an eight-hour work day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>]. The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is more conservative and advises minimizing exposures to a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/m<sup>3</sup></span> (15 minute exposure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>].</p><p>The World Health Organization (WHO), in its 1993 guidelines for drinking water quality, reported that based on health criteria the guideline value for arsenic in drinking water should ideally be less than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L,</span> but given measurement limitations the WHO recommended a provisional guideline value of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>].</p><p>In 2002, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) lowered the maximum contaminant level for the amount of arsenic allowed in drinking water from 50 ppb to 10 ppb (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L)</span> based upon review of carcinogenic risks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>]. Although this represented an improvement, and lowering of risks, there were still estimates of excess cancer risk (at 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L)</span> among 70 kg resident drinking 1 L of water of day for a lifetime, with estimated lifetime risk, per 10,000: for bladder cancer 12 and 23 (women and men, respectively), lung cancer 18 and 24 (women and men, respectively). At lower levels of arsenic, the estimate lifetime excess risk is lower. Some advocate for lower maximum containment level (MCL).</p><p>To reduce the exposure to potential arsenic-contaminated rice products, the 2012 American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines advised giving children more foods made from wheat and oats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>] and there are additional strategies for reducing exposure of arsenic in rice. The US Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Units advised limiting consumption of foods higher in arsenic content, rinsing rice, limiting rice milk in children younger than 54 months of age, and reducing intake of foods containing high amounts of brown rice syrup [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arsenic-exposure-and-poisoning/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>].

Copper chromium arsenate (CCA), used as a wood preservative, was not included in that ban. The use of CCA in pressure-treated wood for residential uses in the United States was supposed to voluntarily cease by December 31, 2003. However, existing structures remain as potential sources of concern.

(See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Biological basis of disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute toxicity typically starts in the gastrointestinal system and includes nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. These symptoms are soon followed by dehydration, hypotension, and QTc prolongation. In severe cases, patients may experience cardiac arrhythmias, shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and sometimes death. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Acute poisoning'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In chronic poisoning, the peripheral neurologic complaints and skin manifestations are usually more prominent than the gastrointestinal symptoms. Chronic arsenic exposure is associated with increased all-cause mortality. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Chronic and latent toxicity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arsenic is rapidly cleared from the blood, so measurement of urinary arsenic either on a 24-hour urine collection or in a spot urine (along with a creatinine to correct for the concentration of the spot urine) is generally preferable. Although concentrations greater than or equal to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> or 100 mcg of arsenic per gram creatinine in the absence of recent fish, seaweed or shellfish intake strongly suggests arsenic poisoning, no conclusion can be drawn until fractionated testing confirms the presence of inorganic-related arsenic species. For more accurate assessment, both total and inorganic arsenic species should be measured in the urine. (See <a href=\"#H2336255443\" class=\"local\">'Biologic monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of acute poisoning involves decontamination of the skin and gastrointestinal tract as appropriate for the exposure, administration of fluids, cardiac monitoring, and usually chelation with BAL. DMPS is another option for treatment in countries where it is available.
