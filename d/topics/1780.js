The discussion that follows is generally consistent with these guidelines. However, it should be noted that many of the issues related to the surveillance and management of Barrett's esophagus remain controversial, with considerable disagreement among experts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management/abstract/6,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H82891986\"><span class=\"h1\">CANCER RISK</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H66916587\"><span class=\"h2\">Cancer incidence and mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Estimates of the annual cancer incidence in patients with Barrett's esophagus have ranged from 0.1 to almost 3.0 percent, with more recent studies suggesting rates closer to 0.1 to 0.4 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management/abstract/10-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-26</a>]. Although the risk of developing esophageal cancer is increased at least 30-fold above that of the general population, the absolute risk of developing cancer for a patient with nondysplastic Barrett's esophagus is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The risk of developing cancer is higher among men, older patients, and patients with long segments of Barrett's mucosa or dysplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management/abstract/18,24,25,27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,24,25,27-29</a>].</p><p>Patients with Barrett's esophagus most often die from causes unrelated to esophageal cancer. This is likely because many patients with Barrett's esophagus are older, overweight, and succumb to common diseases, such as coronary artery disease, before developing esophageal adenocarcinoma. In a meta-analysis with 50 studies that included 14,109 patients, the mortality rate due to esophageal adenocarcinoma was 3.0 per 1000 person-years, whereas the mortality rate due to other causes was 37.1 per 1000 person-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H66915892\"><span class=\"h2\">Dysplasia as a marker of risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Esophageal adenocarcinoma in patients with Barrett's esophagus is thought to evolve through a sequence of genetic alterations that are associated with dysplastic changes of progressive severity. However, few studies document the natural history of dysplasia, so the rate at which metaplasia progresses to dysplasia and cancer is unclear. The estimates of the risk of progression of dysplastic Barrett's esophagus to esophageal adenocarcinoma range from 0.2 to 14 percent per year and vary based on the baseline degree of dysplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management/abstract/16,27,30-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,27,30-41</a>]. The reasons underlying the disparities in the reported rates of progression are unsettled, but may in part be due to referral bias and inclusion of patients with prevalent cancers in some of the reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management/abstract/33,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,42</a>].</p><p>A meta-analysis that included 24 studies with 2694 patients who had low-grade dysplasia found that esophageal adenocarcinoma developed in 119 patients (4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

The reasons underlying these disparities are not entirely clear, but a major factor appears to be differences in how study pathologists diagnose low-grade dysplasia. &ldquo;Expert&rdquo; pathologists will usually downgrade a diagnosis of low-grade dysplasia made by community pathologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. A meta-analysis estimates that patients with low-grade dysplasia progress to cancer at the rate of 0.54 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], but the range of reported cancer risk is so high that precise estimates of cancer risk are not possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management/abstract/31,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,40</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indefinite for dysplasia: As with low-grade dysplasia, the risk of cancer is poorly defined.

Some groups suggest screening patients with several risk factors for developing esophageal adenocarcinoma (eg, gastroesophageal reflux disease, age &gt;50 years, male sex, elevated body mass index with an abdominal pattern of fat distribution). Screening for Barrett's esophagus is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barretts-esophagus-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Barrett's esophagus: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Screening patients for Barrett's esophagus'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H62054344\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H62054350\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of acid reflux</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We treat virtually all patients with Barrett's esophagus indefinitely with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) based on data from observational and in vitro studies that suggest aggressive antireflux therapy might prevent cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management/abstract/43-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-46</a>]. In addition, many patients with Barrett's esophagus also have symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or endoscopic evidence of reflux esophagitis, both of which justify treatment with PPIs. We typically start patients on a standard dose of a PPI once daily (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a> 20 mg daily), and only increase the dose if it is required to eliminate GERD symptoms or to heal reflux esophagitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults#H102009998\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical management of gastroesophageal reflux disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Proton pump inhibitors'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-refractory-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults#H1992771471\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Subsequent management'</a>.)</p><p>The primary rationale behind treating acid reflux is that it may lead to chronic esophageal inflammation, which in turn may predispose to cancer development. Acid also can cause potentially carcinogenic DNA damage in Barrett's epithelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In a meta-analysis of seven studies that included 2813 patients with Barrett's esophagus and 317 patients with high-grade dysplasia or esophageal adenocarcinoma, the use of PPIs was associated with a decreased risk of high-grade dysplasia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> esophageal adenocarcinoma (adjusted odds ratio 0.29; 95% CI 0.12-0.79) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>It has been suggested that patients with Barrett's esophagus are unusually resistant to PPI treatment. Esophageal pH monitoring studies frequently reveal pathologic levels of acid reflux in patients with Barrett's esophagus rendered asymptomatic by PPIs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. However, such resistance may be a consequence of a profound reflux diathesis rather than gastric resistance to the antisecretory effects of PPIs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In other words, PPIs appear to reduce gastric acid secretion appropriately in patients with Barrett's esophagus, but the little acid that remains in the stomach refluxes into the esophagus because of the strong reflux diathesis, so pathologic levels of acid reflux persist despite considerable acid suppression. Antireflux surgery (fundoplication) is an option for highly selected patients who appear to be resistant to PPI treatment (manifest by abnormal acid reflux despite PPI therapy or nonhealing reflux esophagitis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>], although whether fundoplication is more effective at preventing esophageal adenocarcinoma than medical therapy is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management/abstract/51-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-55</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of gastroesophageal reflux in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Aggressive antireflux therapy may result in partial regression of the specialized intestinal metaplasia in Barrett's esophagus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. In a randomized trial, 68 patients with proven Barrett's esophagus and acid reflux were assigned to receive profound acid suppression (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a> 40 mg twice daily) or mild acid suppression (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranitidine</a> 150 mg twice daily) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Symptoms of acid reflux improved in both groups, but the degree of acid suppression was greater with omeprazole. There was a small amount of regression of Barrett's esophagus in patients who received omeprazole, but none in patients who received ranitidine. However, it is not clear that partial regression of Barrett's metaplasia means that the risk of cancer has decreased.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H62054644\"><span class=\"h2\">Chemoprevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epidemiological data suggest that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) may protect against the development of Barrett's esophagus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>], or in patients with established Barrett's esophagus, the development of cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. The specialized intestinal metaplasia of Barrett's esophagus exhibits increased expression of COX-2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>], and inhibition of COX-2 has been shown to have antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in Barrett's-associated esophageal adenocarcinoma cell lines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. However, given the potential for adverse effects and the overall low absolute risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma, we do not routinely recommend NSAIDs for patients with Barrett's esophagus solely for the purpose of chemoprevention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H66916587\" class=\"local\">'Cancer incidence and mortality'</a> above.)</p><p>Studies that have examined the efficacy of chemoprevention in patients with Barrett's esophagus have found that the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> or NSAIDs is associated with a decrease in the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma by approximately 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management/abstract/45,58,60,63-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,58,60,63-65</a>]. The protective effect may be greater if the NSAID is combined with a statin. In a prospective study of 570 patients with Barrett's esophagus, 107 used a statin combined with an NSAID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. After a mean follow-up of 4.5 years, compared with patients using neither drug, the risk of developing adenocarcinoma or high-grade dysplasia was significantly reduced among patients using NSAIDs and statins (adjusted hazard ratio 0.22; 95% CI 0.06-0.85). The adjusted hazard ratio among the 211 patients using only an NSAID was 0.46 (95% CI 0.22-0.99). Unlike studies showing a benefit with nonselective NSAIDS, a trial of a selective COX-2 inhibitor found no benefit in preventing the progression of Barrett's esophagus to dysplasia or cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>A large trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> for the prevention of cancer in Barrett's esophagus (the ASPECT trial) is being conducted in the United Kingdom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H168914014\"><span class=\"h1\">SURVEILLANCE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H168917451\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of surveillance is to improve outcomes by detecting dysplasia or esophageal adenocarcinoma early enough to provide effective treatment. Current guidelines suggest surveillance for most patients with Barrett's esophagus, but whether surveillance is beneficial is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management/abstract/3-6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6,8</a>]. Available observational studies have not consistently shown that surveillance is beneficial. In addition, there are potential harms associated with surveillance, including a decrease in quality of life due to worry about cancer development, the risks associated with endoscopy, the risks and morbidity associated with invasive therapies used to treat lesions identified by surveillance (such as esophagectomy or radiofrequency ablation), and missed lesions despite surveillance. As a result, a well-informed patient with nondysplastic Barrett's esophagus may reasonably choose not to undergo surveillance despite endorsement of the practice by gastrointestinal societies. The discussion of the risks and benefits of surveillance should be well documented in the patient's medical record, particularly if the patient elects not to undergo surveillance. If surveillance is performed, it is important to treat erosive esophagitis prior to obtaining biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management/abstract/3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7</a>].</p><p>Our approach is to perform an initial endoscopy with four-quadrant biopsies every 2 cm in patients with suspected Barrett's esophagus (eg, salmon-colored esophageal mucosa) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F62689\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62689 \">picture 1</a>). If four-quadrant biopsies every 2 cm were not obtained at the initial endoscopy, we repeat the endoscopy within a year to obtain the biopsies. In addition, any mucosal irregularities in the Barrett's segment should be removed with endoscopic resection, and the resected specimen should be sent for evaluation by an experienced pathologist. </p><p>Our subsequent recommendations depend on whether dysplasia is present in these specimens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F103792\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef103792 \">algorithm 1</a>). Any diagnosis of dysplasia should be confirmed by a second pathologist with expertise in Barrett&rsquo;s esophagus-related neoplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management/abstract/3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>No dysplasia:</strong> If the initial biopsies show no dysplasia, we discuss the potential risks and benefits of regular endoscopic surveillance with the patient. In general, we suggest ongoing surveillance every three to five years. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Indefinite for dysplasia:</strong> If the initial biopsies are indefinite for dysplasia, we recommend optimizing medical antireflux therapy (eg, prescribing a proton pump inhibitor [PPI] twice daily, ensuring compliance with PPI therapy, ensuring that the PPI is taken correctly). Antireflux therapy minimizes reactive esophageal changes due to reflux esophagitis that may be mistaken for dysplastic changes. After antireflux therapy has been optimized, we repeat an endoscopy with biopsy specimens taken every 1 cm. We typically perform the endoscopy after two months of treatment (to allow sufficient time for healing), though the guideline from the American College of Gastroenterology suggests waiting for at least three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Repeat endoscopy should not be delayed beyond six months. Any mucosal irregularities should be removed with endoscopic resection. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If the repeat biopsies still are indefinite for dysplasia, the diagnosis should be confirmed by a pathologist with expertise in esophageal histopathology. If the diagnosis is confirmed, management options include surveillance endoscopy every 12 months or referral of the patient to a center with expertise in managing patients with Barrett's esophagus. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia, or intramucosal carcinoma:</strong> If the biopsies show dysplasia or intramucosal carcinoma, we suggest that the diagnosis be confirmed by another pathologist with expertise in Barrett&rsquo;s esophagus-related neoplasia. All patients initially found to have low-grade dysplasia should undergo repeat upper endoscopy using high <span class=\"nowrap\">definition/high-resolution</span> white light endoscopy under intense acid suppression (eg, after 8 to 12 weeks of twice daily proton pump inhibitor therapy). Four quadrant biopsy specimens should be obtained at 1 cm intervals and any mucosal irregularities should be removed with endoscopic resection to accurately assess the grade of dysplasia. This repeat endoscopy is to ensure that the metaplastic mucosa is adequately inspected and biopsied appropriately before proceeding to endoscopic eradication.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We generally recommend endoscopic eradication therapy for patients who are confirmed to have high-grade dysplasia or intramucosal carcinoma, and who have no evidence of submucosal invasion in their resected specimens.

In patients who elect to undergo endoscopic eradication, endoscopic radiofrequency ablation is preferable for preventing progression of dysplasia. If endoscopic surveillance is the chosen approach for low-grade dysplasia, patients should have biopsies obtained every 1 cm, any mucosal irregularities should be removed with endoscopic resection, and surveillance should be performed every 6 months for one year and then annually until there is reversion to non-dysplastic Barrett&rsquo;s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Thus, ER can be therapeutic and can provide invaluable information regarding the depth of tumor involvement (T stage). The frequency of metachronous neoplasia appears to be reduced if all Barrett's metaplasia is eradicated, not just the dysplastic areas, and the goal of modern endoscopic therapy for dysplasia is to eradicate both dysplastic and nondysplastic Barrett's metaplasia completely.

Alternative methods to achieve eradication include photodynamic therapy (PDT), spray cryotherapy, and endoscopic resection of the entire segment of Barrett's mucosa, but RFA is the preferred ablation technique at this time.

Generally, esophagectomy is no longer used as first-line treatment for dysplasia, although esophagectomy is still used in special circumstances, such as in patients unwilling to accept the uncertainties regarding the long-term results of endoscopic eradication therapy. The frequency of surveillance will depend on whether all intestinal metaplasia is eradicated.

Their role in the management of Barrett's esophagus with high-grade dysplasia continues to be defined, although they may be an option in centers with appropriate expertise.</p><p>One advantage of esophagectomy over endoscopic eradication is that occult lymph node metastases can be detected. However, lymph node metastases occur in only one to two percent of patients with high-grade dysplasia or intramucosal carcinoma in Barrett's esophagus, and this rate of metastatic disease is lower than the mortality rate associated with esophagectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>]. In addition, esophagectomy does not guarantee cure for a tumor that already has metastasized to the lymph nodes. A systematic review looked at the frequency of lymph node metastases in patients with mucosal neoplasms in Barrett's esophagus who underwent esophagectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>]. The review included 70 studies with 1874 patients who underwent esophagectomy with lymph node dissection for high-grade dysplasia or intramucosal carcinoma. Overall, lymph node metastases were identified in the resection specimen from 26 of the patients (1.4 percent). When evaluated based on the final pathologic diagnosis, there were no metastases in the 524 patients with high-grade dysplasia, and metastases were found in 26 of the 1350 patients (1.9 percent) with intramucosal carcinoma. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Intensive endoscopic surveillance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some authorities had recommended a program of expectant management with intensive endoscopic surveillance (ie, endoscopic examinations every three to six months) for patients with high-grade dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus, withholding invasive treatments like endoscopic eradication or esophagectomy until biopsy specimens revealed adenocarcinoma. However, few published studies directly support the safety and efficacy of intensive surveillance for high-grade dysplasia. With the safety and efficacy of endoscopic eradication therapy demonstrated in randomized trials, medical societies now recommend eradication therapy rather than intensive surveillance for patients with high-grade dysplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management/abstract/3-6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6,8</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One report described 75 patients with high-grade dysplasia who underwent intensive endoscopic surveillance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. During a mean follow-up of 7.3 years, 12 patients (16 percent) developed adenocarcinomas. The cancers were curable at the time of detection in all 11 patients who were compliant with the surveillance program, but one patient who was lost to follow-up returned years later with an unresectable tumor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another series of 32 patients with high-grade dysplasia who developed adenocarcinoma during intensive endoscopic surveillance, only one patient had incurable disease (metastases) when the cancer was first detected on surveillance endoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a third study, the investigators performed intensive endoscopic surveillance in 15 patients with high-grade dysplasia for a mean duration of 37 months, during which four developed adenocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management/abstract/124\" class=\"abstract_t\">124</a>].

However, it should be noted that many of the issues related to the surveillance and management of Barrett's esophagus remain controversial, with considerable disagreement among experts. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma in patients with nondysplastic Barrett's esophagus is estimated to be 0.1 to 0.4 percent per year. Although this risk is increased at least 30-fold above that of the general population, the absolute risk for any individual patient with nondysplastic Barrett's esophagus is low. (See <a href=\"#H82891986\" class=\"local\">'Cancer risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that all patients with Barrett's esophagus receive treatment with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) rather than reserving treatment only for patients who are symptomatic (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We typically start patients on a standard dose of a PPI once daily (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a> 20 mg daily), and only increase the dose if it is required to eliminate gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms or to heal reflux esophagitis. (See <a href=\"#H62054350\" class=\"local\">'Management of acid reflux'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with suspected Barrett's esophagus, we perform endoscopic four-quadrant biopsies every 2 cm. Any mucosal irregularities in the Barrett's segment should be removed with endoscopic resection, and the resected specimen should be sent for evaluation by a pathologist with expertise in esophageal histopathology. Subsequent recommendations depend on whether dysplasia is seen on histology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F103792\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef103792 \">algorithm 1</a>). Any diagnosis of dysplasia should be confirmed by a second pathologist with expertise in esophageal pathology. (See <a href=\"#H168917451\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above and <a href=\"#H168914589\" class=\"local\">'Surveillance techniques'</a> above.):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Nondysplastic Barrett's esophagus</strong>: If the biopsies show no dysplasia, we discuss with the patient the potential risks and benefits of surveillance. Some of the potential harms include a decrease in quality of life due to worry about cancer development, the risks associated with endoscopy, the risks and morbidity associated with invasive therapies used to treat lesions identified by surveillance, and missed lesions despite surveillance. A well-informed patient with nondysplastic Barrett's esophagus may reasonably choose not to undergo surveillance despite endorsement of the practice by gastrointestinal societies. A discussion of the risks and benefits of surveillance should be well documented in the patient's medical record, particularly if the patient elects to not undergo surveillance. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">For patients with nondysplastic Barrett's esophagus, we generally suggest surveillance every three to five years (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Low-grade dysplasia</strong>: A finding of low-grade dysplasia on biopsies should be confirmed by a pathologist with expertise in Barrett&rsquo;s esophagus-related neoplasia. We feel that all patients initially found to have low-grade dysplasia should undergo repeat upper endoscopy using high <span class=\"nowrap\">definition/high-resolution</span> white light endoscopy under intense acid suppression (eg, 8 to 12 weeks of twice daily proton pump inhibitor therapy). In addition, four quadrant biopsy specimens should be obtained at 1 cm intervals, and any mucosal irregularities should be removed with endoscopic resection. This repeat endoscopy is recommended to ensure that the metaplastic mucosa is adequately inspected and biopsied appropriately before proceeding to endoscopic eradication.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">If low-grade dysplasia is confirmed, we suggest referring the patient for endoscopic eradication therapy rather than expectant management with ongoing surveillance (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). While current guidelines recommend either surveillance or endoscopic eradication for patients with low-grade dysplasia, studies suggest that endoscopic ablation is preferable. (See <a href=\"#H66920620\" class=\"local\">'Low-grade dysplasia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Our preference for endoscopic eradication therapy is endoscopic resection of any visible mucosal irregularities, followed by RFA to ablate the remaining metaplastic epithelium (provided the resected specimen shows no submucosal invasion). This approach is effective and has a good safety profile. The frequency of subsequent surveillance will depend on whether all intestinal metaplasia is eradicated. (See <a href=\"#H66920620\" class=\"local\">'Low-grade dysplasia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopic ablative therapies'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopic resection'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation#H155437279\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Barrett's esophagus: Treatment with radiofrequency ablation&quot;, section on 'Follow-up endoscopy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">If the patient does not undergo endoscopic eradication for low-grade dysplasia, surveillance endoscopy should be performed every six months for one year with biopsies every 1 cm and then annually until there is reversion to non-dysplastic Barrett&rsquo;s. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Indefinite for dysplasia: </strong>If the initial biopsies are indefinite for dysplasia, we recommend optimizing medical antireflux therapy (eg, prescribing a PPI twice daily, ensuring compliance with PPI therapy, ensuring that the PPI is taken correctly). Antireflux therapy minimizes reactive esophageal changes due to reflux esophagitis that may be mistaken for dysplastic changes. After antireflux therapy has been optimized, we repeat an endoscopy with biopsy specimens taken every 1 cm. We typically perform the endoscopy after two months of treatment (to allow sufficient time for healing). Repeat endoscopy should not be delayed beyond six months. Any mucosal irregularities should be removed with endoscopic resection. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">If the repeat biopsies still are indefinite for dysplasia, the diagnosis should be confirmed by a pathologist with expertise in esophageal histopathology. If the diagnosis is confirmed, management options include surveillance endoscopy every 12 months or referral of the patient to a center with expertise in managing patients with Barrett's esophagus. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>High-grade dysplasia or intramucosal carcinoma</strong>: For patients found to have high-grade dysplasia or intramucosal carcinoma, biopsy specimens should be obtained at 1 cm intervals, and any mucosal irregularities should be removed with endoscopic resection. If biopsy specimens were not obtained at 1 cm intervals or a mucosal irregularity was not removed with endoscopic resection, endoscopy should be repeated as soon as possible to obtain these specimens. A finding of high-grade dysplasia or intramucosal carcinoma on biopsies should be confirmed by a pathologist with expertise in esophageal histopathology. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">If high-grade dysplasia or intramucosal carcinoma is confirmed, and there is no evidence of submucosal invasion in the resected specimens, we suggest endoscopic eradication therapy rather than esophagectomy or intensive endoscopic surveillance (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). The frequency of subsequent surveillance will depend on whether all intestinal metaplasia is eradicated. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopic ablative therapies'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation#H155437279\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Barrett's esophagus: Treatment with radiofrequency ablation&quot;, section on 'Follow-up endoscopy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Our approach to endoscopic eradication therapy is to perform endoscopic resection of any visible mucosal irregularities, followed by RFA to ablate the remaining metaplastic epithelium.
