The diagnosis is usually suspected from cardiac auscultation and then confirmed by echocardiography. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and diagnosis of mitral valve prolapse&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although the correlation between certain nonspecific symptoms and MVP remains unclear, many patients with this disorder present with palpitations and atrial or ventricular arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. Some studies suggest that these patients are at increased risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) compared with the general population, but the exact incidence is unknown. Furthermore, since atrial and ventricular arrhythmias are common in the general population, it is not clearly established that the incidence of arrhythmias and SCD are in fact increased in patients with MVP. </p><p>This topic will review the incidence of arrhythmias, the risk of SCD, the electrocardiographic abnormalities that can be seen, and the treatment of arrhythmias in patients with MVP. The nonarrhythmic complications of MVP, including nonspecific symptoms and major complications, such as infective endocarditis, MR, transient ischemic attacks, and cerebrovascular accidents, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonarrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonarrhythmic complications of mitral valve prolapse&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitral-valve-prolapse-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mitral valve prolapse syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE OF ARRHYTHMIAS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies report a broad range in incidence of the arrhythmias in patients with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrial premature beats &ndash; 35 to 90 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia &ndash; 3 to 32 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ventricular premature beats &ndash; 58 to 89 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complex ventricular ectopy &ndash; 30 to 56 percent</p><p/><p>This wide variability is most likely due to selection bias and to the heterogeneity of the populations studied. Most studies have been performed in adults, but ventricular arrhythmias have also been reported in children with MVP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. </p><p>What remains unclear is whether the incidence of one or more of these arrhythmias in adults with MVP is higher than in controls. Some well-controlled studies do not show an increased incidence of arrhythmias in MVP. The Framingham Heart Study compared 84 patients with MVP, based upon current two-dimensional echocardiographic criteria, with 3403 control subjects without MVP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. On average, the patients in this study had trace to mild mitral regurgitation (MR). The prevalence of atrial ectopy (3.2 versus 1.6 percent), atrial fibrillation (1.2 versus 1.7 percent), and ventricular ectopy (2.6 versus 1.4) was equivalent in the two groups. This study suggests that MVP without significant MR is not associated with excess risk of atrial or ventricular arrhythmias.</p><p>Arrhythmias may be more common in patients with MVP who develop MR, a population that may be overrepresented in some studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Patients with MR and MVP have more ventricular arrhythmias than those with MVP alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The presence of moderate to severe MR is an independent predictor of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with MVP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Atrial arrhythmias are also more common in those with MVP and MR than in those with MVP alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The presence of moderate to severe MR is an independent predictor of atrial arrhythmias in patients with MVP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>In echocardiographic series of patients with MVP, the observed frequency of atrial fibrillation (AF) has varied from 1 to 25 percent or more [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In a study of 246 patients with MVP with MR undergoing mitral valve surgery, the frequency of chronic AF was 15 percent, and paroxysmal AF occurred in 13 percent. Risk factors for development of AF were evaluated in 89 patients with moderate to severe MR and simple MVP and 360 patients with flail mitral leaflets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In both groups, the predictors of AF were age and left atrial diameter. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sudden cardiac death (SCD) in patients with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is usually due to ventricular fibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, the relation between MVP and SCD is uncertain. Consistent with a causative role for MVP is the observation that MVP is the only cardiac abnormality in some patients at autopsy and in certain survivors of SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/15-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-22</a>]. As an example, among a cohort of 24 patients with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator who experienced idiopathic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (all had no evidence of myocardial ischemia, cardiomyopathy, or channelopathy), 10 patients (42 percent) were found to have bileaflet MVP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Patients with MVP in this cohort were also significantly more likely to have T wave abnormalities and ventricular ectopy compared with those with normal mitral valves. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Electrocardiographic abnormalities'</a> below.)</p><p>MVP is also the only cardiac abnormality found in 8 to 16 percent of patients with refractory ventricular tachycardia (VT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. On the other hand, both SCD and VT can occur in patients without apparent structural heart disease, and it is not clear that other causes of SCD and VT were excluded in the above reports. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sudden cardiac arrest in the absence of apparent structural heart disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in the absence of apparent structural heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The incidence of SCD in patients with MVP is not clearly established. One estimate of the risk of SCD in patients with MVP without MR was 1.9 per 10,000 patients per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The risk was estimated to be 50 to 100 times higher (0.9 to 1.9 percent per year) if significant MR is present; this is the rate that was later observed in patients with flail mitral leaflet (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Flail mitral leaflet'</a> below). In series including patients with MVP with a spectrum of MR severity, an intermediate risk of SCD has been observed. Two such series of 237 and 300 patients, both with mean follow-up of six years, found that SCD occurred in 2.5 and 1.0 percent (0.4 and 0.2 percent per year), respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>Early small series of patients with MVP suggested an association between the following factors and increased risk of SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/1-3,17,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,17,23</a>]: history of syncope or near syncope, symptoms such as palpitations, chest pain, and dyspnea, prolonged QT interval or inferolateral repolarization abnormalities, frequent or complex ventricular premature beats, prolapse of both the anterior and posterior mitral valve leaflets, hemodynamically significant mitral regurgitation, and flail mitral leaflet. The increased risk of SCD associated with flail mitral leaflet was confirmed in a large series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Flail mitral leaflet'</a> below.)</p><p>A study of 237 patients found a higher incidence of SCD (approximately 1.6 percent per year) in patients with redundant (defined as thickness of 5 mm or more) mitral valve leaflets as compared with the rate (approximately 0.1 percent per year) for those without redundant leaflets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The increased risk of SCD associated with MR may be directly related to the valvular regurgitation, rather than MVP itself. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonarrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonarrhythmic complications of mitral valve prolapse&quot;, section on 'Mitral regurgitation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk stratification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As for other patient populations, prior cardiac arrest or sustained VT are strong predictors of SCD in individuals with MVP. While other clinical risk factors for sudden death, such as the presence of flail leaflet or the presence of significant mitral regurgitation, have been proposed, no specific recommendations for risk stratification of patients with MVP have been defined.</p><p>The 2006 American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/European</span> Society of Cardiology guidelines for ventricular arrhythmias and SCD recommended that patients with valvular heart disease and ventricular arrhythmias should be evaluated and treated following current recommendations for each disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. No specific risk stratification of patients with MVP for SCD was recommended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Flail mitral leaflet</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among patients with MVP, SCD appears be more common in patients with chordal rupture resulting in a flail mitral leaflet, particularly those treated conservatively.

Other comorbidities prevalent in these patients may have been important.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical correction of the flail leaflet reduced the incidence of sudden death (adjusted hazard ratio 0.29).</p><p/><p>Causes of sudden cardiac arrest generally are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and etiology of sudden cardiac arrest&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHIC ABNORMALITIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several electrocardiographic abnormalities have been reported in patients with mitral valve prolapse (MVP), including QT interval prolongation, repolarization abnormalities, and evidence for accessory pathways. These findings, however, are not supported by all surveys of patients with MVP. As an example, some studies report that as many as 75 percent of patients with MVP have QT interval prolongation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In contrast, at least two series found no increase in QT prolongation compared with control populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/1,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,26</a>]. The Framingham Heart Study found no difference in the prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy or left atrial enlargement between those with and without MVP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>There is also no evidence to indicate an increased prevalence of accessory pathways in patients with MVP. In addition, the claim that ST segment and T wave abnormalities are more common in MVP is controversial, as is the possible link between repolarization abnormalities and arrhythmias. One study noted greater dispersion of refractoriness in 32 patients with MVP and documented ventricular arrhythmias, although the QT interval was not prolonged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. This raises the possibility that regional shortening and lengthening of repolarization times may be a mechanism for arrhythmias and SCD in MVP.</p><p>The role of the signal-averaged electrocardiogram for the evaluation of ventricular arrhythmias is also unclear. Although late potentials have been identified in patients with MVP, the sensitivity of late potentials as a predictor of ventricular tachycardia appears to be low (eg, sensitivity of 52 percent and specificity of 90 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/4,7,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7,28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21325375\"><span class=\"h1\">CMR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging report, focal late gadolinium enhancement in the papillary muscles was observed in patients with mitral valve prolapse, particularly in those with complex ventricular arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The clinical significance of this observation has not been determined.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">ELECTROPHYSIOLOGIC TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electrophysiologic (EP) testing has been used in an attempt to understand the role of arrhythmias in patients with mitral valve prolapse. Unfortunately, the data are again conflicting. It has been suggested that patients with symptoms or documented arrhythmias are more likely to have inducible ventricular tachycardia. However, an analysis of six fairly rigorous studies found that only 6 out of 100 patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia had inducible sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia; as a result, the association between inducibility and clinical symptoms is unlikely to be valid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Similar to its role in other patient groups, EP testing is not generally performed in survivors of sudden cardiac death or sustained ventricular tachycardia.

Treatment is then initiated based upon both the arrhythmia and the severity of symptoms. The benefit derived from the relief of symptoms with treatment must be weighed against the possible proarrhythmic and other side effects of many antiarrhythmic drugs.

Beta blockers can occasionally be used; they are particularly effective in patients with inappropriate heart rate responses to stress, anxiety, or activity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ventricular-premature-beats#H15572596\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ventricular premature beats&quot;, section on 'Beta blockers and calcium channel blockers'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Atrial fibrillation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As mentioned above, it is not clear if the incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF) is increased in patients with MVP who have no or mild mitral regurgitation (MR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].
