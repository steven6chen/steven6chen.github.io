The pathophysiology of HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of HFpEF are discussed separately.

While somewhat arbitrary, patients in these two groups share many key differences on average (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F87847\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87847 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]:</p><p>HF with preserved EF (HFpEF) is characterized by a normal LVEF, normal LV end-diastolic volume, and abnormal diastolic function, often with LV concentric remodeling or hypertrophy, but sometimes with normal ventricular geometry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/2,4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4-8</a>]. Most authorities currently define HFpEF by LVEF &ge;50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The dominant abnormality resides in diastole, but there are also abnormalities in systolic function, the left atrium, pulmonary vasculature, right ventricle, arteries, and skeletal muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, in clinical practice, the diagnosis of HFpEF is often one of exclusion based on the finding of a normal or near normal (or &quot;preserved&quot;) LVEF. As discussed below, HFpEF may be best defined as HF with LVEF &ge;50 percent and evidence of diastolic dysfunction.</p><p>HF with reduced EF (HFrEF) is characterized by more profound abnormalities in systolic function than what are seen in HFpEF, usually with progressive chamber dilation and eccentric remodeling. HFrEF is now most commonly defined by LVEF &le;40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. </p><p>Studies have shown that there is a third group of patients with mid-range LVEF (HFmrEF; 41 to 49 percent) that seem to share features of both HFrEF and HFpEF. While there are very few prospective trial data in this cohort, some data suggest that these patients have characteristics similar to those with HFrEF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Some experts treat these patients like HFrEF, while others treat these patients as borderline HFpEF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>HFrEF and HFpEF are distinct syndromes, not a continuous spectrum of disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Distinctions between HFpEF and HFrEF include epidemiologic differences, LV morphologic differences, as well as differences in the cardiomyocytes and extracellular matrix [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/14-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-19</a>]. Conversion from HFpEF to HFrEF is uncommon and generally associated with an incident injury (such as myocardial infarction) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Diastolic dysfunction versus HFpEF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diastolic dysfunction and HFpEF are not synonymous terms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Diastolic dysfunction indicates a functional abnormality of diastolic relaxation, filling, or distensibility of the LV, regardless of whether the LVEF is normal or abnormal and whether the patient is symptomatic or not. Thus, diastolic dysfunction refers to abnormal mechanical properties of the ventricle. HFpEF denotes the signs and symptoms of clinical HF in a patient with a normal LVEF and LV diastolic dysfunction. Diastolic dysfunction alone is essentially part of normal human aging and is seen in many people that do not or never will have HFpEF. However, the presence of diastolic dysfunction is clearly a risk factor for developing HFpEF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is ongoing discussion about the most appropriate nomenclature and precise diagnostic criteria to apply to HF patients. The approach to the diagnosis of HFpEF is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGY OF LEFT VENTRICULAR DIASTOLE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An appreciation of normal diastolic function permits a better understanding of the clinical features of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Cardiac function is critically dependent upon diastolic physiologic mechanisms to provide adequate left ventricular (LV) filling (cardiac input) in parallel with LV ejection (cardiac output). These processes must function under a variety of physiologic conditions, both at rest and during exercise.</p><p>LV diastolic pressure is determined by the volume of blood in the ventricle, the distensibility or compliance of the ventricle, and the degree of external pressure applied on the LV by the pericardium and right heart chambers. During diastole, the LV, left atrium (LA), and pulmonary veins form a &quot;common chamber,&quot; which is continuous with the pulmonary capillary bed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F74512\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74512 \">figure 2</a>). Thus, an increase in LV diastolic pressure will increase pulmonary venous (and capillary) pressure, which can cause dyspnea, exercise limitation, and pulmonary congestion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Events during diastole</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diastole begins with the relaxation of the contracted myocardium. This is a dynamic, energy-dependent process that includes two phases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61186\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61186 \">figure 3</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isovolumic relaxation &ndash; Isovolumic relaxation is the period between aortic valve closure and mitral valve opening during which LV pressure declines with no change in volume.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Auxotonic relaxation &ndash; During the period of auxotonic relaxation, the LV fills at variable pressure beginning with mitral valve opening and ending by mid diastole in normal individuals and most patients. </p><p/><p>During diastole in the normal heart, there is rapid pressure decay associated with &quot;untwisting&quot; and elastic recoil of the LV, producing a suction effect that promotes ventricular filling by increasing the LA-LV pressure gradient and pulling blood into the ventricle. This process is augmented during exercise to compensate for the reduced diastolic filling period induced by the associated increase in heart rate. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Normal response to exercise'</a> below.)</p><p>During the later phases of diastole, cardiomyocytes are relaxed and the normal LV is compliant and readily distensible, with minimal resistance to additional LV filling over a normal volume range. Atrial contraction contributes 20 to 30 percent to total LV filling volume, but usually increases diastolic pressures by less than 5 mmHg.</p><p>Normal diastolic properties allow LV filling to be accomplished by very low filling pressures in the LA and pulmonary veins, thereby preserving a low pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure (&lt;12 to 15 mmHg) and a high degree of lung distensibility. Loss of normal LV diastolic relaxation and distensibility impairs LV filling, resulting in increases in LV, LA, and pulmonary venous pressures during diastole, which directly increase the pulmonary capillary pressure. Acutely and chronically, these changes may affect gas exchange and contribute to symptoms of dyspnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal response to exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiac output can increase several-fold during exercise, an appropriate response to the enhanced needs of exercising muscle for oxygen delivery. Multiple factors contribute to this response, including an increase in heart rate, a modest rise in stroke volume, a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance, and an elevation in LV contractile function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/11,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,28</a>].</p><p>The increase in cardiac output must be matched by an increase in LV input. However, increased input cannot be accomplished by the same mechanisms that increase output. As an example, the rise in heart rate that contributes to increased output also shortens the duration of diastole. To offset this and maintain or increase stroke volume, the diastolic filling rate during exercise must increase to support the increase in cardiac output.</p><p>Increased LV filling requires a rise in the rate of diastolic flow across the mitral valve, which in turn requires an increase in the transmitral diastolic pressure gradient. The normal LV permits a remarkable increase in diastolic filling rate during exercise by rapidly and markedly decreasing LV pressure during early diastole, thereby augmenting the LV &quot;suction&quot; effect and enhancing the transmitral pressure gradient without increasing LA pressure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F51956\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51956 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-32</a>].</p><p>Some of the mechanisms that effect increases in cardiac output and cardiac input during exercise act in concert on systolic and diastolic function:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several mechanisms contribute to the enhanced LV diastolic &quot;suction&quot; effect during exercise. Increased contractile function during exercise enhances early diastolic elastic recoil. Thus, greater systolic shortening produces a smaller end-systolic volume, which increases elastic recoil and results in enhanced early diastolic filling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Studies have shown that the ability to enhance diastolic forces that determine suction and relaxation is strongly correlated with the ability to enhance contractile function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Treppe effect describes a relationship between the heart rate (or frequency of contraction), LV pressure (or systolic force development), and ejection fraction (or shortening) such that in a normal heart, an increase in heart rate is associated with an increase in contractility over a physiologic range of heart rates. This has been called the systolic &quot;force-frequency relationship.&quot; The same mechanism governs the relationship between heart rate and diastolic relaxation rate where increased heart rate in a normal heart is associated with an increased relaxation rate, which contributes to the maintenance of normal LV diastolic pressures and pulmonary venous pressure during exercise.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During exercise in a normal individual, the LV utilizes the Frank-Starling mechanism to augment stroke volume. It is the normal distensibility of the LV that allows an increase in end-diastolic volume with minimal change in late diastolic pressure and no significant change in pulmonary venous pressure.</p><p/><p>In summary, the normal heart during exercise has an elegant balance of physiologic mechanisms to ensure that cardiac input keeps pace with cardiac output, with preservation of a low pulmonary capillary pressure. These mechanisms result in an increase in measured LV distensibility, as manifested by a downward shift of the LV diastolic pressure-volume curve, especially during early diastole (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79248\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79248 \">figure 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].

By contrast, in HFrEF, the cardiomyocytes are elongated with little or no change in diameter, corresponding to the increase in LV volume with no change in LV wall thickness.</p><p>In HFpEF, there is sometimes an increase in the amount of collagen with a corresponding increment in the width and continuity of the fibrillar components of the extracellular matrix [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/2,39,40,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,39,40,44</a>].

When myocardial relaxation is impaired, the rate and amount of early diastolic LV filling are reduced. This reduction requires a relative shift of LV filling to the later part of diastole, with atrial contraction making a more important contribution to ventricular filling than in normal subjects. The redistribution of filling from early to late diastole makes patients with diastolic dysfunction more sensitive than normal individuals to the effects of tachycardia and loss of atrial contraction, such as occurs with atrial fibrillation. An increase in heart rate shortens the duration of diastole and truncates the important late phase of diastolic filling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1524208463\"><span class=\"h3\">Assessment of diastolic dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinically, diastolic dysfunction is commonly assessed noninvasively by echocardiography. Cardiac catheterization is reserved for cases of suspected HFpEF with indeterminate findings on noninvasive evaluation. Invasive assessment with a high-fidelity micromanometer at rest and during exercise provides the most comprehensive evaluation. Clinical assessment of diastolic dysfunction is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiographic-evaluation-of-left-ventricular-diastolic-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Echocardiographic evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction#H4750683\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction&quot;, section on 'Approach to diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Changes in both afterload (aortic impedance) and diastolic load (LA diastolic pressure) can affect measurements of diastolic function.

A relatively stiff, nondistensible ventricle will require higher pressures to achieve a given volume. Thus, an increase in LV diastolic chamber stiffness (or decrease in distensibility) shifts the diastolic P-V curve upwards, and often also increases its slope.

Simultaneous measurements of LV diastolic pressure are usually made invasively. Alternatively, noninvasive Doppler echocardiographic techniques can be used to estimate pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP).

(See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Normal response to exercise'</a> above.)</p><p>Increased heart rates and cardiac output during exercise require more rapid LV filling. Normally, this is accomplished by accelerated LV relaxation, which lowers LV diastolic pressures and increases the LA-LV pressure gradient. Patients with diastolic dysfunction are not able to increase the rate of LV relaxation as necessary to lower LV diastolic pressure and allow more rapid early diastolic filling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Instead, early diastolic filling is increased by an elevation in LA pressure. The increase in LA pressure may result in pulmonary congestion with exercise, a hallmark of HFpEF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F51956\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51956 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2975548329\"><span class=\"h3\">Decompensated HFpEF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abnormal LV diastolic function is a common underlying finding in patients with HFpEF. Even when clinically compensated, patients with HFpEF have evidence of diastolic dysfunction, with abnormal relaxation, filling, and stiffness and increased diastolic pressures, though in some cases physiologic stressors such as exercise or volume loading are necessary to bring out the abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/38,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,49</a>].

Decompensation into overt HF may be associated with further changes in diastolic relaxation and filling patterns that reduce LV distensibility. The LV diastolic pressure volume relationship is shifted upwards and pulmonary congestion and exercise intolerance may ensue. Alternately, decompensation may be triggered by increases in intravascular volume. These volume-dependent increases in LV diastolic pressure occur along an already steep diastolic pressure-volume curve, and may induce pulmonary congestion without a change in the position or shape of the diastolic pressure-volume curve. Studies have demonstrated that slow and progressive increases in LV diastolic filling pressures often occur over days to weeks preceding any changes in symptoms of signs of HF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F51124\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51124 \">figure 8</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/43,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,52</a>]. Thus, during the transition from compensated to decompensated HFpEF, pathophysiologic changes in diastolic pressure often occur well in advance of the development of clinical symptoms. Because the clinical manifestations of decompensated HF occur late in this transition process and with apparent rapid onset of symptoms, the term &quot;acute&quot; is often added to the term &quot;decompensated HF.&quot; However, while the symptoms of decompensation present acutely, the pathophysiologic processes that underlie the transition from compensated to decompensated HF may not always occur acutely.</p><p>Decompensated HFpEF may be caused by both cardiovascular and noncardiovascular factors (or &quot;triggers&quot;). Such triggers act on preexisting structural and functional abnormalities to precipitate the development of acute decompensated HF. As examples, atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, or uncontrolled hypertension can lead to rapid increases in LA pressures. The abrupt rise in LA pressure causes a significant change in transmitral Doppler flow pattern, and may result in &quot;pseudonormalization.&quot; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiographic-evaluation-of-left-ventricular-diastolic-function#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Echocardiographic evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function&quot;, section on 'Doppler mitral inflow velocity'</a>.)</p><p>Potential triggers for decompensated HFpEF include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/1,54-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,54-61</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uncontrolled hypertension <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> noncompliance with antihypertensive therapies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased salt and water intake <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> noncompliance with diuretic use</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tachyarrhythmias, particularly new onset atrial fibrillation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ischemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Worsening renal function </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic lung disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection</p><p/><p>These comorbidities act upon the substrate to precipitate acute decompensated HFpEF.

Over time, diastolic dysfunction resolves and it is therefore reasonable to refer to this process as post-ischemic diastolic stunning. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients.

The term HFpEF is reserved for patients with clinical HF, in the setting of a normal or near-normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF &ge;50 percent), and abnormalities in diastolic function. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Diastolic dysfunction versus HFpEF'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The LVEF functions as the lynchpin for separating the two types of HF. Patients with HFpEF have an LVEF &ge;50 percent and usually have normal-sized hearts and often display concentric remodeling or hypertrophy. Patients with HFrEF have an LVEF &le;40 percent and display dilated LVs. Patients with HF with midrange LVEF (41 to 49 percent) have some characteristics similar to those with HFrEF and some characteristics similar to those with HFpEF. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'HFpEF versus HFrEF'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During exercise, physiologic mechanisms normally ensure that cardiac input keeps pace with cardiac output with preservation of a low pulmonary venous pressure. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Normal response to exercise'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most conspicuous and commonly present abnormalities in patients with HFpEF are related to diastolic dysfunction. This may present with impairments in relaxation, increases in chamber stiffness, or both. These abnormalities lead to an increase in LV filling pressures at rest or during exercise that causes dyspnea. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Diastolic dysfunction in HFpEF'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since both afterload (systolic pressure) and diastolic load (left atrial diastolic pressure) can affect measurement of diastolic function, these factors must be considered in assessing the intrinsic relaxation rate. (See <a href=\"#H1524208463\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of diastolic dysfunction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to diastolic dysfunction, patients with HFpEF display systolic dysfunction, limitations in systolic reserve, pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular dysfunction, vascular and endothelial abnormalities, chronotropic incompetence, left atrial dysfunction, and abnormalities in the periphery. The complex interplay of all of these pathophysiologic mechanisms is what drives symptoms and worsens outcome in HFpEF. (See <a href=\"#H782154429\" class=\"local\">'Nondiastolic mechanisms in HFpEF'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in ventricular, vascular, and peripheral structure and function causing HFpEF are believed to be related to aging and comorbid conditions that are commonly seen in HFpEF, including hypertension, obesity, insulin resistance, sedentary lifestyle, and coronary artery disease. This interaction may be mediated by low-grade inflammation and loss of nitric oxide availability. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms by which cardiovascular diseases cause HFpEF'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10600308\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The UpToDate editorial staff would&nbsp;like to thank Drs.
