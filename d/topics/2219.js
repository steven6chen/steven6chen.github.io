Mammography may detect cancer one and a half to four years before a cancer becomes clinically evident. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-breast-cancer-evidence-for-effectiveness-and-harms#H3757815\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for breast cancer: Evidence for effectiveness and harms&quot;, section on 'Mammography'</a>.)</p><p>The prototype of the mammography unit was developed in 1965 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Many technical advances have been made since then to improve the image quality, as well as to reduce the radiation dose to the patient. Ongoing technologic advancements, to both enhance mammography and develop other breast imaging modalities, seek to provide earlier diagnosis of breast disease; more accurate assessment of disease extent and treatment response; and improve the detection of recurrence.</p><p>This topic will review mammography technique, performance capabilities of mammography in particular patient groups, interpretation of a mammogram report, and the use of breast ultrasound as an adjunct to mammography. Newer mammography techniques are also discussed. Issues regarding screening for breast cancer, the role of mammography in women with suspected disease, and surveillance for patients with known breast cancer are discussed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for breast cancer: Strategies and recommendations&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-newly-diagnosed-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and staging of newly diagnosed breast cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-following-treatment-for-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient following treatment for breast cancer&quot;</a>). Other imaging techniques for breast disease are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mri-of-the-breast-and-emerging-technologies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;MRI of the breast and emerging technologies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">THE MAMMOGRAPHIC EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A mammogram involves exposing the breast to x-rays. These x-rays are both transmitted through the breast tissue as well as scattered to the surrounding tissue. The x-rays are attenuated based upon the characteristics of the breast tissue, and are then absorbed as latent images on the recording device (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F51636\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51636 \">figure 1</a>). The latent image is processed and displayed for diagnostic purposes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Routine evaluation includes obtaining two views (craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique) of each breast. In the craniocaudal (CC) view (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F65703\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef65703 \">image 1</a>), the breast is lifted and positioned on the plate and compression is applied from above. In the mediolateral oblique (MLO) view (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F75940\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75940 \">image 2</a>), the breast is compressed and imaged from the side. Breast positioning is critical. Improper positioning may lead to exclusion of parts of the breast from the field of view, risking non-visualization of a cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F75653\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75653 \">image 3</a>).</p><p>These two standard views ensure adequate imaging of the relatively mobile inferior and lateral parts and the relatively fixed upper and medial parts of the breast. Obtaining two views for each breast aids in distinguishing overlapping structures from true abnormalities.</p><p>The added benefit of detecting more cancers and lower recall rates with two views outweighs the extra cost and radiation from the second view [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Studies have shown that 11 to 25 percent of cancers could be missed if only one view were obtained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. When circumstances dictate that only one view is to be obtained, the MLO view, which images a greater amount of breast tissue compared to the CC view, is preferred.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Breast compression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adequate breast compression is necessary to obtain good quality mammograms. Compression increases the image contrast and decreases the radiation dose. Since compression causes homogeneous breast thickness, x-ray penetration is uniform through the tissues. Compression also reduces motion and minimizes superimposition of tissues, improving the diagnostic quality of the study (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F74381\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74381 \">image 4</a>).</p><p>Compression ideally should be applied until the breast is held firm and immobile. However, the degree of pain and discomfort experienced during the examination affects the utilization of regular mammography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. One way of making the examination more tolerable is to give patients control over the degree of compression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The utility of patient-controlled compression was evaluated in a study of 109 patients undergoing screening mammography. All women were imaged in the same mammography unit. By random assignment, one breast was compressed by the technologist and the other by the patient. Patient-controlled compression was significantly less painful, and preserved image quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Other attempts to relieve anxiety and discomfort associated with mammography have included use of a soft breast cushion, premedication with oral analgesics, and application of topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> to the breast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/10-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-15</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Premedication with topical 4 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> gel significantly reduced discomfort during screening mammograms in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The topical medication is best applied in the doctor's office by trained medical professionals. The topical anesthetic should be applied sparingly, and not to irritated skin, as case reports of death have been reported when topical anesthetics were applied to large body surface areas for laser hair removal. The US Food and Drug Administration issued an alert in this regard in 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of radiolucent cushions on the compression paddle surface decreased pain in more than 65 percent of 838 women in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Pain decreased by an average of 53 percent compared to the noncushioned breast in those women who experienced pain relief. There was no compromise in image quality.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The purpose of screening mammography is to decrease mortality by identifying early stage breast cancer. There is no evidence that routine screening mammography in women, initiated at age 40, is associated with increased risk from radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>There is concern, however, that women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations are at increased risk for radiation-induced oncogenesis, because of impaired DNA repair mechanisms. For these women, in whom initiation of screening at an early age is usually recommended, the risk of radiation-induced cancer needs to be balanced against the risk of gene-related early onset cancer; the appropriate age to initiate mammogram screening is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-patients-at-high-risk-for-breast-and-ovarian-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of patients at high risk for breast and ovarian cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For all women, it is important to keep the radiation dose as low as possible without compromising image quality. The development of more efficient emulsions and screens in film screen mammography has decreased the dose per exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. Despite technologic improvements, a film screen system does not use all the x-ray photons that pass through the breast. Digital mammography is associated with a lower radiation dose than film screen mammography for the same image quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>].</p><p>The radiation dose absorbed by the breast depends upon the breast tissue thickness, with the dose absorbed increasing with the thickness of the breast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Most mammography equipment delivers a mean glandular dose of 0.1 to 0.2 rads (1 to 2 mGy) per exposure. The American College of Radiology recommends that the mean glandular dose exposure for a breast that is 4.2 cm thick should not exceed 0.3 rads (3 mGy) per image.</p><p>The effective radiation dose is often expressed in sievert or millisievert (mSv) units. Sievert units account for relative sensitivities of different tissues and organs exposed to radiation. The effective dose received from a routine screening mammogram is 0.7 mSv, equivalent to the dose received from natural background radiation over three months. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-related-risks-of-imaging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation-related risks of imaging&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Screen film mammography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mammogram x-rays pass through the breast tissue and are converted to light by fluorescent screens. This light causes a chemical reaction in the film emulsion that is processed and displayed as a grayscale image. In a film screen (analog) mammogram, the image is captured, displayed, and archived for storage in a film [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/2,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,25</a>].</p><p>Film has multiple attributes that make it an appropriate medium for mammography:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High spatial resolution (up to 20 line pairs per millimeter) allows demonstration of microcalcifications, lesion margins, and spiculations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High contrast resolution permits differentiation of subtle differences in soft tissue densities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The film is easily displayed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal areas of the breast image can be masked to improve visualization of abnormalities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple examinations can be viewed on serial view panels.</p><p/><p>However, film screen mammography has a number of disadvantages, compared to full field digital mammography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>] (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Full field digital mammography'</a> below):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A limited dynamic range makes it difficult to image all components of the breast (fat and dense tissue) optimally, and to differentiate between small cancers and surrounding breast tissue of similar density.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The inability to manipulate the image following exposure may lead to retakes and increased radiation dose to the patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Film is subject to artifacts from processing and storage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Films may be misfiled, lost, or otherwise not readily retrievable when comparisons are needed.</p><p/><p>Two standard cassettes 18 x 24 cm and 24 x 30 cm are available to accommodate breasts of different sizes.

Narrow compression paddles (half the width of regular paddle) are also available for women with small breasts and for men.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H242923961\"><span class=\"h2\">Digital mammography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two main types of digital imaging systems used to acquire digital images: direct radiography (DR), where the image is transmitted directly to the radiologist's workstation, and computed radiography (CR), where a cassette-based removable detector is inserted into an external reading device to generate an image. Most centers in the United States use DR systems; however, across the globe, CR systems are widely used as they represent a less expensive option. Studies comparing CR and DR have shown a lower sensitivity for CR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. In one study from Ontario, Canada, CR systems were 38 percent less sensitive than screen-film mammography and 21 percent less effective in detection of cancer compared with direct digital systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. CR systems had fewer false positives compared with DR systems, but there was a trend towards a higher interval cancer rate. Based on this new data, facilities should consider converting to direct digital systems in order to maximize cancer detection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Full field digital mammography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Full field digital mammograms (FFDM) are obtained directly, with digital detectors used in place of film screen systems. The detectors convert the x-ray photons to an electronic signal. This is changed to a digital value with the help of an analog to digital converter.</p><p>The digital image is further processed and displayed as a gray scale image [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/25,27,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,27,31,32</a>].

At two years, the rate of breast cancer detection was significantly higher for those assigned to full field digital mammography compared to film mammography (0.59 and 0.38 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The positive predictive value was the same for both technologies.

Digital mammography, when available, may offer a small screening advantage in women younger than 50 years old. However, in the United States as of 2016, digital mammography is available in lieu of film mammography in 98 percent of imaging centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Modeling studies suggest that for United States women aged 50 to 74 years, biennial digital mammography, compared with film mammography, results in significantly increased costs, increased rates of false-positive findings, and no significant decrease in breast cancer death or total mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H614718010\"><span class=\"h2\">Tomosynthesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breast tomosynthesis (also known as &quot;3-D mammography&quot;) has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for routine clinical use as an adjunct to standard mammography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Tomosynthesis shows promise in screening women with dense breast tissue and high risk for breast cancer, although there are no current universal guidelines on patient selection or frequency of use. Further discussion of tomosynthesis among women with dense breasts is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer#H2565592038\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast density and screening for breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Digital breast tomosynthesis'</a>.)</p><p>Tomosynthesis is a modification of digital mammography and uses a moving x-ray source and digital detector. A three-dimensional volume of data is acquired and reconstructed using computer algorithms to generate thin sections of images. In the diagnostic setting, tomosynthesis improves lesion characterization, increasing rates of cancer detection, and according to most studies, decreasing the false negative rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/50-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-55</a>]. However, because tomosynthesis is typically performed in conjunction with a conventional mammogram and has a longer exposure time per acquisition, the patient is exposed to more radiation (approximately twice the usual radiation dose, which can be even greater if the patient has dense or thick breasts) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. The risk of motion artifact may also be increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. Newer tomosynthesis techniques create a synthetic 2-D image from the 3-D tomosynthesis images, thereby lowering radiation dose to slightly above that of a conventional mammogram. However, upgrading to this technique can be costly for facilities and, therefore, this technology is not widely available to replace a conventional 2-D image. </p><p>Prospective data have suggested increased rates of cancer detection with 3D versus 2D imaging, but conflicting results regarding the effect on false positive rates. At a prespecified interim analysis of the randomized Oslo trial, mammography plus tomosynthesis resulted in a higher cancer detection rate compared with conventional 2-D mammography (6.1 versus 8.0 cases per 1000 screens, respectively) with a lower rate of false positives (5.3 versus 6.1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Reading time required for tomosynthesis interpretation was approximately twice that needed for digital mammography. In a separate, prospective, observational study of 9672 participants, integration of 3D mammography (in combination with either standard or synthetic 2D mammography) detected more cases of breast cancer than 2D mammography alone (8.5 and 8.8 per 1000 screens, respectively, compared with 6.3 per 1000 screens with 2D mammography) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. However, the rates of false-positives with 3D imaging were also higher (4.0 to 4.5 percent versus 3.4 percent with 2D mammography). The improvement over 2D mammography was especially evident among women with dense breasts. Further discussion of screening among women with dense breasts is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer#H2565592038\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast density and screening for breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Digital breast tomosynthesis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer#H16928800\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast density and screening for breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Stratification for supplemental screening/guidelines recommendations'</a>.)</p><p>Retrospective data have suggested increases in the rates of cancer detection and decreases in recall and false positive rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/58,60-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,60-62</a>]. In the largest retrospective study, digital mammography alone (n = 281,187) was compared with digital mammography plus tomosynthesis (n = 173,663) in women from diverse populations in the United States in both community and academic settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. The examinations were performed in two different time periods. Addition of tomosynthesis increased the positive predictive value for recall from 4.3 to 6.4 percent and for biopsy from 24.2 to 29.2 percent. Per 1000 screens, tomosynthesis plus digital mammography was associated with 16 fewer recalls (95% CI 18-14), and 1.2 more invasive cancers detected (95% CI 0.8-1.6). In one study, two-view tomosynthesis performed better than digital mammography only for less-experienced radiologists, but the two techniques had equivalent performance when interpreted by more experienced radiologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. </p><p>Overall, while tomosynthesis shows promise, particularly among those with dense breasts, there are no prospective large studies with survival outcomes to justify its routine use at this time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Online versus offline reading</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At most centers, once the four standard views (two per breast) are obtained, and the image quality is approved by the technologist, the woman leaves the center without knowing the results of the study. The study is later interpreted in batches along with other screening mammograms performed that day. One radiologist usually reads 40 to 60 mammograms as a batch. Written results are conveyed to the referring clinician as well as mailed to the patient. At most centers, the patient is contacted by the radiology department to return for a diagnostic study if additional imaging is required.</p><p>Batch reading offers many advantages. The interpreting radiologist is not interrupted during interpretation by discussions with the technologist or patients between examinations. Batch reading permits double reading, in which each mammogram is reviewed independently by two radiologists. The prior mammograms of the patient are generally made available for comparison during batch interpretation. The availability of prior studies facilitates the evaluation of subtle changes and may decrease the number of false positive results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/65-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">65-67</a>].</p><p>In contrast to batch reading, some centers perform &quot;online reading,&quot; where the mammogram is immediately interpreted by a radiologist. Additional imaging can be performed at the same visit, if needed. Results are conveyed to the patient after the study is completed. Patients report greater satisfaction with this procedure, citing immediate knowledge of their results, having the opportunity to talk to a radiologist on the day of their examination, and reduced anxiety and stress associated with having to return for additional evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>]. In a randomized trial, immediate reading of screening mammograms was associated with less anxiety among women with false positive mammograms three weeks after mammography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p>Online reading also has disadvantages. Immediate interpretation necessitates the presence of a radiologist for the entire session that mammograms are scheduled. The need to immediately perform additional views or an ultrasound, when indicated, disrupts the schedule and results in longer waiting time for the scheduled patients. The added radiologist and technologist time, as well as need for additional equipment and space, increases the cost per examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p>A retrospective analysis of 8698 screening mammograms analyzed the rate of recall and cancer detection between immediate and batch interpretation rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Rates of additional imaging were higher in the group that had immediate reading, but there was no difference in the number of cancers detected between the two groups. The study also found that comparison studies were available less frequently when studies were interpreted immediately following imaging.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Double reading</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Double reading refers to a center whereby two radiologists review every screening mammogram. The aim of double reading is to increase the rate of cancer detection.</p><p>Double reading is standard practice in many European countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/73,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,74</a>], but not in the United States. The examination can be interpreted by the two radiologists either independently or interpreted together in consensus.</p><p>If readers differ in their interpretation of a mammogram study, institutional protocols differ on how this is adjudicated: patients may be called back for follow-up studies if either reader identifies an abnormality (highest reader recall), a third reader may review the films to determine need for follow-up (arbitration), or a group of radiologists, which may or may not include the original readers, discuss the discordant cases (consensus) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. One study found that consensus reading resulted in recall for 45 percent of cases reviewed, with malignancy diagnosed in 11.7 percent of the recalled cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Review of data collected from over 1 million screening examinations in women aged 50 to 69 years participating in the Norwegian Breast Cancer Screening Program, where double reading is standard, found that 23.6 percent of the cancers detected (1326 of 5611) were diagnosed in women who were recalled for discordant interpretations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. About 50 percent of the radiologists in this program were dedicated mammography readers.</p><p>Several studies have demonstrated benefit for double reading but randomized controlled trials have not been performed to evaluate its impact on long term outcomes. Although not all individual studies have demonstrated an effect on cancer detection rates, a meta-analysis of seventeen studies found that cancer detection rates were improved by 10 percent comparing double and single reading (odds ratio [OR] 1.10, 95% CI 1.06-1.14) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. In this analysis, 2222 women would need to be screened by double reading with arbitration for each additional cancer detected. The recall rate for double reading with arbitration, compared to single reading, was decreased (0.94, 0.92-0.96), although the recall rate was increased for double reading without arbitration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. In the United States, most often the second reader is solely looking to identify any abnormality that may have been overlooked by the first radiologist, which does lead to increased recall rates and false-positive examinations but greater cancer detection rates.</p><p>A large trial in the United Kingdom found that vigilance for abnormal mammographic findings did not decrease with time on task [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. No difference was found in rates of breast cancer detection when the order of mammograms read by the second reader was reversed from the first reading or was the same. The trial also found that batch reading (up to 60 mammograms at a session) improved specificity, with fewer recalls but the same cancer detection rate as reading mammograms one by one.</p><p>Double reading increases radiologist time and therefore the cost per examination. There may also be a delay before the final interpretation can be made. Two studies found that both patients and clinicians preferred delayed batch reading with double reading to immediate reading, once the benefits of double reading were explained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/80,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,81</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Computer-aided detection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Computer-aided detection (CAD) refers to computer-based technology designed to recognize mammographic patterns and help radiologists identify suspicious areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. CAD reading of digitalized or digital mammograms places marks in areas of concern, most often calcifications, masses, or asymmetries, for special attention in review by the radiologist; on average, four marks are placed per mammogram. The US Food and Drug Administration approved CAD in 1998 after several studies showed the usefulness of CAD in increasing cancer detection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/83-85\" class=\"abstract_t\">83-85</a>].

When CAD was compared with singly-read mammograms, a small statistically insignificant increase in cancer detection (OR 1.04; 95% CI 0.96-1.13) was found, associated with more false positive readings and higher recall rates (OR 1.10; 1.08-1.12).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The effectiveness of CAD for film-screen mammography was evaluated in a study of mammography results between 1998 and 2006 from centers in seven states participating in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium and involving more than 1.6 million mammograms; CAD was implemented in 25 of the 90 facilities participating in the consortium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].

CAD was associated with increased diagnostic testing (diagnostic mammography, breast ultrasonography, or breast biopsy) in women who did not have a subsequent diagnosis of breast cancer. Follow-up in this study was too short to determine if there was any mortality difference between screening with or without CAD.</p><p/><p>CAD increases the detection of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) as CAD software has increased sensitivity to detect calcifications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/86,91-93\" class=\"abstract_t\">86,91-93</a>]. Since the natural history of DCIS is indolent and uncertain, the benefit of early detection and treatment for this condition is unclear and the potential for over-treatment of preclinical disease is raised. This is of particular concern in older women, with a more limited life expectancy.

The absence of a CAD finding should not negatively influence the radiologist decision to recall a patient for additional studies.</p><p>In summary, CAD may improve the sensitivity of mammographic screening to a limited extent. This may be offset by a higher recall rate, and the potential for overdiagnosis.

It is important to note that the BI-RADS category only refers to the imaging findings and does not take clinical findings or presentation into account. Therefore, if the patient has negative imaging evaluation but has a clinically-suspicious lump, a biopsy may still be indicated even though the BI-RADS category is 1 or 2.</p><p>These categories are designated as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BI-RADS 0: Incomplete assessment &ndash; Need additional imaging evaluation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prior mammograms for comparison &mdash; This category is used when there is not enough information from the views available to derive a conclusion.

The implant contents are radiopaque and can obscure small lesions.

Positioning is important to include as much breast tissue as possible by pushing the implant out of view. Standard CC and MLO projections of each breast are obtained with the implant included (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58154\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef58154 \">image 15</a>). These views permit evaluation of the implant as well as the deep breast tissues adjacent to the implant.

When no breast tissue is left behind, mammography provides no substantial added benefit to clinical examination in detecting recurrence.</p><p>Several methods of reconstruction are available following mastectomy. When silicone implants are used, MRI evaluation for implant-related issues is more sensitive than mammography.</p><p>Reconstruction can also be performed by transfer of tissue from other parts of the body, typically muscle to skin. A TRAM (transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous) flap consists of muscle and fatty tissue from the abdominal wall that is moved up to the chest along with an intact blood supply to create the breast mound. Similar reconstruction can also be performed using the latissimus dorsi muscle. More commonly, DIEP (deep inferior epigastric perforator) flaps, which consist of abdominal fat with its native blood supply, are performed preferentially for breast reconstruction. Identifying breast cancer recurrences in the reconstructed flap is important as it has implications on treatment options.</p><p>At present, physical examination is the method of choice in monitoring myocutaneous breast reconstructions. However, it is difficult to identify lesions that are deep, and can be difficult to distinguish a palpable area of fat necrosis from recurrent cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/142\" class=\"abstract_t\">142</a>].</p><p>Both mammography and ultrasound of a reconstructed breast are technically feasible.

Even when the abnormality seen on a screening mammogram is very suspicious for malignancy, additional evaluation is usually indicated to determine the extent of the lesion and to assess for the presence of any additional findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/168\" class=\"abstract_t\">168</a>]. Availability of the abnormal screening mammogram at the time of diagnostic examination is crucial in ensuring the appropriate diagnostic work-up. This is particularly important when the screening mammogram is performed at a different institution or practice.</p><p>The diagnostic examination is always supervised by a radiologist. The views obtained are tailored to evaluate a specific abnormality, with the adjunctive use of ultrasound if needed in order to make an accurate diagnosis. The radiologist interprets the images and conveys the findings and recommendations directly to the patient at the time of the examination.</p><p>A focal spot compression view, one type of additional view, is performed by applying focal compression to the area of interest in the breast using a small compression paddle. This view is helpful to further evaluate an area of asymmetry or a mass seen on screening mammography (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F78340\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef78340 \">image 22</a>). Spot compression and tangential views of a palpable area have been shown to detect additional cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/169\" class=\"abstract_t\">169</a>].</p><p>A magnification spot compression view is performed to further characterize the morphology of calcifications and shape of a mass. The size, distribution, and morphology of calcifications are seen best on magnification views (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F80031\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80031 \">image 23</a>). In addition, magnification views can provide details regarding margins of masses.</p><p>A 90 degree lateral view is a true lateral view of the breast. The x-ray beam can travel from either the medial (mediolateral) or from the lateral (lateromedial) side of the breast. This view is a direct orthogonal view to the CC (craniocaudal) projection and is useful in triangulating lesions. A delayed lateral view is often performed in evaluating calcifications. The breast is held in compression for up to two minutes and the image is obtained after the two minute &quot;delay.&quot; This view may help in confirming the presence of a benign pattern of calcifications, called milk of calcium deposition, associated with benign breast microcysts.</p><p>Other views that may be obtained in a diagnostic work-up are tangential views, to further evaluate a palpable area or to confirm calcifications are dermal in etiology, and rolled CC views. Rolled views are helpful in confirming that a finding seen only on one of the conventional views represents a true or three-dimensional lesion. For the rolled view, the patient is positioned similar to the view that depicted the original lesion. The technologist places her hands on either side of the breast and &quot;rolls&quot; the breast tissue (medial and lateral for the CC view; superior and inferior for the MLO view). Compression is applied to keep the breast tissues rolled and the image is obtained. The direction of the roll (medial, lateral, superior, or inferior) is documented on the image. If the lesion is &quot;real,&quot; the radiologist can use these images to determine the location of the lesion thereby facilitating performance of a targeted ultrasound.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Surveillance mammogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mammograms are performed for surveillance in women who have a history of breast cancer. In many centers, at least for the five years following the diagnosis of breast cancer, such mammograms are performed similar to diagnostic mammograms, with a radiologist on-site who can interpret the study at the time of the evaluation and determine if further views or tests are indicated. If the patient does not develop recurrence within the first five years, the patient returns to routine screening for subsequent years. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-following-treatment-for-breast-cancer#H560048\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient following treatment for breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Breast imaging'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h1\">ROLE OF ULTRASOUND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the primary roles of ultrasound is in the diagnostic follow-up of an abnormal screening mammogram. Ultrasound is used to further evaluate masses or asymmetries and can differentiate a solid mass from a cyst (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F54203\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54203 \">image 11</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F63321\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63321 \">image 12</a>). If available, color Doppler ultrasound can aid in the assessment of breast masses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/170\" class=\"abstract_t\">170</a>]. However, the absence of flow on Doppler does not exclude the possibility of malignancy.</p><p>Ultrasonography is also used to provide guidance for biopsies and other interventions. Ultrasound is the first line of imaging in a woman who is pregnant or less than 30 years old with focal breast symptoms or findings. A retrospective review of ultrasounds performed in one center for evaluation of focal breast signs or symptoms in women less than 30 years found that both the sensitivity of ultrasound and negative predictive value for malignancy were 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/171\" class=\"abstract_t\">171</a>].</p><p>Ultrasound is useful in evaluating the local extent of breast cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F82348\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef82348 \">image 24</a>). Ultrasound can identify additional tumor in the same breast and alter surgical management in up to 18 percent of women with mammographically detected breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/172-174\" class=\"abstract_t\">172-174</a>]. Evaluation of the axilla in the setting of a newly-diagnosed cancer or a suspicious finding on mammography provides a noninvasive method to identify axillary nodes suspicious for metastasis. If seen, the suspicious nodes can readily undergo image-guided biopsy (FNA or core) to confirm or exclude malignancy, as a positive lymph node would lead to full axillary node dissection rather than sentinel lymph node biopsy at the time of definitive surgical management.</p><p>MRI is superior to ultrasound in evaluating silicone implants for rupture, but ultrasound is often more readily obtained. Ultrasound is appropriate in evaluating implants in a woman with contradictions to MRI or where MRI is not available. Ultrasound can be used to check the integrity of a silicone implant capsule. Leak of silicone to the surrounding breast tissue causes a typical &quot;snowstorm&quot; appearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/175,176\" class=\"abstract_t\">175,176</a>]. Similarly, intracapsular rupture can be diagnosed on ultrasound by a characteristic &quot;stepladder&quot; appearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/177\" class=\"abstract_t\">177</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16209629\"><span class=\"h2\">As adjunct to mammography for screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although whole breast US screening does detect additional early stage breast cancers that are mammographically occult in women with dense breast tissue, the additional screening test carries a substantial risk for false positive results leading to patient anxiety, breast biopsies with benign results, and follow up imaging. The addition of ultrasound to mammogram screening has yet to be shown to reduce breast cancer mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/178\" class=\"abstract_t\">178</a>]. The use of ultrasound as an adjunct to mammography in primary screening for breast cancer is discussed separately.

In a study in which women at some increased risk for breast cancer underwent both standard and stereoscopic digital mammography, the specificity of stereoscopic digital mammography for cancer detection was greater than standard imaging, the sensitivity was the same, and the recall rate for stereoscopic imaging was lower (9.6 versus 12.9 percent for standard imaging) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography/abstract/179\" class=\"abstract_t\">179</a>]. However, the radiation dose for the stereoscopic examination was twice that for standard imaging and it is unknown whether performance characteristics would be maintained if the radiation dose were halved for each of the two images needed for stereoscopic mammography.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

Routine evaluation includes obtaining two views (craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique) of each breast. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'The mammographic examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breast compression improves image quality. Patient-controlled compression, oral or topical analgesics, and cushioned paddles may minimize discomfort. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Breast compression'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The effective radiation dose received from a routine screening mammogram is equivalent to the dose received from natural background radiation over three months. Women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations may be at somewhat greater risk for radiation-induced cancer. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Radiation dose'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Full field digital mammography, compared to film mammography, can improve image quality and facilitate study interpretation, but is more costly and may not significantly impact overall cancer detection rates. Film mammography remains an acceptable screening modality for all women. Digital mammography, when available, may offer a small screening advantage in women younger than 50 years old. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Digital versus screen film mammogram'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Double-reading and computer-aided detection (CAD) may improve the sensitivity of mammogram screening to a limited extent, but have not been demonstrated to improve mortality rates from breast cancer screening. CAD may increase patient recall rates. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Double reading'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Computer-aided detection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnostic mammograms are performed to evaluate breast abnormalities (symptoms, clinical findings or follow-up of abnormal screening mammograms) and are distinguished from screening mammograms. Additional views are obtained with diagnostic mammograms and these are performed when a radiologist is immediately available for review of the study. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Screening versus diagnostic mammography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased breast density both increases the risk of breast cancer and decreases the sensitivity of mammography to detect small lesions. Our approach is to offer primary screening with tomosynthesis to women with dense breasts. Women should be counseled regarding insurance coverage of this screening exam. Further discussion of tomosynthesis among women with dense breasts is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-density-and-screening-for-breast-cancer#H2565592038\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast density and screening for breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Digital breast tomosynthesis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women who have breast tissue augmented with implants require routine screening mammography to evaluate the native breast tissue. Women with reconstructed breasts and no underlying breast tissue do not require regular mammography. Standard imaging technique in women with breast implants involves four views, rather than the usual two per breast. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Women with breast implants'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) standardizes reporting for mammography and ultrasonography and helps guide decision making. It also serves as a useful tool in data collection and audit. The summary of a BI-RADS report specifies findings as incomplete or as one of six final assessment categories (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F100197\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100197 \">table 1</a>). A negative mammogram should not deter further intervention if there is clinical suspicion for malignancy. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Mammography quality control'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultrasound primarily has a diagnostic role in the further evaluation of abnormal mammograms, to distinguish solid and cystic lesions. It is first-line imaging in women who are pregnant or less than 30 years old with focal breast symptoms. Ultrasound may be used as an adjunct to mammography in women with increased breast density, but this approach increases the risk for false-positive findings leading to breast biopsies and follow-up imaging and has not been shown to decrease mortality from breast cancer.
