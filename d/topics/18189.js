Traditionally, TLE has been classified as a subset of chronic cutaneous LE. However, the classification of TLE is controversial. </p><p>TLE is generally a skin-limited disorder that responds well to photoprotection plus topical treatment or oral antimalarial therapy. Unlike other subtypes of cutaneous LE, associated systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is rare. </p><p>The clinical features, diagnosis, and management of TLE will be reviewed here. Other manifestations of cutaneous LE are reviewed separately.

The exact prevalence and incidence are unknown. </p><p>Unlike systemic lupus erythematosus, which exhibits a strong female predominance, TLE affects women and men nearly equally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Some studies have found a slight male predominance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The age-of-onset for TLE varies widely but is often around 30 to 40 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. TLE in infancy and childhood is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Most reports of TLE involve Caucasians; however, the distribution of TLE amongst different racial and ethnic populations is not known. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3818429333\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of TLE is unclear. Ultraviolet (UV) light exposure, immune system dysregulation, and other factors may contribute to the development of TLE.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ultraviolet light </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>UV irradiation can trigger clinical manifestations of TLE. The mechanism may involve induction of keratinocyte apoptosis and impaired clearance of apoptotic cells, as well as the induction of externalization of autoantigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The photosensitive nature of TLE has been verified through phototesting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. In a review of phototesting results from 32 patients with clinical manifestations of TLE, 81 percent demonstrated photosensitivity, a higher prevalence than seen in patients with discoid lupus erythematosus, subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, or systemic lupus erythematosus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In addition, for 22 patients (69 percent), provocative phototesting with ultraviolet A (UVA) or ultraviolet B (UVB) light produced lesions with clinical and histologic findings consistent with lupus erythematosus (LE). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cutaneous-photosensitivity-photobiology-patient-evaluation-and-photoprotection#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cutaneous photosensitivity: Photobiology, patient evaluation, and photoprotection&quot;, section on 'Phototesting'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The induction of TLE following exposure to UV light can be delayed, making it difficult for patients to associate exacerbations of TLE with sun exposure. In a study of 60 patients with TLE, phototesting provoked characteristic TLE lesions in 72 percent of patients with a mean time to induction of TLE of 7.5 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Some inductions occurred more than 21 days after phototesting. Further, in an analysis of 40 patients with TLE in which provocative phototesting elicited characteristic lesions in 70 percent, 12 of the 20 patients (60 percent) who denied a history of photosensitivity had pathologic test reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Immune system dysregulation </strong>&ndash; Dysregulation of the immune system, particularly of T cell subsets, is postulated to contribute to TLE. A study of 39 patients with cutaneous LE (including 21 patients with TLE) found a significant decrease in T regulatory cells in patients with TLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Other immune alterations found in subtypes of cutaneous LE include decreased epidermal Langerhans cells, increased plasmacytoid dendritic cells, upregulated type I interferon and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and the detection of Th17 cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other factors </strong>&ndash; Increased frequency of smoking compared with the general population has been reported among patients with TLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In addition, there are rare reports of drug-induced TLE. Examples include TLE secondary to anti-TNF-alpha agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>], a thiazide diuretic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], highly active antiretroviral therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. A TLE-like eruption to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ustekinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ustekinumab</a> also has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. TLE following sex reassignment surgery has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2806263543\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cutaneous manifestations of lupus erythematosus (LE) are divided into LE-specific skin disease and LE-nonspecific skin disease. The three major subtypes of LE-specific skin disease are acute, subacute, and chronic cutaneous LE (CCLE). Traditionally, TLE has been classified as a subtype of CCLE (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F93804\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93804 \">table 1</a>). However, this classification is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/3,16,22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,16,22-25</a>]. Some authors propose classifying TLE as a distinct subtype of cutaneous LE (ie, intermittent cutaneous LE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/16,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,22</a>], while others question the inclusion of TLE along the LE spectrum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cutaneous-lupus-erythematosus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cutaneous lupus erythematosus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Key features used to support a distinction between TLE and CCLE include the following features of TLE:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exquisite photosensitivity (greater than in CCLE)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of common features of CCLE, including atrophy, scarring, and dyspigmentation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frequent absence of common histologic features of CCLE, including epidermal involvement, interface dermatitis, and hair follicle alteration</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More prominent mucin deposition than in discoid lupus erythematosus (the most common type of CCLE)</p><p/><p>Additional distinctions between TLE and other LE-specific skin diseases include the rarity of associated systemic LE and the less frequent detection of anti-double stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies, <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-Ro/SSA,</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-La/SSB</span> antibodies in patients with TLE (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F109668\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef109668 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Moreover, TLE generally has a more favorable prognosis than other types of cutaneous LE. (See <a href=\"#H3959737066\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> below and <a href=\"#H178553529\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H142940315\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TLE classically manifests as asymptomatic, erythematous, edematous plaques without scale or ulceration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F110572%7EDERM%2F110574%7EDERM%2F110575\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef110572 graphicRef110574 graphicRef110575 \">picture 1A-C</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Unlike discoid lupus erythematosus, there is a lack of follicular plugging, atrophy, or scarring. TLE tends to involve exposed areas of skin, such as the face, upper back, upper chest (V-neck distribution), extensor arms, and shoulders. However, there are rare reports of TLE involving the lower extremities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In temperate climates, TLE most often occurs during the summer months.</p><p>In some patients, papules and plaques of TLE appear less edematous at the center, forming an annular configuration that may mimic annular subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE). A lack of scale and lack of resolution with dyspigmentation distinguishes TLE from SCLE. Less common manifestations of TLE include a Blaschkoid distribution (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57219\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57219 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>], scalp involvement mimicking alopecia areata [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], and periorbital edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p>TLE tends to persist for days or weeks and typically follows a chronic recurring pattern. TLE heals without scarring, atrophy, or dyspigmentation; such features should raise suspicion for an alternative diagnosis of discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) or concomitant DLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/1,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,31</a>]. Spontaneous resolution is possible. (See <a href=\"#H178553529\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3959737066\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the majority of patients with TLE, antinuclear antibodies (ANA) will be negative. ANA positivity may occur in less than 20 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/1,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,32,33</a>]. In rare cases, other serologies (such as anti-double stranded DNA, <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-Ro/SSA,</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-La/SSA</span> antibodies) are positive, or complement levels are decreased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>A potential association between higher serum homocysteine levels and cutaneous lupus erythematosus has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Further data are necessary to clarify the relationship between serum homocysteine levels and TLE.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2129275827\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSOCIATION WITH SLE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Coexistence of TLE and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. No occurrences of SLE in patients with TLE were documented in several retrospective studies with 14 to 40 patients with TLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/1,32,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,32,35</a>]. Examples of the rare reports of systemic disease include a prospective study that found evidence of SLE in 1 of 15 patients with TLE who were followed for a mean of seven years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>] and a retrospective study that found evidence of SLE in 2 of 15 patients with TLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H221954445\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOPATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TLE is characterized by a dermal perivascular and periadnexal lymphocytic infiltrate. Interstitial mucin deposition is often abundant in the dermis. Papillary dermal edema is common. </p><p>Classically, there is a lack of involvement of the epidermis and the dermal-epidermal junction. However, there are reports of minor involvement of the epidermis in patients with TLE, prompting some authors to question whether an absence of epidermal alterations should be considered a consistent feature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In a retrospective review of 26 patients with TLE, minimal epidermal changes (epidermal atrophy, vacuolar degeneration of basal cells, hyperkeratosis) and minimal follicular plugging were present in skin biopsy specimens of 18 patients, and specimens from 11 patients showed an enhanced and irregular basement membrane at the dermal-epidermal junction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Additionally, in a retrospective review of 25 patients, mild epidermal alterations, most frequently focal basal vacuolization, were observed in 52 percent of tissue biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p>Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) studies are typically negative but may be positive in up to 50 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/16,31,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,31,36,37</a>]. When DIF studies are positive, generally immunoglobulin G (IgG) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> immunoglobulin M (IgM) are seen along the dermoepidermal junction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/16,31,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,31,37</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4197706067\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of TLE is established based upon the recognition of consistent clinical manifestations and histopathologic findings. TLE should be suspected in patients presenting with erythematous, edematous, smooth plaques, particularly when located in photo-exposed areas on the face, upper trunk, or upper extremities. A skin biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. </p><p>Other tests that are not typically necessary, but can support a diagnosis of TLE, are the results of provocative phototesting and the response to antimalarial treatment. Key findings in TLE are reflected in proposed diagnostic criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F110569\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110569 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cutaneous-photosensitivity-photobiology-patient-evaluation-and-photoprotection#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cutaneous photosensitivity: Photobiology, patient evaluation, and photoprotection&quot;, section on 'Phototesting'</a>.)</p><p>Serologic evaluation is not helpful in establishing the diagnosis of TLE. However, given the rare association of TLE with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a thorough history, review of systems, and physical examination should be performed at the time of diagnosis to evaluate for signs or symptoms of SLE. Serologic evaluation including antinuclear antibodies should be performed in patients with signs or symptoms suggestive of SLE. (See <a href=\"#H3959737066\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2129275827\" class=\"local\">'Association with SLE'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1926068859\"><span class=\"h2\">History and physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical evaluation of patients with suspected TLE should include a full skin examination with particular attention to the head, neck, chest, back, and arms. A photodistributed eruption of smooth, erythematous plaques that lack associated scale, atrophy, scarring, and dyspigmentation is consistent with TLE. Lower extremity involvement is rare. (See <a href=\"#H142940315\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p>When asked, patients with TLE may report an association between exacerbations of skin disease and sun exposure. However, given that exacerbations may occur days to a few weeks after sun exposure, not all patients recognize an association. (See <a href=\"#H3818429333\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1433927073\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The skin biopsy should be taken from an active, erythematous plaque. A 4 mm punch biopsy is typically performed and should include the full thickness of the dermis. A 3 mm punch biopsy may be sufficient and is an alternative for cosmetically-sensitive areas such as the face. The classic histologic findings of TLE are a dermal perivascular and periadnexal lymphocytic infiltrate with abundant interstitial mucin. (See <a href=\"#H221954445\" class=\"local\">'Histopathology'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3782431269\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TLE can be confused with other disorders that may present with erythematous, smooth plaques on the upper body, such as Jessner&rsquo;s lymphocytic infiltrate (JLI), polymorphic light eruption (PMLE), reticular erythematous mucinosis (REM), and pseudolymphoma. The most challenging distinction is between TLE and JLI.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Jessner&rsquo;s lymphocytic infiltrate </strong>&ndash; JLI is a rare disorder often considered to exist along a spectrum with TLE. The clinical appearance of TLE and JLI can be remarkably similar. JLI tends to present with erythematous, dermal papules or nodules without scale, generally involving the face or upper back (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F76268%7EDERM%2F62419\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76268 graphicRef62419 \">picture 2A-B</a>). Similar to TLE, patients with JLI may have positive antinuclear antibodies and direct immunofluorescence studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=jessners-lymphocytic-infiltrate\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Jessner's lymphocytic infiltrate&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There is significant overlap in the histologic findings of JLI and TLE. Although more abundant mucin in the dermis in TLE has been proposed as a distinguishing factor, a blinded histologic review of 33 biopsy specimens from patients diagnosed with TLE or JLI found only slight epidermal atrophy more common in TLE after a reclassification of specimens during expert histologic review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Polymorphous light eruption </strong>&ndash; PMLE most often presents as photodistributed, pruritic, erythematous or skin-colored papules or plaques (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F95454%7EDERM%2F64270\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef95454 graphicRef64270 \">picture 3A-B</a>). The skin manifestations typically appear hours after sun exposure, though longer delays can occur. The course of PMLE tends to be shorter than TLE; PMLE usually resolves within several days if sun exposure is avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Unlike TLE, exacerbations of PMLE tend to lessen with sequential exposures to ultraviolet light (ie, the &quot;hardening&quot; effect). Therefore, PMLE tends to be most severe in the spring. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polymorphous-light-eruption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Polymorphous light eruption&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Reticular erythematous mucinosis </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>REM primarily affects young to middle-aged women. REM most often occurs on the chest and upper back as reticulated macular erythema or reticulated erythematous plaques (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F110782\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef110782 \">picture 4</a>). Histologic features are similar to TLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. A study comparing the immunohistochemical and histopathologic features of REM with TLE found that in REM, lymphocytes were more scattered and more superficial, and mucin deposition was more superficial in the dermis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumid-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In addition, in REM, immunoglobulin and complement deposition along the dermoepidermal junction was seen less frequently, and there were fewer plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Some clinicians consider REM a variant of TLE or discoid lupus erythematosus. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pseudolymphoma </strong>&ndash; Cutaneous pseudolymphoma has a variable clinical presentation but may present with a single or multiple erythematous dermal nodules, typically occurring on the face, chest, or upper extremities. The condition is not photosensitive, and nodules or plaques tend to persist without treatment. Histopathology readily distinguishes cutaneous pseudolymphoma from TLE. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cutaneous-b-cell-pseudolymphomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cutaneous B cell pseudolymphomas&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cutaneous-t-cell-pseudolymphomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cutaneous T cell pseudolymphomas&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2009948551\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TLE is a benign, typically asymptomatic condition that may spontaneously resolve over time. However, TLE can be disfiguring and spontaneous resolution is unpredictable. Therefore, most patients desire treatment.

Thus, long-term treatment is often warranted. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2936310318\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tumid lupus erythematosus (TLE) is an uncommon manifestation of cutaneous lupus erythematosus (cutaneous LE). TLE traditionally has been classified as a subtype of chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus; however, the classification of TLE within the spectrum of cutaneous LE is controversial. (See <a href=\"#H2806263543\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TLE most often occurs in adult men and women. Pediatric TLE is rare. (See <a href=\"#H2459521508\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathogenesis of TLE is unclear. Ultraviolet light can trigger exacerbations of TLE, suggesting an important role for ultraviolet light exposure. Immune dysregulation may be another important contributor to the development of TLE. (See <a href=\"#H3818429333\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The classic clinical manifestations of TLE are erythematous, edematous, smooth plaques (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F110572%7EDERM%2F110574%7EDERM%2F110575\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef110572 graphicRef110574 graphicRef110575 \">picture 1A-C</a>). TLE usually occurs on the face, upper chest, upper back, shoulders, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> extensor surfaces of the arms. Lower extremity involvement is rare. Scale, atrophy, scarring, and dyspigmentation are not features of TLE and should raise suspicion for an alternative diagnosis of discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) or concomitant DLE. (See <a href=\"#H142940315\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antinuclear antibodies are negative in the majority of patients with TLE, and the occurrence of systemic lupus erythematosus in patients with TLE is rare. (See <a href=\"#H3959737066\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2129275827\" class=\"local\">'Association with SLE'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of TLE can be made based upon the recognition of consistent clinical and histologic findings. Disorders often in the differential diagnosis include Jessner&rsquo;s lymphocytic infiltrate, polymorphous light eruption, reticular erythematous mucinosis, and pseudolymphoma. (See <a href=\"#H4197706067\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3782431269\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The extent of TLE influences the approach to the treatment. We suggest topical corticosteroid therapy rather than systemic therapy as initial treatment for patients with limited TLE (eg, one to several small plaques) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Alternative local therapies include intralesional corticosteroid injections and topical calcineurin inhibitors. (See <a href=\"#H482285141\" class=\"local\">'Limited disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with widespread TLE or with limited disease that is refractory to local therapy, we suggest treatment with a systemic antimalarial drug (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Patients may be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloroquine</a>. Hydroxychloroquine is generally preferred because of a more favorable side effect profile. (See <a href=\"#H1658731704\" class=\"local\">'Extensive disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TLE refractory to antimalarial therapy is uncommon. Patients with refractory TLE may benefit from treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thalidomide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a>, or other agents.
