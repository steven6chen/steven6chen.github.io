It is particularly useful in gynecologic practice for the evaluation of operative lower urinary tract injury. The use of cystourethroscopy to examine the female urethra and bladder was introduced in 1805 by Dr. Philipp Bozzini in Germany and visualization was improved in 1894 by Dr. Howard Kelly, a gynecologist in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-cystourethroscopy-for-gynecologic-conditions/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Currently, cystourethroscopy training is provided in most, but not all, United States gynecology residency programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-cystourethroscopy-for-gynecologic-conditions/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. </p><p>The female genital and lower urinary tracts are closely related anatomically and embryologically. Thus, many conditions or procedures affect both of these tracts. Examples of this include: urinary incontinence associated with pelvic organ prolapse, urogenital fistula, metastases of gynecologic malignancies, endometriosis, and hysterectomy or pelvic reconstructive procedures. </p><p>Cystourethroscopy is commonly referred to as cystoscopy, and this term will be used in this review.</p><p>Use of cystourethroscopy for evaluation of lower urinary tract injury for gynecologic indications is reviewed here. Prevention, evaluation, and management of lower urinary tract injury in gynecologic surgery, as well as placement or ureteral stents, are reviewed separately.

These overlap with some, but not all, urologic indications for cystoscopy. </p><p>Cystoscopy is performed for women with gynecologic conditions for evaluation of [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-cystourethroscopy-for-gynecologic-conditions/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suspected operative urinary tract injury (eg, ureteral injury, cystotomy, intravesical placement or erosion of mesh or suture) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinary urgency or frequency or urgency incontinence in the absence of urinary tract infection </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suspected urinary tract involvement by endometriosis or gynecologic malignancies </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leakage of urine from the vagina (etiology may be a genitourinary fistula) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suspected involvement of the urinary tract following lower genital tract trauma &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postvoid dribbling of urine (etiology may be a urethral diverticulum) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injection of therapeutic agents for urinary incontinence (eg, periurethral bulking agents, botulinum toxin)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Verification of suprapubic catheter placement </p><p/><p>Lower urinary tract injury occurs in approximately 1 percent of all pelvic surgeries in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-cystourethroscopy-for-gynecologic-conditions/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, this number rises to 4.3 percent after hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-cystourethroscopy-for-gynecologic-conditions/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Hysterectomy, anti-incontinence procedures, and vaginal apical suspension procedures (uterosacral ligament suspension) are the surgeries most likely to be associated with lower urinary tract injury. Gynecologic surgeons should perform cystoscopy upon suspicion of injury intra- or postoperatively; some experts advise routine cystoscopy following surgical treatment of urinary incontinence, anterior or apical pelvic organ prolapse, and hysterectomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-epidemiology-and-prevention#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract injury in gynecologic surgery: Epidemiology and prevention&quot;, section on 'Type of procedure'</a>.)</p><p>Cystoscopy may also be used to evaluate women who have undergone anti-incontinence procedures or other gynecologic surgery who develop urinary tract symptoms. For these women, new onset of irritative storage symptoms (urinary frequency, urgency, urgency incontinence in the absence of urinary tract infection), hematuria, or recurrent urinary tract infections may be symptoms of surgical mesh or suture erosion or genitourinary fistula. </p><p>Women with pelvic organ prolapse often also have irritative storage symptoms. Cystoscopy may be used in these women to exclude urethral diverticula, bladder tumors, bladder stones, bladder scarring, and findings associated with interstitial cystitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-cystourethroscopy-for-gynecologic-conditions/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Cystoscopy should also be considered in women with irritative storage symptoms of new onset, not responsive to medications, frequent urinary tract infections, history of prior surgeries, or risk factors such as pelvic radiation or smoking.

Cystoscopy for this indication is usually performed by urologists, but may be performed by a gynecologist if there are other gynecologic indications for the procedure. During any cystoscopy procedure, even in the absence of hematuria, any findings suspicious for malignancy should be biopsied.

A focused evaluation should be performed to guide the procedure and to assess procedural risk. This includes eliciting a history of symptoms associated with the indication for the procedure, a personal or family history of urinary tract abnormalities, and any comorbidities that may increase procedural risk. In addition, an abdominal and pelvic examination should be performed, with particular attention to the condition and position of the urethral meatus. </p><p>In addition, urinary tract infection should be excluded (see <a href=\"#H22000641\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above). One may obtain a urine sample by voiding or straight catheterization on the day of the procedure and perform a dipstick test for leukocyte esterase and nitrite. If the results are positive, send a urine culture and defer the procedure. Some surgeons perform a urine culture several days before the procedure and treat patients with bacteriuria with antibiotics.

Randomized studies of rigid cystourethroscopy in women conflict regarding whether perioperative discomfort is decreased with use of anesthetic gel compared with plain lubricating gel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-cystourethroscopy-for-gynecologic-conditions/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].</p><p>We use 2 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> gel that is typically supplied in single-use prefilled syringes. The syringe is inserted into the mid-urethra using additional gel as a lubricant. The gel is slowly injected; the procedure can be started after 5 to 15 minutes have elapsed.</p><p>Sedation or regional or general anesthesia for this procedure may be used, based upon the preferences of the physician or patient and upon whether an operative procedure will be performed. In our practice, we usually do not use sedation for diagnostic procedures, unless biopsies are performed. For collagen injection or intravesical administration of botulinum toxin, we perform a vesical instillation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>.

The degree indicates the deflection of the lens, similar to other endoscopic procedures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F58867\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58867 \">figure 1</a>). The choice of viewing angle impacts the ability to visualize different parts of the bladder and urethra. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 70&deg; lens is usually adequate to fully evaluate the bladder surface, trigone, and ureteral orifices, and is the lens used most commonly to evaluate patients during or after gynecologic procedures. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 30&deg; lens may also be used to assess the bladder and is the best choice if a ureteral procedure is performed (eg, stent placement, retrograde pyelogram). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 0&deg; lens is used to examine the urethra. </p><p/><p>Cystoscopy can be performed by looking directly into the lens or connecting the lens to a camera attached to a video monitor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F83049\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83049 \">picture 1</a>). The use of a camera and monitor facilitates teaching of surgical trainees. &#160;</p><p>The sheath of the cystoscope holds has channels to allow fluid inflow and outflow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F83017\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83017 \">picture 2</a>). Diagnostic cystoscopy can generally be performed with a size 17 French sheath. This is generally the smallest diameter sheath used in adults and provides optimal patient comfort; however, it is not large enough for an instrument port. The 21 French sheath is the preferred size for most operative procedures performed for gynecologic indications, allowing easy passage of ureteral guidewires and stents, as well as flexible biopsy forceps and electrosurgical instruments. </p><p>The bridge connects the lens to the sheath and can have one or more ports that allow insertion of operative instruments (eg, biopsy forceps, ureteral guidewires, ureteral stents). The size of the instrument that can be passed is limited by the size of the port. One type of bridge (Albarran bridge) allows deflection of instruments, which facilitates fulguration, biopsy, or passing of a ureteral guidewire, particular for bladder dome lesions or patients with distorted anatomy. </p><p>The lens is attached to a light source (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F83018\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83018 \">picture 3</a>). Various light sources can be used and vary depending upon the equipment available. Most modern light sources allow adjustment of the intensity of the light to permit optimal visualization.</p><p>Cystoscopy can be performed using either a rigid or flexible cystoscope. Advantages of using a rigid cystoscope (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F83076\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83076 \">picture 4</a>) include better optics and larger working and fluid channels. In addition, a rigid cystoscope is easier to orient to ensure complete bladder visualization. Most cystoscopies done for gynecologic office assessment and procedures use a rigid cystoscope. Flexible cystoscopes are advantageous for bedside assessment of hematuria in fresh postoperative or postpartum patients because of their increased ability to be manipulated and less dependence on patient positioning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22000739\"><span class=\"h2\">Distending medium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A distention medium is instilled to distend the bladder and improve visualization. The usual distending medium for diagnostic cystoscopy is isotonic saline or sterile water. </p><p>If electrosurgery is planned, it is necessary to use nonconductive solutions (electrolyte-poor fluids, eg, water, glycine) to avoid dispersing the electrical current and thus rendering the instruments ineffective. Use of any distending medium for operative purposes requires monitoring of fluid absorption to avoid volume overload and possible hyponatremia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyponatremia-following-transurethral-resection-or-hysteroscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyponatremia following transurethral resection or hysteroscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Distending media for cystoscopy are the same as for hysteroscopy. Types of distending media are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71692\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71692 \">table 2</a>). The use of distending media is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hysteroscopy-managing-fluid-and-gas-distending-media\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hysteroscopy: Managing fluid and gas distending media&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H461325\"><span class=\"h1\">PROCEDURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cystoscopy is typically a brief procedure (5 to 15 minutes), but may be longer if any additional procedures are performed. The surgical technique is similar in many ways to hysteroscopy. </p><p>Prior to starting the procedure, the surgeon should check that all of the equipment is present, assembled, and functioning properly (see <a href=\"#H22000705\" class=\"local\">'Instrumentation'</a> above).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H732323\"><span class=\"h2\">Inserting the cystoscope</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The steps of a cystoscopy procedure are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient is placed in the dorsal lithotomy position. In an office setting, patients are covered with a sheet and the urethral meatus is cleaned with a sterile solution (eg, iodine). In the operating room, the vagina and perineum are cleaned with a sterile solution and surgical drapes are placed. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A sterile lubricant is placed on the cystoscope sheath and the fluid inflow is opened. The cystoscopic lens and sheath are inserted into the urethra with the angle of the lens directed towards the ceiling. Insertion of the cystoscope is usually done under direct visualization, although an obturator may be used if there is difficulty cannulating the urethra meatus such as in a patient with urethral obstruction or tumor. Attention should be given to the angle of the urethra. The normal angle is slightly upward under the pubic bone. For women with pelvic organ prolapse, it is helpful to reduce the prolapse prior to performing cystoscopy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If urethral pathology is suspected, the urethra is examined (see <a href=\"#H21999819\" class=\"local\">'Urethra'</a> below). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cystoscope is then advanced past the urethrovesical junction until an air bubble is visualized in the anterior dome of the bladder. The air bubble is oriented at the superior aspect of the bladder and, thus, is useful for establishing orientation. The bladder and ureteral orifices are examined and biopsies and other procedures are performed, as appropriate (see <a href=\"#H21999826\" class=\"local\">'Bladder'</a> below and <a href=\"#H21999856\" class=\"local\">'Ureteral orifices'</a> below).</p><p/><p>Anterior or apical pelvic organ prolapse or prior pelvic surgery may distort the bladder anatomy, making cystoscopy more difficult. Placing the surgeon&rsquo;s nondominant hand or an obturator in the vagina to support the anterior wall of the vagina will assist in placing the cystoscope and visualizing the urothelium, trigone and ureteral orifices.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21999810\"><span class=\"h2\">Examining the lower urinary tract</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21999819\"><span class=\"h3\">Urethra</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>First, the urethral meatus is examined. The urethral mucosa is then examined for erythema, pallor, exudate, polyps, condylomata, or diverticula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-cystourethroscopy-for-gynecologic-conditions/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The presence of an exudate suggests the presence of a diverticulum, although this is rarely visualized during urethroscopy. At the time of cystourethroscopy, the surgeon can use a 0-degree lens to attempt to visualize a diverticular ostium. However, the diverticulum is often palpated vaginally but not seen during urethral evaluation. In addition, the urethrovesical junction is also examined for polyps. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urethral-diverticulum-in-women#H2637536\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urethral diverticulum in women&quot;, section on 'Urethroscopy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21999826\"><span class=\"h3\">Bladder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The entire urothelial surface should be inspected for perforation, suture or mesh, adhesions, erythema, edema, lesions, or masses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-cystourethroscopy-for-gynecologic-conditions/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. As noted above, a 70&deg; lens is typically used. The cystoscope is rotated and inserted and withdrawn to visualize all areas. Slight suprapubic pressure can facilitate visualization of the anterior bladder wall just behind the bladder neck. (See <a href=\"#H22000714\" class=\"local\">'Cystoscope'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21999842\"><span class=\"h4\">Identifying bladder injury or erosion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If sutures or reconstructive materials (mesh or biografts) that have eroded or were inadvertently placed in the bladder from incontinence <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prolapse surgery are found, these should be removed. The bladder should then be reinspected and any bleeding sites should be cauterized and repaired. Most cystotomies at the time of hysterectomy are located on the bladder base 2 to 3 cm above the trigone. Once a bladder injury is identified, the surgeon must repair the injury. This is ideally done along the same route of access as the initial surgery (ie, vaginal, laparoscopic, or open abdominal approach). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract injury in gynecologic surgery: Identification and management&quot;, section on 'Bladder injury'</a>.) &#160;</p><p>Cystoscopy can detect most, but not all, bladder injuries. A small proportion of cystotomies are missed and devascularization, denervation, or thermal injuries are not identifiable by cystoscopy. The rate of missed diagnoses of clinically important injuries was illustrated in a systematic review of 17 retrospective studies of women who underwent benign gynecologic surgery with routine intraoperative use of cystoscopy, in which women presented with bladder injury postoperatively following 0.8 per 1000 procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-cystourethroscopy-for-gynecologic-conditions/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13310187\"><span class=\"h4\">Evaluating bladder lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bladder biopsy should be performed if lesions are found that are suspicious for a bladder neoplasm or, for patients with potential interstitial <span class=\"nowrap\">cystitis/bladder</span> pain syndrome, lesions that are associated with this condition (eg, Hunner lesions). If the surgeon is not experienced with bladder biopsy or evaluation of bladder tumors, the patient should be referred to a urologist. Characteristics of bladder tumors include a bubble-like appearance to the trigone, bullous edema, frond-like papillary growths, or shaggy, necrotic tissue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F83081\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83081 \">picture 5</a>). </p><p>If urothelial malignancy is suspected, a bladder barbotage (repeated injection and aspiration of fluid) to obtain urothelial cells for cytology should be performed. An isotonic fluid should be used (eg, isotonic saline) since hypotonic fluids (eg, sterile water) will cause the cells to lyse, yielding inaccurate cytology. Glycine may also be used for barbotage, if glycine is the medium of choice for the procedure. (See <a href=\"#H22000739\" class=\"local\">'Distending medium'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21999849\"><span class=\"h4\">Evaluating genitourinary fistula</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cystoscopy with simultaneous vaginal examination may be necessary to find extremely small vesicovaginal fistulas and to assess patients who have failed primary attempts at repair. This is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urogenital-tract-fistulas-in-women#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urogenital tract fistulas in women&quot;, section on 'Cystoscopy and imaging studies'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21999856\"><span class=\"h3\">Ureteral orifices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ureteral orifices are located in the bladder trigone, which is directly in front of the urethra and is identified by locating the interureteric ridge. The cystoscope may need to be rotated to visualize the ureteral orifices. Several minutes of observation may be needed to identify the orifices, which are small, slit-like openings that only become apparent when a burst of urine is released.</p><p>In women in whom the bladder is distorted by tumor or cystocele, a finger placed in the vagina and pressed upward under the bladder base may facilitate visualization of the ureteral openings. Large cervical tumors can cause distortion of the bladder such that the trigone sits in a valley behind the ridge made by the tumor. It is also important to note that in women that have had prior ureteral surgery, the ureteral orifice may be in an ectopic location. In situations where it is difficult to identify the ureteral orifice, coloring the urine with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenazopyridine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenazopyridine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indigo-carmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indigo carmine</a> may be helpful. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21999863\"><span class=\"h4\">Identifying ureteral injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Identification of ureteral injury is aided by coloring the urine, thereby allowing visualization of the urine jet as it flows out of the ureteral orifice and confirming ureteral patency. Agents to color the urine include 10 percent sodium <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorescein</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indigo-carmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indigo carmine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenazopyridine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenazopyridine</a>. The intraoperative evaluation of the bladder and ureters is presented separately.

In addition, if urinary tract malignancy is suspected, consultation may be required for biopsy and follow-up evaluation and management. The authors recommend that urologic or urogynecologic consultation should be obtained anytime there is concern about what is visualized.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H462087\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications of cystoscopy are rare. This was illustrated in a retrospective study of 101 women who underwent cystoscopy immediately following pelvic surgery, which reported only one complication associated with operative cystoscopy (a thermal injury) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-cystourethroscopy-for-gynecologic-conditions/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3741216\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reported incidence of bacteriuria following cystourethroscopy is 5 to 8 percent; the incidence of symptomatic urinary tract infection is approximately 2 to 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-cystourethroscopy-for-gynecologic-conditions/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. Bacteremia is possible after cystoscopy, but reports of sepsis following cystoscopy are rare and involve patients with risk factors for urinary tract infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-cystourethroscopy-for-gynecologic-conditions/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p>For women with postoperative symptoms of urinary tract infection, a urine culture should be sent and infection appropriately treated. Asymptomatic women who have findings on cystoscopy suggestive of infection (eg, exudate) should be treated with antibiotics after the procedure. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3741223\"><span class=\"h2\">Urethral or bladder injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no data regarding the incidence of urethral or bladder injury in diagnostic cystourethroscopy. Minor injuries with a small amount of bleeding can be controlled with electrosurgery. Perforation of the bladder or urethra may require placement of a urinary catheter or abdominal or laparoscopic surgery for repair; however, this is extremely rare. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3741230\"><span class=\"h2\">Other complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemorrhage after cystoscopy is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-cystourethroscopy-for-gynecologic-conditions/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H732095\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients experience mild postprocedure urinary urgency or dysuria and a small amount of hematuria that should clear within three voids. The patient may resume most normal activities as soon as anesthetic effects, if used, have resolved. We advise patients to call their surgeon if they have urethral bleeding that is heavy or lasts for more than five days or if they develop persistent suprapubic pain, dysuria, urinary urgency, urinary frequency, or fever.</p><p>We review the results with patients immediately after the procedure if only topical or regional anesthetic was used. We see patients for a follow-up visit two weeks postoperatively if they were under sedation or general anesthesia or have biopsy results pending.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H732104\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnostic cystoscopy is an endoscopic technique for examining the internal aspect of the urethra and bladder and assessing ureteral patency. (See <a href=\"#H12637557\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gynecologic indications for cystoscopy include: evaluation of urogynecologic symptoms, assessment of bladder and ureteral involvement by gynecologic malignancies, and identification of urinary tract injuries during or after gynecologic procedures. (See <a href=\"#H13424516\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women undergoing cystoscopy who do not receive regional or general anesthesia, we suggest the use of a topical urethral anesthetic prior to the procedure rather than no topical anesthetic (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H22001163\" class=\"local\">'Anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An electrolyte-containing irrigation fluid or sterile water is used for diagnostic cystoscopy. If barbotage is done, sterile water is not appropriate. (See <a href=\"#H22000739\" class=\"local\">'Distending medium'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cystoscopy does not detect all bladder or ureteral injuries; approximately 1 injury will be missed for every 1000 procedures, depending on the type of gynecologic procedure performed. (See <a href=\"#H21999810\" class=\"local\">'Examining the lower urinary tract'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following cystoscopy, mild postprocedure hematuria and dysuria are normal and should clear within several voids. Potential complications include urinary tract infection and injury to the urethra or bladder.
