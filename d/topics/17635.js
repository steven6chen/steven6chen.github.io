Furthermore, modern ETs appear to prolong progression and possibly survival compared with older ETs. However, few if any patients with metastatic breast cancer will be cured, and the goal of therapy is, principally, palliation. We make efforts to choose the therapy that is most likely to stabilize or reduce the burden of disease with the fewest side effects, and maintain that therapy until either unacceptable toxicities are evident or disease progression occurs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3583238095\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H46041291\"><span class=\"h2\">Types of ET</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several types of ETs. These can be characterized as strategies to deplete estrogen and strategies to directly target the estrogen receptor (ER).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Strategies to deplete estrogen</strong> &ndash; While initial therapies to deplete estrogen were accomplished in premenopausal women by oophorectomy, estrogen can now be suppressed with the use of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists and antagonists. Although ovarian estrogen production disappears with menopause, postmenopausal women continue to produce low levels of estrogen. This estrogen is derived from adrenal precursors, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">testosterone</a>, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) that are converted to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estradiol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estrone-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estrone</a> by aromatase activity in peripheral cells and even in the cancers themselves. </p><p/><p>Specific inhibitors of aromatase are available. Two of these, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anastrozole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">anastrozole</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=letrozole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">letrozole</a>, are azole compounds, while the third is a 17-hydroxy steroid. Prospective randomized clinical trials in both the adjuvant and metastatic setting have demonstrated that the clinical activity, side effects, and toxicity of these three aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are almost identical, and the choice of any one of them is appropriate. (See <a href=\"#H1346819087\" class=\"local\">'Aromatase inhibitors'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Strategies to directly target the estrogen receptor</strong> &ndash;<em> </em>There are two strategies to interfere with ER signaling: the use of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) or selective estrogen receptor down-regulators (SERDs).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tamoxifen</a> is a SERM with mixed ER antagonistic and agonistic properties. It is principally antagonistic in breast cancer and breast tissue, as well as brain, whereas it has agonistic effects in bone, liver, and uterus. (See <a href=\"#H2036150368\" class=\"local\">'Later-line therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><a href=\"topic.htm?path=raloxifene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Raloxifene</a> appears to be a weaker SERM, and it is only indicated in the prevention setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selective-estrogen-receptor-modulators-and-aromatase-inhibitors-for-breast-cancer-prevention#H31421397\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selective estrogen receptor modulators and aromatase inhibitors for breast cancer prevention&quot;, section on 'Raloxifene'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fulvestrant-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fulvestrant</a> is the only available agent that down-regulates ER. Fulvestrant is a highly insoluble compound with poor oral bioavailability and a short intravenous half-life, and therefore must be given intramuscularly. Fulvestrant is very dose dependent, with studies showing improved efficacy at 500 mg rather than 250 mg intramuscularly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-approach-to-metastatic-hormone-receptor-positive-her2-negative-breast-cancer-endocrine-therapy-and-targeted-agents/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3422359421\" class=\"local\">'Fulvestrant'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>While estrogen obviously has agonistic activity for ER, its use is generally restricted to the later-line setting. Androgens and progestins have been used in the past against ER-positive metastatic breast cancer; however, the mechanism of action of these agents has never been clear and because of their toxicities, and relatively lower efficacies compared with more modern ETs, they are rarely if ever used anymore. (See <a href=\"#H2036150368\" class=\"local\">'Later-line therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H815225970\"><span class=\"h2\">Rationale for inhibition of other targets (CDK and mTOR)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Over the last decade, several prospective randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that addition of agents that mechanistically work in different ways than through ER interference can enhance the benefit seen with ET alone. In particular, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) <span class=\"nowrap\">4/6</span> inhibitors in combination with ET are often used as a first-line therapy. Three separate agents, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palbociclib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">palbociclib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribociclib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribociclib</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abemaciclib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abemaciclib</a>, which inhibit CDK <span class=\"nowrap\">4/6,</span> improve progression-free survival (PFS) when added to ET as first-line or subsequent therapies. These trials have not yet demonstrated an overall survival (OS) benefit. However, the PFS benefit is impressive, and therefore, they have gained widespread use. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=everolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Everolimus</a>, an inhibitor of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), has also demonstrated improved PFS when added to ET in the endocrine-resistant setting. At this time, there are no randomized trials comparing the various CDK <span class=\"nowrap\">4/6</span> inhibitors, everolimus, or their combination in patients receiving ET. Because the side effect profile of the CDK <span class=\"nowrap\">4/6</span> inhibitors appears substantially more tolerable than that seen with everolimus, we prefer using CDK <span class=\"nowrap\">4/6</span> inhibitors rather than everolimus as the initial targeted therapy to partner with ET.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4168031543\"><span class=\"h2\">Resistance to treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of new metastatic lesions, clinical deterioration, or growth of lesions suggests a given treatment is not working. Appropriate monitoring, duration of treatment, and definition of failure is discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic treatment for metastatic breast cancer: General principles&quot;, section on 'Monitoring therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles#H453568818\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic treatment for metastatic breast cancer: General principles&quot;, section on 'Duration of treatment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles#H105835326\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic treatment for metastatic breast cancer: General principles&quot;, section on 'Definition of treatment failure'</a>.) </p><p>When patients fail to respond or stop responding to a given line of ET or a targeted agent, an important consideration is whether or not to proceed with another line of ET (with or without a targeted agent) or move to chemotherapy. The relative level of ER in the tissue (2 to 9 versus &ge;10 percent), the duration of response to the prior ET or targeted therapy, the patient's tolerance of prior therapy, and the presence or absence of rapidly progressive visceral disease should all factor into the decision regarding whether to proceed with another line of <span class=\"nowrap\">ET/targeted</span> therapy or move to chemotherapy. We often offer patients two to three lines of ET (including targeted agents) before moving to chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-treatment-of-metastatic-breast-cancer-in-women-chemotherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic treatment of metastatic breast cancer in women: Chemotherapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Many possible reasons exist for resistance to ET. For example:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Studies have suggested that up to 30 percent of metastatic ER-positive breast cancers may have activating mutations in the estrogen-binding domain of the gene that encodes for ER (<em>ESR1</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-approach-to-metastatic-hormone-receptor-positive-her2-negative-breast-cancer-endocrine-therapy-and-targeted-agents/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. In this case, these cancers may be resistant to estrogen depletion (eg, AIs), but they may better respond to ER-targeting therapies, perhaps requiring higher doses of SERM or SERD than needed for wild-type cancers. Clinical trials are being conducted to test this hypothesis, but given limited available data and lack of validated assays, we do not routinely test for or use <em>ESR1</em> mutational status to direct care for those not enrolled in a clinical trial. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some data have suggested that altered <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> metabolism may affect its activity. However, we do not test for germline <em>CYP2D6 </em>status or use it to direct therapy for ER-positive patients with metastatic disease.

This is because up to 15 percent of metastatic cancers may have discordant ER measurement compared with the primary cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-approach-to-metastatic-hormone-receptor-positive-her2-negative-breast-cancer-endocrine-therapy-and-targeted-agents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

For patients with 2 to 9 percent staining, ET should be considered but may be less likely to be effective. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hormone-receptors-in-breast-cancer-clinical-utility-and-guideline-recommendations-to-improve-test-accuracy#H12694235\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hormone receptors in breast cancer: Clinical utility and guideline recommendations to improve test accuracy&quot;, section on 'Interpretation of ER and PR tests'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Approximately 20 percent of hormone receptor-positive breast cancers are also HER2 positive. These patients should receive HER2-directed therapy as part of their treatment regimen.

Several studies have suggested that addition of targeted therapies to ET improves progression-free survival (PFS), although overall survival (OS) results are still pending. These agents include the inhibitor of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=everolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">everolimus</a>, as well as inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) <span class=\"nowrap\">4/6</span> (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=palbociclib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">palbociclib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribociclib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribociclib</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abemaciclib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abemaciclib</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Women who progress &ge;12 months from the end of adjuvant ET and patients who present with de novo metastatic breast cancer are eligible for first-line ET or ET in combination with a CDK <span class=\"nowrap\">4/6</span> inhibitor.

We take this approach in order to maximize the chances of an early, meaningful, and more rapid response than one might anticipate from ET alone or in combination with targeted agents. Other than in this rare circumstance, trials have not shown any benefit for using chemotherapy prior to ET [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-approach-to-metastatic-hormone-receptor-positive-her2-negative-breast-cancer-endocrine-therapy-and-targeted-agents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on &quot;patient info&quot; and the keyword(s) of interest.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beyond the Basics topics (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-metastatic-breast-cancer-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Treatment of metastatic breast cancer (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H264716193\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although metastatic breast cancer is unlikely to be cured, there have been meaningful improvements in survival due to the availability of more effective systemic therapies, including endocrine therapy (ET) in the treatment of hormone-sensitive disease. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given that up to 15 percent of metastatic cancers may have discordant estrogen receptor (ER) measurement compared with the primary cancer, we biopsy a metastatic lesion in patients with new metastatic disease to confirm ER, progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status. (See <a href=\"#H3583238095\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since ET (alone or in combination with targeted agents) is generally less toxic than chemotherapy, it is preferable for most patients with hormone receptor-positive disease to begin treatment with ET, with or without a targeted agent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, for patients with rapidly progressive or extensive visceral metastasis with end-organ dysfunction, we suggest chemotherapy rather than ET as their first-line treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Patients who demonstrate a good clinical response to chemotherapy may become candidates for discontinuation of chemotherapy and initiation of ET. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic treatment for metastatic breast cancer: General principles&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients <strong>without</strong> rapidly progressive or extensive visceral metastases are appropriate candidates for ET.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For such patients who are <strong>premenopausal, </strong>we suggest ovarian suppression or ablation <span class=\"nowrap\">(OS/OA)</span> in combination with ET and a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) <span class=\"nowrap\">4/6</span> inhibitor rather than <span class=\"nowrap\">OS/OA</span> and ET alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). However, <span class=\"nowrap\">OS/OA</span> with ET without a CDK <span class=\"nowrap\">4/6</span> inhibitor is acceptable for those who prefer to avoid the added toxicity of a CDK <span class=\"nowrap\">4/6</span> inhibitor. Single-agent treatment with a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) alone is an acceptable alternative for those who wish to avoid combined-modality treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>If a patient progresses on a regimen including ovarian suppression, serum <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estradiol</a> levels should be checked to ensure menopausal status was achieved, and if not, ablation should be pursued. Once menopause is achieved (by ablation or by suppression, with confirmation by laboratory testing), the treatment approach for postmenopausal women is used. (See <a href=\"#H1248533207\" class=\"local\">'ET for postmenopausal women'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For such patients who are <strong>postmenopausal, </strong>our preference for first-line ET is a CDK <span class=\"nowrap\">4/6</span> inhibitor in combination with an aromatase inhibitor (AI). Other options include single-agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fulvestrant-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fulvestrant</a> or an AI. (See <a href=\"#H146248622\" class=\"local\">'First-line therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H882605031\" class=\"local\">'Alternatives'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While there is no optimal sequence for sequencing ET at progression, a choice between options depends on the patient&rsquo;s previous treatment history and tolerance of treatment. The combinations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fulvestrant-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fulvestrant</a> plus a CDK <span class=\"nowrap\">4/6</span> inhibitor or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=everolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">everolimus</a> plus either an AI or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> are reserved for patients who have progressed on at least one line of ET. (See <a href=\"#H2631268003\" class=\"local\">'Subsequent-line options'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have progressed on two or more lines of ET, a switch to chemotherapy may be appropriate. However, for patients who are asymptomatic with slowly progressive disease, continuation of ET is reasonable, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> may be an appropriate later-line option. (See <a href=\"#H2036150368\" class=\"local\">'Later-line therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2920272300\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The authors and editors would like to recognize Drs.
