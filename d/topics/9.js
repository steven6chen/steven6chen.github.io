However, in the premarketing phase of drug development, multiple reports emerged of a hypersensitivity syndrome associated with abacavir, which led to significant morbidity. Rare reports of mortality were associated with failure to recognize this clinical syndrome as drug hypersensitivity.</p><p>Research into this syndrome has demonstrated a host predisposition to this drug-associated hypersensitivity reaction, which is based on immunogenetics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abacavir-hypersensitivity-reaction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Subsequent studies have demonstrated improved drug safety when <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a> use is restricted to patients without this genetic predisposition. This is the first time that an immunogenetic marker has been used in clinical practice to prevent a specific drug toxicity.</p><p>This topic will address the epidemiology, immunogenetics, clinical manifestations, clinical management, and screening recommendations for the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a> hypersensitivity reaction (AHR). Indications for use of abacavir as part of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selecting-antiretroviral-regimens-for-the-treatment-naive-hiv-infected-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selecting antiretroviral regimens for the treatment-na&iuml;ve HIV-infected patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL BACKGROUND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &quot;human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system&quot; is synonymous with the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC). These terms describe a group of genes on chromosome 6 that encode a variety of cell surface markers, antigen-presenting molecules, and other proteins involved in immune function. The HLA region is divided into three classes and there are three different class I antigens (HLA-A, -B, -C). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-leukocyte-antigens-hla-a-roadmap\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human leukocyte antigens (HLA): A roadmap&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The principal task of the immune system is to recognize and respond to potential pathogens without reacting to the normal components of the individual. Class I HLA molecules present peptide fragments of foreign antigens to CD8+ T cells, which generally have <span class=\"nowrap\">cytotoxic/suppressor</span> function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-histocompatibility-complex-mhc-structure-and-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) structure and function&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMUNOGENETIC BASIS FOR AHR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) associations with certain rheumatic diseases have been known for several decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abacavir-hypersensitivity-reaction/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, interest in HLA background as a potential risk factor for certain drug reactions has only become well defined over the past few years. Associations have been drawn between severe hypersensitivity reactions to particular drugs and specific class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) backgrounds. These include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a> (HLA-B*58:01), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a> (HLA-B*15:02), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a> (HLA-B*57:01) and flucloxacillin (HLA-B*57:01) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abacavir-hypersensitivity-reaction/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>A strong body of evidence from both basic science and clinical research has demonstrated that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a> hypersensitivity is exclusively restricted by the HLA allele HLA-B*57:01 and is mediated by the activation of CD8+ T-lymphocytes that then release inflammatory cytokines and result in the clinical syndrome of abacavir hypersensitivity reaction (AHR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abacavir-hypersensitivity-reaction/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. The precise mechanism for this has been revealed by biochemical and structural studies showing that abacavir binds non-covalently to the floor of the peptide-binding groove of HLA-B*57:01 with exquisite specificity to alter the self-peptides that are presented to the immune system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F86765\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86765 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abacavir-hypersensitivity-reaction/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. This specificity explains the 100 percent negative predictive value of HLA-B*57:01 testing for hypersensitivity, which underpins its utility as a screening test. The rapid and direct non-covalent binding of abacavir to HLA-B*57:01 without the requirement for metabolism of the drug also explains the clinical symptoms of hypersensitivity, including dose-related escalation of symptoms and rapid offset of symptoms following drug cessation.</p><p>Ex vivo data strongly support a role for cytotoxic T cells in the pathogenesis of AHR:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The production of interferon-gamma was specifically induced by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a> exposure in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from hypersensitive patients carrying the HLA-B*57:01 allele compared with tolerant controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abacavir-hypersensitivity-reaction/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a history of AHR had increased levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) in response to ex vivo <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a> stimulation; these responses were abrogated by CD8+ T-cell depletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abacavir-hypersensitivity-reaction/abstract/5,6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Significant CD8 T-cell proliferation in response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a> stimulation occurred in patients with a positive abacavir skin patch test compared with stimulation with control antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abacavir-hypersensitivity-reaction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Furthermore, skin biopsies from both the skin rash of AHR and a positive patch test following AHR have demonstrated abundant CD8+ T cells. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Skin patch testing'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>In addition to its role in AHR, HLA-B*57:01 has been shown to play an important role in HIV control, viral set point, and has been overrepresented in populations of long-term nonprogressors and elite controllers. HLA-B*57:01 is associated with early, broad, and strong HIV-specific T-cell responses, particularly to epitopes in the gag protein. The virus cannot mutate to escape these responses without incurring a large loss of replicative capacity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abacavir-hypersensitivity-reaction/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Patients were identified through chart review and were classified as having AHR either through clinical suspicion alone (defined as having at least two symptoms or signs consistent with AHR) or based on clinical findings supplemented with a positive skin patch test.

(See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>AHR typically presents with a combination of symptoms, including fever (which is almost always present), constitutional symptoms (eg, malaise, dizziness, and headache), and gastrointestinal disturbances (eg, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abacavir-hypersensitivity-reaction/abstract/15,26-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,26-37</a>]. In one retrospective study, respiratory symptoms (eg, dyspnea, cough) occurred in approximately one-third of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abacavir-hypersensitivity-reaction/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The median time to onset of symptoms in patch test-confirmed cases is seven to eight days, although symptoms have been reported within one to two days of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a> initiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abacavir-hypersensitivity-reaction/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>].

Since it remains theoretically possible that a second rare HLA allele may also mediate AHR, HLA-B*57:01 should NOT be used as a diagnostic test for AHR after the drug has been started. Thus, a negative HLA-B*57:01 result should not be used to eliminate the diagnosis of AHR in previously exposed patients who developed a compatible clinical syndrome; such an approach has not been studied and carries the potential risk of morbidity and mortality with rechallenge in a patient with a rare predisposing HLA allele.</p><p>Similarly, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a> patch testing has less than 100 percent diagnostic sensitivity and a negative patch test should not be used as the basis for abacavir rechallenge.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">AVAILABLE TESTING METHODS FOR AHR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Screening for HLA-B*57:01 represents a major advance in the care of HIV-infected patients and remains the mainstay in preventing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a> hypersensitivity reaction (AHR) and its associated morbidity and mortality.</p><p>Ideally, all patients should be screened for HLA-B*57:01 prior to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a> therapy. However, if testing is not available, abacavir can be initiated in conjunction with a clinical management program. Abacavir should be promptly discontinued in any patient who develops multiple symptoms and signs compatible with AHR whether or not genetic screening has been done.</p><p>Rechallenge with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a> in patients who have a documented clinical syndrome compatible with AHR is not recommended. In contrast, patients who have been &quot;labeled&quot; with a diagnosis of AHR, but whose clinical syndrome was clearly not compatible with AHR (eg, single symptom disease, such as isolated skin rash) can have abacavir reintroduced, if their HLA-B*57:01 screening test is negative.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Sensitivity and specificity of HLA-B*57:01 screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial doubt was cast on the generalizability of HLA-B*57:01 testing since further studies showed particularly low sensitivities of HLA-B*57:01 for clinically diagnosed <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a> hypersensitivity in black patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abacavir-hypersensitivity-reaction/abstract/20,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,25</a>]. However, it became apparent that false-positive clinical diagnoses were responsible for this discrepancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abacavir-hypersensitivity-reaction/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This was further supported by the consistent 2 to 7 percent rates of clinically diagnosed abacavir hypersensitivity reaction in the non-abacavir arm of randomized double blinded placebo-controlled studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abacavir-hypersensitivity-reaction/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>A retrospective, case-control study (SHAPE) in a racially diverse population showed 100 percent sensitivity of HLA-B*57:01 for skin patch-confirmed AHR, suggesting a 100 percent negative predictive value of HLA-B*57:01 testing for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a> hypersensitivity in patients of both white and black race [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abacavir-hypersensitivity-reaction/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Experience to date suggests that only those genetically susceptible patients who are &quot;immunologically primed&quot; by prior ingestion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a> exposure will develop a positive patch test. Thus, skin patch testing can only be reliably performed to characterize patients with a history of possible AHR, and patch testing is not helpful for predicting risk of AHR in unexposed patients.</p><p>Skin patch testing has also helped to reinforce the strong association between HLA-B*57:01 and AHR. For example, of 95 patients with clinically suspected <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a> hypersensitivity and positive patch tests described in three studies, 100 percent have carried HLA-B*57:01 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abacavir-hypersensitivity-reaction/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>However, a negative <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a> patch test result can neither rule out AHR nor be used to justify rechallenge with abacavir [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abacavir-hypersensitivity-reaction/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In the PREDICT-1 study, the diagnostic sensitivity of abacavir skin patch testing was calculated to be 87 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abacavir-hypersensitivity-reaction/abstract/27,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,31</a>]. A negative patch test in the setting of clinically suspected AHR may be due to a false-positive clinical diagnosis or, less commonly, a false negative skin patch test result. Patients with a past history clinically compatible with AHR should be evaluated and treated as described above.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A strong body of evidence from both basic science and clinical research has demonstrated that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a> hypersensitivity is associated with HLA-B*57:01 background and is mediated via CD8+ T-lymphocytes. No HLA allele other than HLA-B*57:01 has been associated with immunologically-confirmed abacavir hypersensitivity to date; the mechanistic basis for this exclusivity is based on the specificity of abacavir binding to the HLA-B*57:01 molecule. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Immunogenetic basis for AHR'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the pre-screening era, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a> hypersensitivity reaction (AHR) was diagnosed in 4 to 8 percent of treated patients. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology of AHR'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AHR typically presents with a combination of symptoms, including fever, rash, gastrointestinal disturbances, and other constitutional symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Clinical syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Abacavir</a> should be discontinued in a patient with signs and symptoms of AHR that progress without another explanation. Once the patient has improved, rechallenge with abacavir, or any formulation containing abacavir (eg, Epzicom) in a patient with suspected AHR is absolutely contraindicated. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Clinical management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin patch testing helps to define those patients with a history of possible AHR with true immunogenetically-mediated disease versus a false-positive clinical diagnosis. Although useful as a research tool in clinical trials, skin patch testing should not be used as the basis for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a> rechallenge. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who are being considered for therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a>, we recommend HLA-B*57:01 screening to decrease the risk of AHR (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). This is consistent with recommendations from guideline committees. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Screening prior to abacavir exposure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although genetic screening for HLA-B*57:01 improves the safety of prescribing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a>, appropriate counseling of patients of potential signs and symptoms is still indicated, even if their screening test is negative. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring of patients on abacavir'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abacavir-hypersensitivity-reaction/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Martin MA, Klein TE, Dong BJ, et al.
