It may be particularly useful in evaluating the patient with variable blood pressure readings in the office or in the patient with wide discrepancies between the blood pressure readings at home and at the clinician's office (ie, &quot;white coat&quot; hypertension). ABPM and, in particular, nocturnal blood pressure readings may also provide prognostic data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>This topic provides an overview of ABPM, white coat hypertension, indications for ABPM, and the utility of ABPM in clinical practice.

However, mostly due to issues of cost and inconvenience, other groups do not recommend ABPM for the evaluation of patients with uncomplicated hypertension or to screen for hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>There are a number of other potential indications advocated by some experts, which include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To establish nondipper status or nocturnal hypertension</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To assess large variations in self-measured blood pressure values</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To evaluate whether antihypertensive therapy is moderating the early morning blood pressure surge</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To assess elevated office blood pressure in pregnant women, with preeclampsia suspected</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MEASUREMENT OF ABPM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ABPM is determined using a device worn by the patient that takes blood pressure measurements over a 24- to 48-hour period, usually every 15 to 20 minutes during the daytime and every 30 to 60 minutes during sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These blood pressures are recorded on the device, and the average day (diurnal) or night (nocturnal) blood pressures are determined from the data by a computer. The percentage of blood pressure readings exceeding the upper limit of normal can also be calculated.</p><p>However, ABPM is not available in most clinicians' offices. This is due to a combination of factors, including lack of knowledge regarding its utility, its expense, and minimal reimbursement by third-party payers. In addition, ABPM is still only a one-time measure of a variable factor that must be followed over time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INTERPRETATION OF ABPM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unique data provided by ABPM include 24-hour average blood pressure, daytime (awake) blood pressure, nighttime (asleep) blood pressure, systolic blood pressure load, diastolic blood pressure load, and nocturnal dipping of the blood pressure. The prognostic value of 24-hour blood pressure and dipping is discussed in more detail below. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Prognostic value of ABPM'</a> below.)</p><p>One of the unresolved issues in ABPM is the definition of what constitutes normal and elevated blood pressure. A meta-analysis of normotensive subjects found mean 24-hour and daytime values to be <span class=\"nowrap\">118/72</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">123/76</span> mmHg, respectively; the former is lower since the blood pressure normally falls with sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Most experts agree that 24-hour blood pressure <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;115/75</span> mmHg is probably normal, and <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;125/75</span> mmHg is probably abnormal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/1,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Definition of hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The definition of hypertension based upon data obtained from ABPM is discussed elsewhere.

Failure of the blood pressure to fall by at least 10 percent during sleep is called nondipping. The underlying mechanisms of nondipping are unknown, but intrinsic renal defects may contribute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. There is also some evidence suggesting that melatonin plays a role.

However, the difference in prognostic accuracy between ABPM and office readings might be diminished by obtaining repeated blood pressure measurements during the same visit or by measuring blood pressure in a standardized fashion with appropriate equipment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>].</p><p>This more accurate assessment of cardiovascular risks with 24-hour monitoring was illustrated in the following studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/16,17,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17,24</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective study of 1963 treated hypertensive patients, an increased risk for a new cardiovascular event was observed in patients with a 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure of greater than 135 mmHg (relative risk 1.75, 95% CI 1.15-2.63 compared with less than 135 mmHg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In two separate community-based studies with 1700 and 5292 participants, multivariate analysis demonstrated that ambulatory blood pressures were more predictive than office blood pressures of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality after a mean follow-up of over eight years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p/><p>ABPM also has predictive value in patients with resistant hypertension. At an equivalent level of office blood pressure, patients with higher ambulatory values are at greater cardiovascular risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>].

In addition, night ambulatory blood pressure was a strong predictor of the composite outcome of death and ESRD. Another study of 436 patients with chronic kidney disease observed that, compared with office blood pressure, 24-hour average blood pressure more accurately predicted both progression to ESRD and cardiovascular events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Masked hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As many as 10 to 40 percent of patients in the general population who are normotensive by conventional clinic measurement are hypertensive by ABPM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-33</a>]. The proportion may be higher (30 to 70 percent) in patients with chronic kidney disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p>This phenomenon is called masked hypertension or isolated ambulatory hypertension. It has only been identified by screening clinical studies since patients who are normotensive by office readings do not typically undergo ambulatory monitoring.</p><p>Masked hypertension has been associated with an increased long-term risk of sustained hypertension and cardiovascular morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/32,33,36-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33,36-39</a>]. Because of the risk associated with masked hypertension, ABPM should be considered in patients referred for possible hypertension (for a variety of reasons, such as LVH) despite repeatedly normal blood pressure when measured in the clinic. Patients with masked hypertension who have alterations to their antihypertensive regimen should be followed with out-of-office blood pressure measurements.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Nocturnal blood pressure and nondippers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Considerable data suggest that measurement of nighttime blood pressure yields additional prognostic data in terms of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/17,24,40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,24,40,41</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A cohort study of 7458 patients in six countries from Europe, Asia, and South America found that both daytime and nighttime blood pressure predicted all cardiovascular events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Nighttime blood pressure, adjusted for daytime blood pressure, predicted total, cardiovascular, and noncardiovascular mortality.

However, &quot;extreme dipping&quot; (eg, &gt;20 percent nocturnal decline in blood pressure) and a large morning increase in blood pressure are also potentially deleterious [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/44,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,46</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1749548203\" class=\"local\">'Dipping'</a> above.)</p><p>Nondipping has also been associated with moderately increased albuminuria (formerly called &quot;microalbuminuria&quot;) and more rapid progression of nephropathy in patients with diabetes mellitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. More importantly, nondipping may be a risk factor for decline in glomerular filtration rate, as well as for ESRD and death among patients with chronic kidney disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/28,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,49</a>]. The presence of sleep apnea should also be evaluated in nondippers.

There are conflicting data about whether or not nocturnal dosing of antihypertensive medications can restore a dipping pattern. This issue is discussed in detail elsewhere.

The diagnosis of white coat hypertension (also called isolated clinic or office hypertension) is applied to patients with office readings that average more than <span class=\"nowrap\">130/80</span> mmHg and reliable out-of-office readings that average less than <span class=\"nowrap\">130/80</span> mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Having the blood pressure in the office taken by a nurse or technician, rather than the clinician, may minimize the white coat effect (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F73781\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73781 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In addition, automated oscillometric blood pressure monitors permit blood pressure measurement in the clinic without requiring that a nurse, medical assistant, or doctor be present in the room; these devices may greatly reduce the white coat effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>Sequential studies have shown that, in patients diagnosed as being hypertensive on a first visit to a new clinician, there is a mean 15 and 7 mmHg fall in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, by the third visit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>], with some patients not reaching a stable value until the sixth visit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Thus, it has been recommended that a patient with mild to moderate elevation in blood pressure should not be diagnosed with hypertension unless the blood pressure remains elevated after three to six visits, <strong>unless</strong> there is evidence of ongoing end-organ damage.</p><p>In cross-sectional studies, the prevalence of white coat hypertension ranges from 10 to more than 20 percent, and it appears to be higher in children and older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/32,55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,55-57</a>]. White coat hypertension can also be seen in patients with apparently resistant hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. The likelihood of normal ambulatory blood pressures is low (less than 5 percent) in patients with office diastolic blood pressures &ge;105 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>], but such patients may still have a white coat effect that underestimates the efficacy of therapy.</p><p>A white coat hypertension effect may also occur in patients with apparently resistant hypertension. As an example, in one study of nearly 500 treated hypertensive patients (over 60 percent on three or more antihypertensive agents), 37 percent had normal blood pressure on ABPM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 6000 subjects followed for a median of 5.4 years after having ABPM, stroke rates were significantly higher in patients with sustained hypertension compared with those who had persistent normotension (0.65 versus 0.35 percent per year) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Stroke rates were also higher in those who had white coat hypertension (0.59 versus 0.35 percent per year), but this was not statistically significant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a population-based cohort of 2051 adults who underwent office, home, and ambulatory blood pressure measurements, those with white coat hypertension had a significantly higher rate of all-cause mortality during 16 years of follow-up, as compared with persistent normotension (19.7 versus 6.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. However, among individuals with office hypertension who had <strong>both</strong> normal ambulatory and home blood pressure, there was no significant association with mortality, suggesting that &quot;true&quot; white coat hypertension may require documentation of normal ambulatory blood pressure and normal home blood pressure.</p><p/><p>Patients with white coat hypertension are also at high risk for developing sustained hypertension. In a study of 81 patients with office hypertension (mean blood pressure <span class=\"nowrap\">154/97</span> mmHg) and normal 12-hour ambulatory blood pressure (mean blood pressure <span class=\"nowrap\">125/77</span> mmHg), 60 had a mean ambulatory blood pressure above <span class=\"nowrap\">140/90</span> mmHg after five to six years of follow-up (74 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>In summary, the optimal approach to patients with white coat hypertension is uncertain. If therapy is withheld because of a normal home or ambulatory blood pressure, careful monitoring is still indicated for the possible development of worsening hypertension or of end-organ damage, while the patient is encouraged to modify unhealthy lifestyle habits.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">INFLUENCE ON THERAPY OF HYPERTENSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Therapeutic decisions can be made according to the ambulatory blood pressure findings. When used for the above appropriate indications, one report found that antihypertensive therapy was changed in nearly one-half of the patients, and office blood pressure control was improved in most patients within three months of ABPM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>Ambulatory or self-recorded home readings may detect the early morning blood pressure surge that may contribute to the increased incidence of sudden death, myocardial infarction, and stroke in the early morning hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/46,68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,68,69</a>]. Modulation of this early morning surge in blood pressure may not occur with supposedly long-acting, &quot;once-daily&quot; agents, which do not provide 24-hour coverage. Such drugs, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enalapril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enalapril</a>, may lose much of their effect during the early morning hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>], and they, therefore, may need to be taken twice per day. Preferably, long-acting medications with effects that truly last for 24 hours (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorthalidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorthalidone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amlodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amlodipine</a>) should be substituted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>].</p><p>Furthermore, in those with nocturnal hypertension or nondipping, ABPM may help to determine the best timing of administration of antihypertensive agents. In one study, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valsartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valsartan</a> taken before bedtime reestablished the nocturnal reduction in blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].</p><p>The effect of repeated ambulatory monitoring on the treatment of hypertension was assessed in a randomized trial from Belgium in which 419 patients with untreated diastolic hypertension (average &ge;95 mmHg) had their subsequent antihypertensive therapy determined by conventional office blood pressure or ABPM at one, two, four, and six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. The mean reduction in blood pressure in the two groups was the same at the end of the study, averaging approximately <span class=\"nowrap\">14/10</span> mmHg. The following significant benefits were noted with the use of ABPM:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fewer required multidrug therapy (27 versus 43 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More patients were able to stop antihypertensive drugs (26 versus 7 percent), suggesting a 19 percent incidence of white coat hypertension.</p><p/><p>Left ventricular mass at six months was not different between the two groups, suggesting that withdrawal of antihypertensive therapy was appropriate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">COST</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cost of ABPM is mainly the initial investment in purchasing the monitors and computer software. The average cost in 2011 for equipment was USD $2500 to $5000 for each monitor and $2000 to $3000 for the computer software. The monitors are relatively simple to use, and additional costs in training personnel are relatively small. Clinician charges to patients for the use of this modality ranged widely. At this time, Medicaid and Medicare in the United States provide limited payment for ambulatory monitoring but only for the evaluation of possible white coat hypertension.</p><p>However, the money saved by not prescribing antihypertensive medications to patients with white coat hypertension may more than offset the cost of monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,77</a>]. Home, self-recorded measurements with inexpensive semiautomatic devices will provide most of the information (other than for nocturnal readings) at far less cost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>], but they require more time and care to obtain the information provided in one day by ABPM.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">HOME BLOOD PRESSURE MEASUREMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In view of the cost and limited availability of ABPM, increasing attention is being given to home monitoring with inexpensive (USD $40 to $60) semiautomatic devices. Such self-recorded, casual blood pressure measurements taken at home or work correlate more closely with the results of 24-hour or daytime ABPM than with the blood pressure taken in the clinician's office [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/1,13,79,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13,79,80</a>]. Furthermore, home blood pressure measurements may be more predictive of adverse outcomes (eg, stroke, end-stage renal disease [ESRD]) than clinic blood pressures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/28,81,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,81,82</a>].

A 2013 meta-analysis of 52 trials that randomly allocated patients to home blood pressure monitoring or standard clinic-based monitoring found the following significant benefits associated with home-based monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A greater decrease in blood pressure by 3.<span class=\"nowrap\">9/2</span>.4 mmHg at six months when blood pressure self-monitoring was compared with usual care</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A greater decrease in blood pressure by as much as 8.<span class=\"nowrap\">3/4</span>.4 mmHg at 12 months when self-monitoring combined with additional supportive interventions was compared with usual care</p><p/><p>However, the efficacy of home blood pressure self-monitoring on blood pressure reduction and control is less clear in patients with socioeconomic health barriers. For example, in a trial of 900 patients, most of whom were black and Hispanic, in an urban setting, provision of a home blood pressure monitor along with training on its use had no effect on systolic blood pressure reduction (which fell by 15 compared with 14 mmHg in the control group) or the proportion of patients achieving goal blood pressure (39 percent in both groups) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. Thus, additional interventions, such as nurse-led disease management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>], may be required in combination with home blood pressure monitoring to achieve better blood pressure control in some populations who have socioeconomic barriers to health care.</p><p>If the blood pressure is taken at home to establish the diagnosis of hypertension or to assess blood pressure control, the optimal schedule is unclear. Increasing evidence suggests that at least 12 to 14 measurements should be obtained, with both morning and evening measurements taken over one week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/1,12-14,94-98\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12-14,94-98</a>]. Thereafter, frequency of home blood pressure monitoring depends upon the stability of the blood pressure and whether the regimen is changed. An acceptable prescription for assessment of home blood pressure is one similar to that suggested by the American Heart Association (AHA), the European Society of Hypertension (ESH), and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/1,99\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,99</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While seated, the patient should take two measurements (separated by one to two minutes) in the morning and in the evening (ie, four measurements per day) for at least three, and preferably seven, consecutive days. These measurements should be recorded.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measurements from the first day should be discarded; the home blood pressure is defined as the average of all remaining measurements.</p><p/><p>In stable hypertensive patients with controlled blood pressure, this same procedure of 12 to 14 measurements taken over one week should be repeated approximately every three months to determine whether the blood pressure remains controlled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>In addition to improved control of the blood pressure, potential advantages of home blood pressure monitoring include identification of white coat hypertension, assessment of the response to antihypertensive medications, and improvement in patient compliance. A possible problem with home blood pressure monitoring is that self-reported blood pressure values may be erroneous compared with the actual measurements concurrently stored in memory-equipped, blood pressure-measuring devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>].</p><p>The potential problems with outpatient blood pressure measurements can be minimized by providing adequate training and by periodically checking the machine for accuracy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/1,101,102\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,101,102</a>]. Accuracy can be tested by having the patient or spouse take the blood pressure in the office with their home monitor at the same time that the clinician or health professional measures the blood pressure in the other arm.</p><p>As with ambulatory monitoring, the blood pressure taken by the patient varies widely during the day, being influenced by factors such as stress (particularly at work), smoking, caffeine intake, natural circadian variation, and exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. Thus, multiple readings are required to determine the average level.</p><p>The timing of antihypertensive medications must also be considered. With short-acting drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=captopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">captopril</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a>), the blood pressure may fall to normal or even below normal one to two hours after therapy and then gradually increase to elevated levels until the next dose is taken. This problem can be minimized by having the outpatient blood pressure measured 30 to 60 minutes before taking medications, preferably in the early morning to assess for possible inadequate overnight blood pressure control.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3044384793\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
