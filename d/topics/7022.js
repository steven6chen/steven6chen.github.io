As is the case for many geriatric syndromes, falls usually occur when impairments in multiple domains compromise the compensatory ability of the individual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Falls often go without clinical attention for a variety of reasons: the patient never mentions the event to a healthcare provider; there is no injury at the time of the fall; the provider fails to ask the patient about a history of falls; or either provider or patient erroneously believes that falls are an inevitable part of the aging process. Often, treatment of injuries resulting from a fall does not include investigation of the cause of the fall.</p><p>Significant morbidity and mortality may result from falls in older individuals, and falls are the leading cause of injury, both fatal and nonfatal, among older adults in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The importance of preventing falls is emphasized by a study that found that 80 percent of older women preferred death to a &quot;bad&quot; hip fracture that would result in nursing home admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>A number of the physical conditions and environmental situations that predispose to falls are modifiable. Clinicians caring for older patients need to routinely inquire about falls, assess for fall risk, and address modifiable underlying risk factors.</p><p>This topic focuses on risk factors and patient evaluation for falls. Measures to prevent falls in older persons are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Falls: Prevention in community-dwelling older persons&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of falls increases with age and varies according to living status. Between 30 and 40 percent of community-dwelling people over the age of 65 years fall each year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/2,4-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4-9</a>], increasing to about 50 percent for those 80 years and older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. In US data from 2014, there were an estimated 29 million falls, with higher rates of falls among those with poor health. Falls and fall injuries were reported more commonly by women than by men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Approximately 50 percent of individuals in the long-term care setting fall yearly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Almost 60 percent of those with a history of a fall in the previous year will have a subsequent fall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Falls often result in an injury of some type, usually minor soft tissue injuries such as bruises and scrapes. In one study of women over age 70 followed for two years, 41 percent of falls resulted in minor, and 6 percent in major, injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Earlier studies had also found that 5 to 10 percent of falls among community-dwelling older adults result in major injuries: fracture, head trauma, or major lacerations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/9,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13</a>]. Rates of fall-related major injuries for nursing home residents are higher (10 to 30 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Falls accounted for 62 percent of non-fatal injuries leading to US emergency department visits for people over 65 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Approximately 5 percent of falls in older persons will lead to hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The number of fall-related hospitalizations is likely to increase substantially with ongoing aging of the population. In the Netherlands, the number of hospitalizations for falls more than doubled between 1981 and 2008, although the average length of stay decreased and offset the total number of fall-related hospital days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Morbidity and mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fall-related injuries are associated with significant subsequent morbidity: decline in functional status, increased likelihood of nursing home placement, and greater use of medical services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. Compared with hospitalization due to other conditions, hospitalizations from falls resulting in hip fracture or other injuries lead to worse outcomes and a greater chance of nursing home admissions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Nearly 95 percent of hip fractures are caused by falls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Among community-living older adults who sustain hip fractures, 25 to 75 percent do not recover pre-injury functional status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In an Australian study, 9.5 percent of patients hospitalized for falls became first-time residents of a long-term care facility at discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In a 14-year prospective study of community-dwelling adults over age 70, recovery following a serious fall (requiring hospitalization) was related to prehospitalization functional status and trajectory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Rapid recovery was seen only in patients who had no or only mild disability prior to falling, and substantial recovery was unlikely for individuals with progressive or severe disability prior to the fall.</p><p>A sample of 1100 independent-living individuals over the age of 71 were followed prospectively for three years to evaluate the incidence and impact of falls. The following results were reported:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those who had suffered at least one fall experienced a decline in basic and instrumental activities of daily living [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Activity restriction was reported in 24 percent of recent fallers versus 15 percent of non-fallers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A total of 133 participants (12 percent) had long-term admissions to nursing homes. After adjustment for other risk factors, the risk of nursing home admission increased progressively for subjects with a single non-injurious fall, two or more non-injurious falls, or at least one fall causing serious injury (relative risk [RR] 3.1, 5.5, and 10.2, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p>Only one-half of older individuals who fall are able to get up without help, resulting in the so-called &quot;long lie.&quot; Fallers who are unable to get up are more likely to suffer lasting declines in activities of daily living than those who are able to get up (35 versus 26 percent in one series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Death after a fall occurs far less frequently than injuries. However, complications resulting from falls are the leading cause of death from injury in men and women older than age 65 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], and the fifth leading cause of death in older adults. In a large study of older adults seeking emergency care after a fall, 2.2 percent of injurious falls resulted in death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The death rate attributable to falls increases with age. A report from the National Trauma Data Bank noted that mortality was three times higher for seniors sustaining ground level falls, compared with younger individuals with falls, and that seniors were more likely to sustain long bone and pelvic fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The rate of fatal falls in people aged 65 years and older increased in the United States between 1993 and 2003 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Fatality rates are highest in white men (48.3 per 100,000 population).</p><p>The estimated cost of fall-related injuries for individuals older than age 65 in the United States in 2015 was USD $50 billion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. This figure can be expected to increase with an expanding geriatric population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Fear of falling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fear of falling, also called the post-fall anxiety syndrome, is a well-recognized syndrome in older persons. In a study of over 1000 community-dwelling women aged 70 to 85 years, fear of falling, as determined by questionnaire, was found in one-third of women at baseline, and affected 46 percent of the sample at three year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In another study of 673 community-dwelling older adults, 60 percent reported moderate activity restriction and 15 percent severe activity restriction due to fear of falling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. A systematic review found that fear of falling may affect 50 percent or more of patients following hip fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Fear of falling was associated with living alone, cognitive impairment, depression, and balance and mobility impairments, as well as a history of falls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/22,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,33</a>]. Fear of falling following hip fracture was associated with increased risk for institutionalization and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. New-onset fear of falling was predicted by obesity and impaired mobility.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Falls in older individuals are most often due to multiple causes, when a threat to the normal homeostatic mechanisms that maintain postural stability is superimposed on underlying age-related declines in balance, gait stability, and cardiovascular function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This threat may involve an acute illness (eg, fever, dehydration, arrhythmia), a new medication, an environmental stress (eg, unfamiliar surrounding), or an unsafe walking surface. The older person is unable to compensate for the additional stress (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F63126\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63126 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. </p><p>Clinicians commonly refer to some falls as &ldquo;mechanical falls.&rdquo; However, studies of risk factors for falls do not use this term because it is ill-defined and carries no special significance. In addition, dismissing a fall as &ldquo;mechanical&rdquo; may impede the appropriate assessment for risk factors because the fall is attributed to factors that are not modifiable.</p><p>The impact of challenges to postural control varies according to the risk-taking behavior of an individual and his or her opportunity to fall. Thus, individuals who are completely immobile may not be at risk of falling despite multiple predisposing factors, and those who are either vigorous or somewhat frail may be at increased risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Vigorous older individuals may take more risks, while the frail older persons may not be able to compensate for relatively minor threats to postural stability.</p><p>Multiple community-based prospective cohort studies of risk factors for falls have been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/6,10,37-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10,37-47</a>]. Risk factors that were found in at least two of the studies include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Past history of a fall</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower-extremity weakness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Female gender</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognitive impairment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Balance problems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychotropic drug use</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arthritis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of stroke</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Orthostatic hypotension</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dizziness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anemia</p><p/><p>Factors associated with increased risk for falls with major injuries (fracture, dislocation, or laceration requiring suture) include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fall associated with syncope</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of previous fall with injury</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased executive function, measured by Trail Making B time</p><p/><p>Studies differed significantly in the types of risk factors evaluated, the populations studied (eg, past fall history was sometimes an entry criterion), and the defined outcomes (one fall, two or more falls, injurious falls). Since recurrent falls may have worse outcomes, studies that consider all the falls (fall rate) as an outcome may be more informative than studies that consider time-to-first fall. In one systematic review of 18 longitudinal cohort studies, age itself was found to be an independent risk factor in only 4 of the 11 studies that considered age in a multivariate analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The fact that different risk factors were found across studies highlights the multifactorial nature of falls. Gait and balance impairment was the most consistent risk factor, followed by medications, in this systematic review that evaluated six potential risk factor domains: <span class=\"nowrap\">gait/balance,</span> medications, orthostatic hypotension, visual impairment, limitations in activities of daily living (ADL), and cognitive impairment.</p><p>The site of falling, whether indoors or outdoors, may also be a factor in identifying risk factors. Studies have suggested that indoor falls tend to occur in frail persons, while outdoor falls tend to occur in younger active persons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/48-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-51</a>]. This was corroborated in a prospective study of falls in a population-based sample of community-dwelling seniors in the Boston area that used fall calendars and individual follow-up of fallers to ascertain the location of falls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Indoor falls were associated with disability, indicators of poor health, and an inactive lifestyle, while outdoor falls were associated with an active lifestyle and average or better-than-average health. Although most studies of risk factors have not considered fall location, failure to do so may obscure important risk factors. As an example, if slow gait increases risk for indoor falls and decreases risk for outdoor falls, an analysis that combines indoor and outdoor falls may find no association for gait speed with falls. Additionally, if risk factors are dependent on the site of falling, specific intervention strategies to prevent falls may differ for indoor and outdoor falls.</p><p>Although some falls occur in individuals with no risk factors, the risk of falling generally increases with the number of risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/6,10,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10,38</a>]. The rate of falls is increased in recently hospitalized patients with other risk factors for falls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Postural control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical approach to fall prevention in older persons requires knowledge of age-related changes that affect postural control and increase the risk of falls. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Sensory systems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ability to maintain the upright posture is dependent upon sensory input from several systems, including proprioceptive and vestibular systems. Declines occur with aging:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proprioceptive sensitivity loss occurs in the lower extremities and leads to an increased risk of falling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The vestibular system is impaired by the loss of labyrinthine hair cells, vestibular ganglion cells, and nerve fibers.</p><p/><p>Loss of function in these sensory organs is compounded by age-related changes in the central nervous system, including loss of neurons and depletion of neurotransmitters (eg, dopamine) within the basal ganglia, causing further loss of postural control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>It is difficult to quantify the age-related changes in postural control that are independent of disease. Testing of postural stability (measured sway) in young and old subjects with no apparent musculoskeletal or neurologic impairment reveals age-related differences when moderately severe perturbations of stance are administered (changing the support surface, changing body position, altering the visual input, or moving the support surface horizontally or rotationally) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. These perturbations stress the redundancy of the sensory systems in their ability to maintain postural stability. Hearing loss has also been associated with an increased risk of falling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>], but whether this represents concomitant vestibular dysfunction or an independent risk is uncertain. Audiometrically defined hearing loss, compared with normal hearing, in older adults was associated with a 1.7 times greater odds of falling in a meta-analysis of six studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Muscle activation and composition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some of the most striking postural control differences between young and old relate to the order or grouping of muscle activation patterns.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older individuals tend to activate proximal muscles, such as the quadriceps, before more distal muscles, such as the tibialis anterior, in response to perturbations of the support surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

Among 481 participants in the Framingham Study who had sustained one fracture, 14.8 percent had a second hip fracture during a median four-year follow-up; risk increased with older age and higher functional status.

Multiple risk factors have been identified, including past history of a fall, lower-extremity weakness, age, female gender, cognitive impairment, balance problems, psychotropic drug use, arthritis, history of stroke, orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, and anemia.

The value of a complete neurological examination is uncertain. Diagnostic testing may include a complete blood count (CBC), serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine, glucose level, and vitamin D. Holter monitoring, echocardiograms, and radiologic studies are indicated only when suggested by findings on history of exam.
