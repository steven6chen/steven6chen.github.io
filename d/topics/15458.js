Factor V Leiden is the most common. The prothrombin gene mutation, deficiencies in protein S, protein C, and antithrombin account for most of the remaining cases, while rare causes include certain dysfibrinogenemias. The total prevalence of an inherited thrombophilia in patients with a deep vein thrombosis varies based upon patient selection and ethnicity; in Caucasian populations, it can be as high as 40 percent overall compared with about 10 percent in controls.

Reliable assays are now available to test for the presence of the various causes of inherited thrombophilia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F59759\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59759 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>However, unselected population-based screening for inherited thrombophilia is not recommended because of three salient factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The low frequency of the symptomatic condition in the general population (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F108016\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108016 \">table 2</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The low penetrance of the symptomatic condition among carriers of the most common thrombophilic conditions (eg, factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A mutations), <strong>AND</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lack of a safe, cost-effective, long-term method of prophylaxis if an abnormality is found.</p><p/><p>Patients with a family history of thrombosis are at increased risk for a mutation. However, a simple positive history is not a reliable criterion to select patients for screening. This was illustrated in a report of 101 patients who had their first and single thromboembolic event while using oral contraceptives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-inherited-thrombophilia-in-asymptomatic-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A family history of thrombosis in a first-degree relative had a positive predictive value of only 14 percent for factor V Leiden.</p><p>The usefulness of screening for hereditary thrombophilia has been considered in family members of patients with a history of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and a thrombophilic defect, especially antithrombin, protein S, or protein C deficiencies. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis of case-control and cohort studies showed that compared with controls, antithrombin-deficient individuals had an odds ratio (OR) of VTE of 16.3 (95% CI 9.9-26.7); this was substantially higher than the VTE risk attributed to protein S or protein C deficiency (ORs 5.4 and 7.5, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-inherited-thrombophilia-in-asymptomatic-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a report of 150 pedigrees with factor V Leiden or antithrombin, protein C, or protein S deficiency, the lifetime probability of developing thrombosis compared with those with no defect was 8.5 times higher for carriers of protein S deficiency, 8.1 for antithrombin deficiency, 7.3 for protein C deficiency, and 2.2 for carriers of factor V Leiden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-inherited-thrombophilia-in-asymptomatic-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective cohort study of 2479 relatives of individuals with thrombosis and a thrombophilic defect found that relatives who shared an inherited defect in protein S, protein C, or antithrombin had an annual risk of VTE of 1.5 to 1.9 percent and a cumulative VTE incidence of 55 percent at 10 years; individuals who shared other thrombophilic defects with the index case had lower cumulative risks (eg, 7 percent for factor V Leiden and 11 percent for prothrombin mutations) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-inherited-thrombophilia-in-asymptomatic-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective observational study of 206 pediatric patients &lt;18 years, found that 27 percent of first and second degree relatives had an inherited thrombophilia, the most common of which was heterozygosity for the factor V Leiden mutation (57 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-inherited-thrombophilia-in-asymptomatic-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Of these relatives with inherited thrombophilia, 23 percent (33 of 146) had VTE. In contrast, only 3.6 percent of relatives without an inherited defect had VTE. The risk of clinically important thrombophilia was greatest in individuals with protein S, protein C, and antithrombin mutations and least with factor V Leiden mutations.</p><p/><p>Since the genetic pattern for the inherited thrombophilias is autosomal dominant, one-half of the relatives of each patient with thrombosis and hereditary thrombophilia will carry the same defect. However, the value of screening for the presence of a defect remains controversial. The following sections provide arguments for and against such screening.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Arguments against screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Identification via screening of an inherited thrombophilia would theoretically permit the institution of prophylactic anticoagulation, either permanently or during high-risk situations. However, there are no data that justify the risks of long-term or permanent prophylactic anticoagulation in the asymptomatic individual (ie, an individual who has not had a thromboembolic event).</p><p>As examples, two studies of the incidence of thromboembolic disease in family members of patients with factor V Leiden suggest that neither of these strategies would be of value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-inherited-thrombophilia-in-asymptomatic-adults/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. In a retrospective, blinded analysis, the incidence of VTE was assessed in 437 first-degree relatives of 112 symptomatic heterozygotes and 30 relatives of six homozygotes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-inherited-thrombophilia-in-asymptomatic-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The annual incidence of thromboembolism in relatives of heterozygous patients was 0.45 percent in those with the mutation and 0.1 percent in those without the mutation; 20 percent of the episodes were related to surgery and 30 percent to pregnancy or the use of oral contraceptives.</p><p>The 0.35 percent difference between the two groups suggests that approximately 300 women would have to be treated (and suffer the risks and problems of anticoagulation) in an attempt to prevent one episode of VTE per year. This absolute benefit does not appear to justify life-long anticoagulation. It was also estimated that, if all identified pregnant carriers were treated with anticoagulant prophylaxis, treatment would be given unnecessarily in 98 percent of pregnant carriers who would be exposed to the risks of bleeding, bone loss, and thrombocytopenia. Similarly, if all potential users of oral contraceptives were screened and then discouraged from use of the drugs if they tested positive, 333 women would be identified for every episode of VTE prevented.</p><p>Similar arguments against screening for the prothrombin G20210A mutation have been presented, in which the annual incidence of thromboembolism in relatives of heterozygous patients was 0.37 percent in those with the mutation and 0.12 percent in those without the mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-inherited-thrombophilia-in-asymptomatic-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Arguments in favor of screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although prophylactic anticoagulation in the asymptomatic individual (ie, an individual who has not had a thromboembolic event) cannot be universally justified, there are high-risk situations (eg, major surgery, trauma, immobilization for &gt;7 days, pregnancy and puerperium) that may prompt consideration of prophylactic treatment in relatives who are screened and found to carry a thrombophilic defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-inherited-thrombophilia-in-asymptomatic-adults/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].</p><p>In addition, individuals can be educated about precautions and early symptoms. As an example, women can be made aware of the <span class=\"nowrap\">risk/benefit</span> ratio associated with oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy and make more informed decisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-inherited-thrombophilia-in-asymptomatic-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This applies particularly to individuals who are heterozygous for protein C, protein S, and antithrombin deficiency, conditions that appear to have a higher thrombosis risk than heterozygous factor V Leiden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-inherited-thrombophilia-in-asymptomatic-adults/abstract/5,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,12</a>].

Infrequently, a second hereditary defect, particularly factor V Leiden, is identified in a patient with one of the other inherited thrombophilic defects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-causes-of-venous-thrombosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the causes of venous thrombosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Carriers of two defects seem to be at a higher risk for thrombosis than their relatives with a single defect. In one review of four studies, approximately 75 percent of the family members who were carriers of two defects had experienced thrombosis compared with 10 to 30 percent of the carriers of a single defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-inherited-thrombophilia-in-asymptomatic-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, these data may reflect an artificially elevated risk based on reporting bias.</p><p>The lack of utility of screening asymptomatic relatives of homozygous probands with a negative family history of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is supported by a study that retrospectively evaluated the risk of VTE in family members of individuals with inherited defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-inherited-thrombophilia-in-asymptomatic-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This study found that VTE was <strong>less</strong> likely in homozygotes for factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A with a negative family history of VTE than in individuals who were heterozygous for an inherited defect with a positive family history of VTE (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.3; 95% CI 1.3-5.4 and HR 4.1; 95% CI 1.2-14.7, respectively).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Protein C deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with protein C deficiency are at potential risk of warfarin-induced skin necrosis and should be aware of this diagnosis, if present.

If a vitamin K antagonist is used, the dose should be increased gradually, starting from a relatively low dose (eg, warfarin 2 mg daily).

One study, for example, evaluated 78 women with inherited deficiency in antithrombin, protein S, or protein C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-inherited-thrombophilia-in-asymptomatic-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Deep vein thrombosis occurred in 18 percent of patients with type I antithrombin deficiency during pregnancy and in 33 percent in the postpartum period. By comparison, thrombosis during pregnancy occurred in only 7 percent of patients with protein C deficiency and in none of the patients with protein S deficiency. Thrombosis in the postpartum period occurred in 19 percent of protein C and 17 percent of protein S deficient patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithrombin-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antithrombin deficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As a result, women with antithrombin deficiency should receive anticoagulant prophylaxis with low molecular weight (LMW) heparin during pregnancy and for six weeks postpartum.

Following an informed discussion with such patients with VTE and thrombophilia, we recommend screening first-degree family members for the identified defect.

In reproductive-aged women, both the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) with estrogen-progestin use (30 to 40 events per 100,000 person-years) and the estimated mortality rate from VTE (3 per 1 million for estrogen-progestin users and 14 per 1 million in estrogen-progestin users with the factor V Leiden mutation) are so low that the number of women who would need to be screened for inherited thrombophilias to prevent one death is very large (more than 92,000 FVL carriers in one American study) and the cost of screening to prevent one death would be extremely high (more than USD $300 million) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-inherited-thrombophilia-in-asymptomatic-adults/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Screening for inherited thrombophilia prior to initiating estrogen-progestin contraception may be appropriate in women with no personal history of VTE if a first-degree relative has a history of VTE associated with inherited thrombophilia; or if multiple first-degree relatives have a history of VTE, particularly at a younger age (eg, &lt;50 years). The detection of single or multiple genetic defects in the patient provides information that is helpful for her in balancing the risks and benefits of using estrogen-progestin contraceptives and making a contraceptive choice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-inherited-thrombophilia-in-asymptomatic-adults/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>]. This is especially true for individuals with antithrombin deficiency, protein S deficiency, or protein C deficiency, and less clear for those with the factor V Leiden mutation or the prothrombin G20210A mutation. Estrogen-progestin contraception is not strongly contraindicated in women heterozygous for these mutations, given the smaller increase in VTE risk related to these thrombophilias compared with other thrombophilias. We individualize decisions about screening based on the specific details of the family history (eg, age of occurrence, provoked versus unprovoked, number of VTE events) and patient values and preferences. If the appropriateness of screening a specific patient is unclear, referral to a hematologist can be useful.</p><p/><p>We do not screen for inherited thrombophilia in women with a personal history of VTE when the purpose of screening is to inform counseling about estrogen-progestin contraceptives as a contraception option. Screening results would not affect this decision, as we and most other clinicians would advise against starting or continuing estrogen-progestin contraceptives after a previous thrombotic episode because of the risk of recurrent VTE.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

Common causes include Factor V Leiden (the most common condition), the prothrombin gene mutation, and deficiencies in protein S, protein C, and antithrombin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unselected population-based screening for inherited thrombophilic states is not recommended because of their low frequency, low penetrance, and lack of a safe, cost-effective, long-term method of prophylaxis if an abnormality is found. Specifically, there are no data that justify the risks of prophylactic anticoagulation in the asymptomatic patient with inherited thrombophilia. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Arguments against screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The benefits of screening are likely to be significant in the asymptomatic family member with thrombophilia <strong>only</strong> if there is a strong family history of VTE (ie, multiple first-degree relatives with thrombotic events prior to age 50); such histories are more common in patients with deficiencies of antithrombin, protein C, or protein S.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, in certain high thrombotic risk situations (eg, major surgery, trauma, immobilization for &gt;7 days, pregnancy and puerperium), screening for inherited thrombophilia, if present, may prompt consideration of prophylactic treatment or alteration in the <span class=\"nowrap\">type/duration</span> of antithrombotic prophylaxis. These scenarios include (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Screening for specific inherited thrombophilias'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Screening in high risk situations'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Presence of homozygosity for the Factor V Leiden or prothrombin gene mutations or multiple thrombophilic defects</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Initiation of vitamin K antagonists in patients with protein C deficiency given potential for the rare complication of warfarin-induced skin necrosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Consideration of antithrombin concentrate administration in antithrombin deficiency in the peri-partum period in pregnant women or in conjunction with surgical procedures when anticoagulants cannot be safely administered (eg, during delivery or immediately following neurosurgery or spinal surgery)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We typically do not screen women taking oral contraceptives for inherited thrombophilia unless a first-degree relative has inherited thrombophilia and clinical thromboembolic disease.
