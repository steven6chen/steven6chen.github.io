Its explosive and unexpected nature is likened to a &quot;clap of thunder.&quot; Although TCH initially referred to pain associated with an unruptured intracranial aneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-thunderclap-headache/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], multiple etiologies are now recognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-thunderclap-headache/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81710\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81710 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>This topic will review the clinical presentation, etiologies, and diagnostic evaluation of TCH.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3057801386\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A thunderclap headache (TCH) is a very severe headache of abrupt onset that reaches its maximum intensity within <strong>one minute or less</strong> of onset. The key feature that differentiates TCH from other headaches is the rapidity with which it develops; extreme severity alone is insufficient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-thunderclap-headache/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Other severe headaches may be worrisome and compel a diagnostic evaluation, but would not qualify as TCH unless reaching maximum intensity quickly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H237916366\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The underlying pathophysiology of primary thunderclap headache (TCH) and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndromes (RCVS) is unclear. Excessive sympathetic activity or an abnormal vascular response to circulating catecholamines may be involved. This would explain the occurrence of TCH during physical activity, in patients with pheochromocytoma, acute hypertensive crises, and in patients who take sympathomimetic drugs or tyramine containing foods concurrently with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. In further support of this hypothesis, reversible cerebral vasoconstriction like that which can occur with some cases of TCH has been documented in pheochromocytoma, eclampsia, sympathomimetic drug intoxication, and autonomic dysreflexia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-thunderclap-headache/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>].</p><p>Although vasoconstriction can be initiated by mechanical and biochemical stimuli, a neurogenic mechanism is implied when vasoconstriction is associated with the abrupt onset of headache. Sympathetic afferents that innervate the intracranial vasculature contain neuropeptide Y and noradrenaline, both vasoconstrictors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-thunderclap-headache/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Vascular caliber may be a reflection of sympathetic tone and sympathetic receptor sensitivity, and TCH may be a result of spontaneous and abnormal central sympathetic response. This theory is supported by models of vasospasm in subarachnoid hemorrhage as well as the clinical finding of multifocal vasospasm in patients with pheochromocytoma and sympathomimetic drug intoxication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-thunderclap-headache/abstract/4,6,7,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,7,11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2767105498\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A thunderclap headache (TCH) is a very severe headache of abrupt onset that reaches its maximum intensity within <strong>one minute or less</strong> of onset. Patients may present with TCH either in isolation or accompanied by additional symptoms and signs (eg, meningismus, fever, tinnitus, orthostatic worsening of headache, altered mental state, seizure, motor or sensory deficits, or cranial nerve palsies) that reflect the underlying cause. Given the serious and potentially life-threatening nature of underlying intracranial etiologies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81710\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81710 \">table 1</a>), TCH is a medical emergency requiring immediate evaluation.

While there are no symptoms or signs that can reliably differentiate primary from secondary TCH, the following features are associated with increased odds of subarachnoid hemorrhage in a patient with TCH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-thunderclap-headache/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impaired consciousness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neck stiffness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea, vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exertion or Valsalva immediately preceding onset of TCH</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated blood pressure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occipital headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of smoking </p><p/><p>Whether or not these features are present, all patients with TCH need to be evaluated for subarachnoid hemorrhage and other underlying causes (see <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> below). Misdiagnosis or delay in diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage is not uncommon. Misdiagnosis occurs because of failure to recognize the spectrum of possible presentations of subarachnoid hemorrhage, lack of knowledge regarding the limitations of head CT, and failure to perform lumbar puncture and interpret cerebrospinal fluid tests correctly. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage'</a>.)</p><p>Initial evaluation for subarachnoid hemorrhage must include noncontrast CT of the brain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F114084\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef114084 \">algorithm 1</a>). Lumbar puncture is indicated when there is clinical suspicion of subarachnoid hemorrhage and the head CT is normal.</p><p>The diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage as well as the utility of head CT and lumbar puncture are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage'</a> and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Sentinel headache</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A sentinel headache is an episode of headache similar to that accompanying subarachnoid hemorrhage but occurring days to weeks prior to aneurysm rupture. Ten to 43 percent of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage report a history of a sentinel or warning headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-thunderclap-headache/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Sentinel headaches develop over seconds, reach maximal intensity within minutes, and may endure for hours to days. Features of subarachnoid hemorrhage, including stiff neck, altered consciousness, and focal neurologic symptoms and signs are usually absent. Sentinel headaches may be caused by small aneurysmal leaks of blood into the subarachnoid space or physical changes within the aneurysm wall. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p>It is essential to recognize TCH as a possible warning of aneurysm rupture. When the evaluation reveals an unruptured intracranial aneurysm in a patient with TCH and no subarachnoid hemorrhage, causality often cannot be determined, and the question may remain as to whether the aneurysm is an incidental finding. Therefore, such patients should be fully evaluated for other possible causes of TCH. The unruptured aneurysm should be managed according to an individualized analysis that incorporates factors including the risk of aneurysm rupture according to size and location, comorbid medical illness, patient age, and risks of treatment. These issues are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unruptured intracranial aneurysms&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, sentinel headaches are often ignored by both patients and clinicians or are misdiagnosed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58555038\"><span class=\"h2\">Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndromes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RCVS are a group of conditions characterized by reversible segmental narrowing of the cerebral arteries.

In the ensuing days, many patients go on to develop complications such as ischemic strokes, convexal (nonaneurysmal) subarachnoid hemorrhages, lobar hemorrhages, and reversible brain edema, alone or in combination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reversible-cerebral-vasoconstriction-syndromes#H185045507\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndromes&quot;, section on 'Brain imaging'</a>.)</p><p>Cerebral angiographic abnormalities are dynamic and progress proximally, resulting in a &quot;sausage on a string&quot; appearance of the circle of Willis arteries and their branches. These abnormalities begin to resolve spontaneously (without specific therapy) over a few weeks.

Rare patients develop severe irreversible deficits or death from progressive strokes or cerebral edema. Recurrence of an episode of RCVS is rare.

In addition to headaches, patients with cerebral venous thrombosis usually present with some combination of papilledema, seizures, bilateral focal deficits, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> altered level of consciousness. However, about 15 percent of patients may present with isolated headache.

MRI with venography should be considered when cerebral venous thrombosis is suspected, as initial testing for a suspected diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage with head CT and lumbar puncture will not always detect cerebral venous thrombosis. In patients with cerebral venous thrombosis who have normal neurologic exams, the head CT is normal in approximately 25 percent, whereas in patients with cerebral venous thrombosis who have focal neurologic signs, the head CT is normal in less than 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-thunderclap-headache/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].

Diagnostic criteria from the International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition (ICHD-3) beta for headache secondary to cervical artery dissection stipulate that the headache must be ipsilateral to the dissected artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-thunderclap-headache/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p>Cervical artery dissection can cause ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, or rarely, subarachnoid hemorrhage. In addition to neck pain and headache, other local manifestations of dissection can include a Horner syndrome, pulsatile tinnitus, an audible bruit, or cranial neuropathies. Common causes of dissection include various degrees of trauma or spontaneous events, with underlying predispositions in some cases. Dissection can also result from major head and neck trauma, but most dissections occur spontaneously or after minor or trivial injury.

Additional diagnostic tests are necessary if there is clinical suspicion for cervical artery dissection; these could include ultrasound, CT angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, conventional angiography, or MRI of the neck with a fat saturation protocol. The diagnosis is confirmed by neuroimaging findings, particularly the demonstration of a long tapered arterial stenosis, a tapered occlusion, a dissecting aneurysm (pseudoaneurysm), an intimal flap, a double lumen, or an intramural hematoma.

In most cases, headaches associated with stroke are not consistent with TCH. However, several cases of ischemic stroke associated with TCH have been reported, including cases in which TCH was the primary clinical feature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-thunderclap-headache/abstract/24,40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,40-42</a>]. CT and lumbar puncture may be nondiagnostic in patients with TCH and recent stroke, suggesting the necessity of MRI in such cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute hypertensive crisis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TCH may be a presenting feature of acute hypertensive crisis and reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS, also known as posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome or PRES). In one case report, a patient presented with hypertension, TCH, and white matter abnormalities on MRI involving the parieto-occipital regions consistent with <span class=\"nowrap\">RPLS/PRES</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-thunderclap-headache/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>There is increasing recognition of overlap between <span class=\"nowrap\">RPLS/PRES</span> and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome or RCVS (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reversible-cerebral-vasoconstriction-syndromes#H185045483\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndromes&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-thunderclap-headache/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. As an example, in a report of a patient with recurrent thunderclap headaches and a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, angiography revealed diffuse, multifocal, segmental vasospasm involving the arteries of the circle of Willis and its branches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-thunderclap-headache/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Up to one third of patients with RCVS develop vasogenic edematous lesions in the cerebral or cerebellar hemispheres, and infarction or intraparenchymal hemorrhage may occur within these zones of vasogenic edema. Therefore, patients presenting with TCH and imaging evidence of <span class=\"nowrap\">RPLS/PRES</span> should undergo magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or computed tomography angiography (CTA) to determine whether cerebral artery vasoconstriction is present. This is particularly important in those with hypertension, since aggressive antihypertensive therapy may increase the risk of <span class=\"nowrap\">cerebral/borderzone</span> infarction in the setting of cerebral vasoconstriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-thunderclap-headache/abstract/44,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,46</a>].</p><p>Consideration of acute hypertensive crisis and <span class=\"nowrap\">RPLS/PRES</span> as a possible cause of TCH is important for accurate diagnosis.

In the presence of <span class=\"nowrap\">RPLS/PRES,</span> patients may have visual changes, altered mental status, seizures, and focal neurologic signs. Evaluation with head CT and lumbar puncture may miss the diagnosis of <span class=\"nowrap\">RPLS/PRES</span>. MRI is more sensitive than head CT for revealing the white matter and cortical edema associated with <span class=\"nowrap\">RPLS/PRES</span>. These changes typically involve the parietal and occipital lobes and may also involve the basal ganglia, brainstem, and cerebellum. Since the imaging changes are secondary to vasogenic edema and not ischemia or infarction, prompt treatment of the hypertension is essential and should result in correction of the associated clinical syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1238830880\"><span class=\"h2\">Pituitary apoplexy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pituitary apoplexy is caused by hemorrhage or infarction of the pituitary gland in the setting of a pituitary adenoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-thunderclap-headache/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The clinical presentation of pituitary apoplexy ranges from relatively mild symptoms to more severe symptoms including acute headache, ophthalmoplegia, decreased visual acuity, change in mental status, adrenal crisis, coma, or even sudden death. TCH may be a predominant feature. </p><p>Pituitary apoplexy can present with TCH in patients who have normal physical examinations, head CT scans, and cerebrospinal fluid analyses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-thunderclap-headache/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. Pituitary tumors that are isodense to normal brain tissue may be easily overlooked on CT studies, even if hemorrhage is present. Brain MRI has a much higher sensitivity than CT for detecting the tumor and associated blood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Colloid cyst of the third ventricle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with colloid cysts of the third ventricle may also present with TCH when the cyst, which can act like a ball valve, suddenly impedes the flow of cerebrospinal fluid, causing acute obstructive hydrocephalus. Headache is reported by 68 to 100 percent of patients with third ventricular colloid cysts, making it the most commonly associated symptom.</p><p>Typically, the headache has an acute onset and resolution, with a duration of seconds to one day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-thunderclap-headache/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. The pain is often severe and may be relieved by taking the supine position.

Since several of the underlying causes of TCH are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, the clinician must initially presume that the patient presenting with TCH has a secondary TCH. Only after a comprehensive evaluation for underlying causes is negative should the diagnosis of primary TCH be considered.</p><p>All patients with TCH should have a head CT without contrast as soon as possible after the onset of TCH (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F114084\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef114084 \">algorithm 1</a>). If the head CT does not reveal the cause, a lumbar puncture should be performed urgently to obtain the opening pressure and to evaluate the cerebrospinal fluid for evidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage or other causes of TCH.</p><p>All patients with a nondiagnostic head CT and nondiagnostic lumbar puncture should have a brain MRI with contrast and noninvasive neurovascular imaging of the head and neck arteries, which can be obtained using magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or computed tomography angiography (CTA).</p><p>Cerebral venous and sinus imaging should be obtained with magnetic resonance venography (MRV) or computed tomography venography (CTV) in patients presenting with TCH to exclude the presence of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. The clinical features that suggest the possibility of cerebral venous thrombosis include papilledema, seizures, focal neurologic symptoms, or cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities such as elevated opening pressure, lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated red cell count, or elevated protein.</p><p>The clinical features, lumbar puncture, and imaging characteristics of the more common causes of TCH (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F113418\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113418 \">table 2</a>) should be kept in mind.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13406751\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation for subarachnoid hemorrhage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A sudden-onset headache, though not necessarily a TCH, is characteristic of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Approximately one-half of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage present with TCH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-thunderclap-headache/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The evaluation for subarachnoid hemorrhage is reviewed here briefly and discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage#H34\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot;, section on 'Identifying the etiology'</a>.)</p><p>Brain CT without contrast, the first test in the evaluation of TCH (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F114084\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef114084 \">algorithm 1</a>), is highly sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage within the first 12 to 24 hours. During the first 12 hours following onset of headache, third-generation CT scanners have a sensitivity nearing 100 percent and a specificity of 98 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-thunderclap-headache/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. However, these numbers are based upon studies that used expert neuroradiologists to interpret the scans. Depending upon local availability, CT angiography can be performed at the time of the initial head CT to evaluate for aneurysms and vasoconstriction.</p><p>In general practice, clinicians may easily overlook subtle imaging abnormalities on CT that are suggestive of subarachnoid hemorrhage. In addition, the sensitivity of head CT in subarachnoid hemorrhage declines rapidly over time, decreasing to 86 percent on day two, 76 percent after two days, and 58 percent after five days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-thunderclap-headache/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Therefore, lumbar puncture is required in the evaluation of patients presenting with TCH who have CT scans interpreted as normal or inadequate. Lumbar puncture should include measurement of opening pressure (which may be elevated in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage or cerebral venous thrombosis), routine cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses including cell counts, and visual inspection for xanthochromia.</p><p>Some experts recommend the use of CSF spectrophotometry, if available, to measure xanthochromia, especially when a traumatic tap makes CSF interpretation difficult or when the specimen has been improperly processed. The sensitivity of spectrophotometry approaches 100 percent when lumbar puncture is performed 12 hours to two weeks after subarachnoid hemorrhage onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-thunderclap-headache/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Despite its high sensitivity, spectrophotometry has only low to moderate specificity for the diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage and is not universally recommended. As a practical matter, spectrophotometry is rarely available in North American hospitals. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot;, section on 'Lumbar puncture'</a>.)</p><p>A negative head CT and lumbar puncture effectively eliminate the diagnosis of SAH as long as both tests are performed within a few days of the event. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58554876\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation for other causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The exact role of brain MRI in the evaluation of TCH has not yet been defined, but MRI is more sensitive than head CT for many of the possible underlying causes of TCH, such as cerebral venous thrombosis, cervical artery dissection, spontaneous intracranial hypotension, and reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome.</p><p>Therefore, for patients with TCH who have a negative work-up for subarachnoid hemorrhage (ie, a nondiagnostic head CT and lumbar puncture), we recommend obtaining brain MRI with contrast and imaging of the cerebral vasculature with MR angiography and MR venography.

The wide range of these findings is attributable to the use of different criteria for defining and diagnosing TCH among the various studies, and to the inclusion of patients from variable settings (eg, emergency room versus outpatient). While all of the cited studies used brain CT and lumbar puncture for diagnosis, angiography was either not used or was used sparingly. This may have led to missed diagnoses of certain conditions, such as the reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndromes, and to underestimation of secondary TCH frequency.</p><p>Subarachnoid hemorrhage is consistently the most frequent cause for TCH in these series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-thunderclap-headache/abstract/24,26,35,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26,35,58</a>]. Other vascular conditions (ie, cervical artery dissection, cerebral venous thrombosis, and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndromes) are the next most frequent secondary causes of TCH; these disorders can present with TCH in isolation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-thunderclap-headache/abstract/2,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,59</a>]. Supporting evidence comes from a series of 56 consecutive patients with recurrent thunderclap headache of unknown etiology, including no evidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage on both CT head and cerebrospinal fluid examination, who were referred to a headache clinic in Taiwan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-thunderclap-headache/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) performed at a mean interval of 11 days after the first headache attack showed segmental vasoconstriction involving Circle of Willis vessels in 39 percent (see <a href=\"#H58555038\" class=\"local\">'Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndromes'</a> above). This finding must be interpreted cautiously, since the utility of MRA for determination of segmental vasoconstriction is not established. Nevertheless, this report illustrates the potential for serious causes of TCH other than subarachnoid hemorrhage and the importance of a thorough investigation, including vascular imaging of the extracranial and intracranial circulation, in all patients presenting with TCH who have no evidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of TCH depends on the underlying etiology.
