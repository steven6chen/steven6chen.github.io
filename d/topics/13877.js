Approximately 95 percent of patients have associated gallstones. Patients with a porcelain gallbladder are often asymptomatic. The diagnosis is usually made incidentally on abdominal imaging. Porcelain gallbladder is associated with an increased risk for gallbladder cancer, but the magnitude of risk appears to be small. This topic will review the epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of porcelain gallbladder. Gallbladder cancer, uncomplicated gallstone disease, acalculous cholecystitis, and acute cholecystitis are discussed separately.

It has a female preponderance (5:1) and is usually diagnosed in the sixth decade of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porcelain-gallbladder/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H865414024\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of malignancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of gallbladder carcinoma in patients with porcelain gallbladder is approximately 2 to 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porcelain-gallbladder/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In a systematic review of seven series that included 60,665 patients who underwent cholecystectomy, 140 (0.2 percent) had porcelain gallbladder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porcelain-gallbladder/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Of those with porcelain gallbladder, 21 (15 percent) had gallbladder cancer. However, the high rates of gallbladder cancer were seen primarily in older studies. Among the 85 patients with porcelain gallbladder from studies reported between 2001 and 2011, gallbladder cancer was seen in two (2.3 percent; range 0 to 5 percent for the individual studies). </p><p>Patients with selective mucosal calcification of the gallbladder wall appear to be at higher risk for gallbladder cancer compared with those in whom the gallbladder wall is completely calcified (complete type) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porcelain-gallbladder/abstract/2-4,6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4,6-9</a>]. In a series of 44 patients with gallbladder calcification who underwent cholecystectomy, 17 had complete intramural calcification, and 27 had selective (incomplete) mucosal calcification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porcelain-gallbladder/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Gallbladder cancer was present in two of the patients with selective mucosal calcification (7 percent) and in none of the patients with complete calcification. A potential explanation for the difference in the risk of gallbladder cancer is that since gallbladder cancer is mucosal in origin and patients with the complete type of porcelain gallbladder have a low risk due to loss of mucosal epithelium. (See <a href=\"#H266584398\" class=\"local\">'Terminology and subtypes'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasonography'</a> below.)</p><p>The most common type of malignancy associated with porcelain gallbladder is adenocarcinoma, which is seen in nearly 80 percent of patients with porcelain gallbladder who develop gallbladder cancer. Squamous cell carcinoma and adenosquamous carcinoma have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porcelain-gallbladder/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gallbladder cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4224467731\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of gallbladder wall calcification is controversial. Porcelain gallbladder is associated with cholelithiasis in more than 95 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porcelain-gallbladder/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. It has been suggested that the chronic inflammation due to gallstones results in scarring, hyalinization, and calcification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porcelain-gallbladder/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. An alternative hypothesis is that cystic duct obstruction leads to bile stagnation within the gallbladder followed by mucosal precipitation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-carbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium carbonate</a> salts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porcelain-gallbladder/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3096037830\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H543570961\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients are often asymptomatic, but occasionally present with symptoms due to complications of <span class=\"nowrap\">gallstone/gallbladder</span> disease. This includes right upper <span class=\"nowrap\">quadrant/epigastric</span> abdominal pain, jaundice, or fever due to common duct obstruction, cholangitis, or pancreatitis. Rarely, the gallbladder may be palpable as a firm, nontender mass in the right upper quadrant. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2852601158\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidental imaging finding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Porcelain gallbladder may be detected on abdominal imaging (abdominal radiographs, ultrasound, or abdominal computed tomography [CT] scan). Plain abdominal radiographs may reveal curvilinear or rim-like calcifications in the gallbladder wall (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80792\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80792 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porcelain-gallbladder/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, similar findings can also be seen if the gallbladder is full of bile that is supersaturated with calcium salts (milk of calcium bile) or due to calcifications in gallstones, renal cysts, chest wall masses, and degenerative cystic lesions of the pancreas and adrenal gland. Abdominal radiographs are not diagnostic for porcelain gallbladder due to their low sensitivity and specificity. Diagnostic imaging modalities for porcelain gallbladder include abdominal CT scan and ultrasound. (See <a href=\"#H3982553311\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic imaging'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Porcelain gallbladder is usually discovered incidentally on abdominal imaging. The diagnosis is established by the presence of curvilinear or granular calcification of the gallbladder wall on abdominal computerized tomogram or ultrasound. In patients in whom porcelain gallbladder is suspected based on an abdominal radiograph or diagnosed on abdominal ultrasound, we perform an abdominal computed tomography because it has a high sensitivity for calcification and gallbladder cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porcelain-gallbladder/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A definitive diagnosis of porcelain gallbladder is made by histopathological evaluation of the gallbladder after cholecystectomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gallbladder cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3982553311\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic imaging</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Computed tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan in patients with porcelain gallbladder, the gallbladder wall appears as a calcified rim with a dark central bile-filled region (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F60124\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60124 \">image 2</a>). Findings suggestive of gallbladder cancer that may be visualized on abdominal CT include a polypoid mass protruding into the lumen or completely filling it, focal or diffuse thickening of the gallbladder wall, or a mass in the gallbladder fossa with the gallbladder itself being indiscernible; liver invasion, suspected nodal involvement, or distant metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porcelain-gallbladder/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gallbladder cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'CT and MRI'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sonographic appearance of porcelain gallbladder depends on the extent of calcification. When the gallbladder wall is heavily calcified and the wall is diffusely involved, calcification appears as an echogenic arc with clean posterior acoustic shadowing. Less extensive calcification results in partial shadowing such that the posterior wall of the gallbladder remains visible. In early cases, only segments of the gallbladder wall may be affected.</p><p>Three distinct sonographic patterns have been described in patients with porcelain gallbladder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porcelain-gallbladder/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type I &ndash; A hyperechoic semilunar appearance with posterior acoustic shadowing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80835\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80835 \">image 3</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type II &ndash; A biconvex curvilinear echogenic appearance with variable acoustic shadowing.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type III &ndash; Irregular clumps of echoes with posterior acoustic shadowing.</p><p/><p>Type I corresponds to the complete intramural calcification. Type II and III correspond to selective mucosal calcification. (See <a href=\"#H266584398\" class=\"local\">'Terminology and subtypes'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1843205874\"><span class=\"h2\">Histopathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Porcelain gallbladder has two histologic patterns:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Broad continuous band of calcification within the muscularis. This appears radiologically as large plaque-like areas. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple punctate calcifications in the glandular spaces of the mucosa. This pattern results in the radiographic appearance of granular calcification (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F70858\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70858 \">picture 1</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H68081279\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of porcelain gallbladder on imaging includes cholelithiasis and emphysematous cholecystitis. These entities can be distinguished based on abdominal ultrasound. However, in some cases, abdominal computed tomography may be required. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cholelithiasis</strong> &ndash; A stone-filled gallbladder is another cause of shadowing in the gallbladder fossa. However, in patients with cholelithiasis there is a thin hypoechoic bile space between the gallbladder wall and the gallstone echo. The presence of a wall echo shadow complex is suggestive of a stone-filled collapsed gallbladder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uncomplicated gallstone disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Emphysematous cholecystitis</strong> &ndash; Patients with emphysematous cholecystitis may also have an echogenic crescent in the gallbladder fossa. Ring-down shadows from gas within the gallbladder wall on ultrasound can mimic calcification in patients with porcelain gallbladder. However, emphysematous cholecystitis produces dirty acoustic shadowing. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4169808031\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1412892144\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our approach to the management of porcelain gallbladder is based on the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms or complications of <span class=\"nowrap\">gallstone/gallbladder</span> disease.

(See <a href=\"#H865414024\" class=\"local\">'Risk of malignancy'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Symptomatic or selective mucosal calcification</strong> &ndash; We refer patients with complete mural calcification for cholecystectomy if they are symptomatic. We suggest surgery for all patients with selective mucosal calcification, given their increased risk for gallbladder cancer.

(See <a href=\"#H220327120\" class=\"local\">'Conservative management'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The management of porcelain gallbladder is controversial. Historically, porcelain gallbladder has generally been seen as an indication for cholecystectomy, even in asymptomatic patients. However, given that the risk appears to be lower than previously thought, some experts suggest that patients with porcelain gallbladder be observed, with surgery being reserved for those with conventional indications for cholecystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porcelain-gallbladder/abstract/6,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11</a>]. Others experts have challenged this recommendation, noting that the rate of gallbladder cancer seen in more recent studies (2 to 3 percent) is high enough to justify prophylactic cholecystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porcelain-gallbladder/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Dissection can initially be performed laparoscopically with the plan to convert to an open procedure if necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porcelain-gallbladder/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The surgeon should maintain a high index of suspicion for gallbladder cancer. A frozen section should be performed of any suspicious areas of the gallbladder.
