A limitation of most of studies of this issue is that malformations among miscarriages, pregnancy terminations, and stillbirths were not assessed.</p><p>A current hypothesis is that hypertension, rather than ACE inhibitors or other antihypertensive therapies, is the risk factor for development of congenital anomalies. In various studies, an increased risk of congenital cardiac malformations was noted in offspring of hypertensive women whether or not they took antihypertensive drugs and regardless of the class of antihypertensive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-pregnancy/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>]. In one of the largest cohort studies, women with chronic hypertension and first trimester exposure to ACE inhibitors (n = 2631) had no increased risk of overall major congenital, cardiac, or central nervous system malformations compared with hypertensive women not exposed to ACE inhibitors (n = 15,884), after adjustment for diabetes and other confounders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-pregnancy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. On the other hand, when the indication for ACE inhibitor treatment was not considered in the analysis, the 4107 exposed pregnancies had more overall congenital malformations (5.9 versus 3.3 percent) and cardiac malformations (3.4 versus 1.2 percent) than the 1.3 million unexposed pregnancies. Potential indications for ACE inhibitors include diabetes, proteinuria, heart failure, hypertension, and post myocardial infarction.</p><p>The first report of possible harm was a 2006 epidemiologic study that evaluated Medicaid data on 29,507 infants born in Tennessee between 1985 and 2000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Of these infants, 209 were exposed to ACE inhibitors in the first trimester only, 202 were exposed to other antihypertensive agents in the first trimester, and the remainder had no exposure to antihypertensive drugs. The following findings were reported:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exposure to non-ACE inhibitor, non-ARB antihypertensive drugs in the first trimester was not associated with a significant increase in risk of malformations (RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.25-1.75).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of major congenital malformations was significantly increased among infants exposed to ACE inhibitors in the first trimester compared to those with no exposure to antihypertensive drugs (risk ratio [RR] 2.7; 95% CI 1.7-4.3; malformation rate: 7.1 versus 2.6 percent of births).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The congenital anomalies with the highest relative risk were cardiovascular malformations (RR 3.7; malformation rate: 2.9 versus 0.8 percent of births) and central nervous system (CNS) malformations (RR 4.4; malformation rate: 1.5 versus 0.3 percent of births); however, the number of affected infants was small.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The cardiovascular anomalies consisted of atrial <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ventricular septal defect (seven infants) and patent ductus arteriosus (two infants).

Histological lesions consistent with renal tubular dysgenesis have been observed in affected neonates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-pregnancy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Oligohydramnios increases the risk of umbilical cord compression and, in turn, fetal death. Severe oligohydramnios can lead to poor pulmonary development (pulmonary hypoplasia) and development of limb contractures and skeletal deformations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-pregnancy/abstract/1,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8,9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oligohydramnios#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oligohydramnios&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a>.) Hypocalvaria, retinopathy, and prolonged neonatal hypotension have also been observed with second or third trimester ACE inhibitor exposure. </p><p>Other observed adverse effects, such as nonreassuring findings on antepartum fetal assessment, spontaneous or medically-indicated preterm birth, and low birth <span class=\"nowrap\">weight/growth</span> restriction, are difficult to evaluate since the underlying maternal conditions for which ACE inhibitors and ARBs are commonly prescribed (eg, hypertension, renal insufficiency, heart failure) are also associated with these complications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1161897\"><span class=\"h2\">Exposure through breast milk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ACE inhibitors are transferred into breast milk, but have very low levels in the milk. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=captopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Captopril</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enalapril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enalapril</a> are not expected to cause adverse effects in breastfed infants. However, newborns may be more susceptible to the hemodynamic effects of these drugs, such as hypotension, and sequelae, such as oliguria and seizures. Therefore, the hemodynamic status of the infant should be taken into account when deciding whether women taking these drugs should breastfeed.</p><p>There is no information on the use of ARBs during breastfeeding. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27568614\"><span class=\"h1\">HYPOTHESES FOR PATHOGENESIS OF ADVERSE EFFECTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The adverse fetal renal effects of ACE inhibitors and ARBs are likely consequences of their ability to cross the placenta and interfere with fetal renal hemodynamics. Because the fetal circulation is characterized by low perfusion pressures, high angiotensin II levels are needed to maintain the GFR. ACE inhibitors and ARBs rapidly reduce angiotensin II levels, thereby reducing intraglomerular pressure and inducing a decline in GFR, which is reflected by oligohydramnios in utero and anuria after delivery. In animal studies, loss of function mutations in renin-angiotensin system (RAS) genes similarly results in abnormal renal development (eg, renal tubular dysgenesis), reduced fetal diuresis, and oligohydramnios [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-pregnancy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p>Experimental evidence also suggests that angiotensin II may participate in the regulation of uteroplacental blood flow, perhaps by stimulating vascular production of vasodilator prostaglandins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-pregnancy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Thus, inhibition of angiotensin II could lead to fetal growth restriction. Angiotensin II may also play a direct role in fetal growth and development, particularly of the fetal kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-pregnancy/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Retinopathy and hypocalvaria in exposed fetuses has been attributed to drug-related reductions in normal retinal and cranial vascularization during fetal development rather than to oxygen toxicity or deformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-pregnancy/abstract/8,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,23</a>].</p><p>In addition to these effects, AT<sub>1</sub> receptor blockade results in the disinhibition of renin release by angiotensin II and increased formation of all angiotensin peptides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-pregnancy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. These peptides could activate the AT<sub>2</sub> receptor, which is highly expressed in the fetus. However, the consequences of this effect are unknown. A brief review of the actions of angiotensin II on glomerular hemodynamics can be found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-effects-of-ace-inhibitors-in-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal effects of ACE inhibitors in hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">LONG-TERM PROGNOSIS OF SYMPTOMATIC NEONATES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Renal function may appear to improve over time in infants, but the long-term outcome in survivors has not been well described. Three reports including a total of five children with in utero exposure to ACE inhibitors associated with transient acute renal failure in the neonatal period have been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-pregnancy/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. Four of these five neonates developed mild renal insufficiency during childhood. Another report of a child exposed to an ARB during pregnancy described chronic kidney disease and development delay at 34 months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-pregnancy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. A series of seven cases of ARB exposure during pregnancy reported several cases of irreversible neonatal renal failure and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Although data are sparse, they suggest that renal function should be monitored in children with a history of transient neonatal renal failure related to exposure to ACE inhibitors and ARBs in utero.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1161932\"><span class=\"h1\">USE OF ACE INHIBITORS AND ARBS IN WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING POTENTIAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The avoidance of ACE inhibitors and ARBs at any stage of pregnancy is justified by the strength of the observed associations and by the availability of other agents that are effective for blood pressure control. As a result, all women in childbearing years who are being considered for therapy with ACE inhibitors <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ARBs should be counseled about the potential fetal risks associated with these agents.</p><p>Although well conducted observational research, including the systematic review and meta-analysis described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-pregnancy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], has questioned the association between first-trimester ACE inhibitor use and congenital (particularly cardiac) abnormalities, these drugs should be avoided throughout pregnancy because of the proven risks of exposure in second and third trimester. There is less information about the risk of congenital malformations associated with first-trimester exposure to ARBs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-pregnancy/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>], but the available literature suggests that these agents have the same risks as ACE inhibitors; thus, similar concerns apply. We are not aware of cases of exposure to direct renin inhibitors during pregnancy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aliskiren-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aliskiren</a>); however, given the similar impact on the renin angiotensin system, we avoid these drugs during pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2976324195\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest avoidance of ACE inhibitors or ARBs in women of childbearing age for whom there are reasonable alternative anti-hypertensive drugs that would be safer for the fetus.

If her menstrual period is delayed by more than two days, the woman should discontinue her ACE inhibitor or ARB, undergo a pregnancy test (blood is more sensitive than urine in very early pregnancy), and consult her physician. The diagnosis of very early pregnancy can be challenging, given the normal variation in menstrual cycle length and the frequency of irregular menstrual cycles. A negative pregnancy test should be repeated in a few days if menses have not resumed (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-early-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of early pregnancy&quot;</a>). Abrupt cessation of an ACE inhibitor or ARB does not result in rebound hypertension.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ACE inhibitors or ARBs should be discontinued in women who present in early pregnancy on these drugs. An alternate agent is initiated, if necessary.
