These properties ensure that enough of the protein survives in a sufficiently intact form to be taken up by the gut and to be recognized by the mucosal immune system. Processing may alter the allergenicity of food [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>In addition, food allergens must possess the ability to induce a T helper cell type 2 (Th2)-biased, allergen-specific immune response via certain structural features of the allergen or association of the allergen with ligand molecules that can act as adjuvants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Studies of the interaction of allergens and the innate immune system have highlighted the roles of pattern recognition receptors in initiating Th2-biased immune responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Several members of major allergen families bind lipid ligands via hydrophobic cavities or electrostatic or hydrophobic interactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. These lipids, either present in the allergen source or originating from microbial contaminations, modulate the immune response of predisposed individuals by interacting with their innate immune system.</p><p>This topic reviews the structural and physicochemical features common to food allergens. The European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) published the EAACI Molecular Allergology User&rsquo;s Guide in May 2016, which is freely available online and contains a wealth of information on molecular features of allergens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The clinical features and cross-reactivity of food allergens and the pathogenesis of food allergy are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food allergens: Overview of clinical features and cross-reactivity&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-food-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of food allergy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A list of protein families that contain allergens can be accessed from the <a href=\"http://www.meduniwien.ac.at/allfam/&amp;token=5yvz7lCf0hefbc5ZhmpaTVzBuCJqSy+ze7alhIeYXQIjTs4q0lRtb/IVGfq+yXa0&amp;TOPIC_ID=2387\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">AllFam database of allergen families</a> website [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The <a href=\"http://www.allergen.org/&amp;token=l+W7Dl19h3W41h7E1lWGuQ8ZP9IM1Eg8VkB/+NfRISyvALUkLBSw0hah5bEtTSir&amp;TOPIC_ID=2387\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">World Health Organization (WHO)/International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS) Allergen Nomenclature database</a> contains information on all officially recognized allergens.

Stability of an allergenic protein describes its ability to maintain its original and allergenic three-dimensional structure despite being exposed to heat, harsh pH changes, and proteases. The term &quot;stability&quot; also encompasses the ability of a protein to refold to its native or near-native conformation during cooling after heat treatment. Several structural features are related to stability including the presence of disulfide bonds, glycosylation, and rheomorphism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Disulfide bonds</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The single, most important structural feature of an allergenic food protein related to its stability is the presence of disulfide bonds that are formed by pairs of cysteine residues. Intrachain disulfide bonds link segments of single-chain proteins (eg, nonspecific lipid transfer proteins [nsLTPs]) and interchain disulfide bonds link individual chains of multiple-chain proteins (eg, 2S albumins). Both types of disulfide bonds constrain the three-dimensional scaffold of a protein and protect it against denaturation by heat or protease digestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Prolamin superfamily</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prolamin superfamily is the most important protein family for plant food allergens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This superfamily is characterized by the presence of a conserved cysteine skeleton [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Many highly disulfide-bonded members of this superfamily are notable food allergens including 2S albumins, nsLTPs, and the cereal inhibitors of trypsin and alpha-amylases. Besides the prolamin superfamily, the protein stability of several members of defense-related protein families (eg, class I chitinases and thaumatin-like proteins [TLPs]) is also based upon the presence of a high number of disulfide bonds in their structures. Lists of allergens belonging to the various protein families can be viewed on the <a href=\"http://www.meduniwien.ac.at/allergens/allfam/&amp;token=5yvz7lCf0hefbc5ZhmpaTVzBuCJqSy+ze7alhIeYXQLw2Mnokge07rLQkG++PQ2ZOqPbR/hhtDs0OTbLi7hjHw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=2387\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">AllFam website</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>2S albumins &ndash; The 2S albumins are a major group of seed storage proteins that include seeds, tree nuts, and legumes. These compact molecules exhibit high thermostability and resistance to extreme pH values and proteolysis due to the presence of four conserved disulfide bonds. This stability was demonstrated in various seeds, nuts, and legumes including mustard seed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], rapeseed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], sesame seed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], sunflower seed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], Brazil nut [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>], and peanut [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Cor a 14, the 2S albumin from hazelnut, has been described as a high-risk marker for severe hazelnut allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Cor a 14 was shown to require temperatures of more than 80&deg;C to start unfolding and to be resistant to proteolytic degradation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Native and heat-treated Cor a 14 was recognized by sera from hazelnut-allergic patients. However, denaturation of the allergen led to reduced immunoglobulin E (IgE) binding. Pin p 1, the 2S albumin from pine nuts, was found to be heat stable for 120 min at 100&deg;C and to still possess a robust capacity to inhibit IgE binding to whole pine nut extract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Mass spectrometric analysis of allergens in roasted walnuts revealed that the 2S albumin Jug r 1 only underwent minor changes in solubility following heat treatments up to 180&deg;C for 20 minutes, a characteristic attributed to its disulfide-stabilized scaffold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In general, walnut proteins are relatively stable under certain thermal processing conditions, and IgE reactivity remains present even when insoluble aggregates are formed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>nsLTPs &ndash; These proteins are structurally related to the 2S albumins. They play a role in plant defense mechanisms against bacteria and fungi and possibly in the assembly of protective lipid layers, such as cutin, on exposed surfaces. Two subfamilies of nsLTPs with a molecular mass of 9 kDa (nsLTP1) and 7 kDa (nsLTP2) have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. These proteins are composed of four alpha-helices stabilized by four disulfide bonds and are resistant to proteolysis, harsh pH changes, and thermal treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. They are able to refold to their native structure on cooling. nsLTPs can survive conditions in the digestive tract as fully IgE-reactive molecules that retain the ability to trigger mast cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The nsLTP1 found in peach is the major peach allergen, Pru p 3, and it is highly resistant to digestion by pepsin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Natural Pru p 3 purified from peach skin is heat stable under acidic conditions, returning to its natural state upon cooling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Natural purified Pru ar 3, an nsLTP1 from apricots, was found to have a resistance of 9 percent to proteolytic degradation when subjected to gastrointestinal digestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. This resistance was much lower than the one found for the peach nsLTP1 (35 percent) and might explain the lower allergenicity of Pru ar 3. Tri a 14, an nsLTP1 from wheat berries, displays high resistance to heat and digestive proteolysis, comparable with that of Pru p 3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The IgE-binding capacity of the corn nsLTP1, Zea m 14, remains unchanged after thermal treatments, even though its secondary structure is altered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Similarly, the cherry nsLTP1, Pru av 3, shows a high resistance to digestion by pepsin, and its IgE reactivity is not diminished after thermal processing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Heat stability has also been reported for the allergenic nsLTP1, Cor a 8, from hazelnut [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Api g 6, an nsLTP2 from celery tuber, represents the first well-characterized allergen from the second subfamily of nsLTPs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Api g 6 was shown to possess a very high thermal stability (Tm &gt;90&deg;C) and high resistance to gastrointestinal digestion. The nsLTP1 from durum wheat (<em>Triticum durum</em>) was shown to be highly resistant to gastroduodenal hydrolysis when cooked durum wheat pasta was digested using a harmonized in vitro static model of oral-gastro-duodenal digestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Alpha-amylase/trypsin</span> inhibitors (AATI) &mdash; AATIs are restricted to the seed storage tissues (endosperm) of cereal grasses. This family of inhibitors, which includes trypsin inhibitors, alpha-amylase inhibitors, and bifunctional <span class=\"nowrap\">trypsin/alpha-amylase</span> inhibitors, is mainly active against digestive enzymes of insects that feed on stored cereal grains. AATIs consist of four to five alpha-helices and a short antiparallel beta sheet tightly held together by four to five intrachain disulfide bridges. AATIs have the capacity not only to sensitize by inhalation but also by ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. AATIs from wheat have been identified as strong activators of innate immune responses in monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells by engaging the TLR4-MD2-CD14 (Toll-like receptor 4, myeloid differentiation protein <span class=\"nowrap\">2/lymphocyte</span> antigen 86, and cluster of differentiation 14) complex and eliciting proinflammatory cytokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">IgE epitopes of the wheat AATI 0.19 (Tri a 28) were detectable after up to 120 minutes of simulated gastric fluid digestion in emulsifying conditions. Intramolecular disulfide bonds and, in particular, emulsification were found to be crucial factors for protein stability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Thaumatin-like proteins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TLPs belong to the family five of pathogenesis-related proteins. TLPs are involved in the resistance and response to fungal pathogens by inhibiting hyphal growth. The conformation of TLPs is stabilized by eight disulfide bonds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. This extensive disulfide cross-linking renders zeamatin, a TLP from corn, highly resistant to proteolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Allergenic TLPs have been identified in various fruits, including apple [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>], cherry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>], kiwi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>], grape [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>], peach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>], lettuce [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>], and sapodilla plum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. TLPs are produced by the grape plant during the ripening of the berry. They persist during the entire vinification process and are among the major proteins present in wine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Mal d 2, the TLP from apple, possesses remarkable stability to proteolysis and thermal treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. The allergen retains its full IgE-binding capacity after two hours each of gastric and duodenal digestion. The heat-induced denaturation of the allergenic TLP from kiwi fruit, Act d 2, under acidic conditions is fully reversible, and IgE binding to this allergen is detectable in processed food products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Ole e 13, the TLP from raw olives, loses its allergenicity due to the routine, prolonged maceration treatment of raw olives with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. This finding offers an explanation as to why there are only a low number of patients who are allergic to this highly consumed fruit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Chitinases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chitinases form a large group of enzymes that degrade the polymer chitin, a structural component of insect exoskeletons and fungal cell walls. Although there are at least five structural classes of chitinases, class I contains most of the chitinases identified as allergens in plants and plant foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Class I chitinases possess an N-terminal cysteine-rich domain. This highly conserved so-called hevein domain binds chitin and is stabilized by four disulfide bridges. The main IgE-binding epitopes are located in this domain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Pers a 1, the allergenic class I chitinase from avocado, retains its ability to produce positive skin prick tests after gastric digestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Other allergens with disulfide bonds</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The allergenic soybean, Kunitz trypsin inhibitor, is resistant to thermal and proteolytic denaturation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Kiwellin (Act d 5) is an important kiwi allergen that contains an N-terminal cysteine-rich domain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. It is one of the three most abundant proteins present in kiwi fruit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Glycosylation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>N-glycosylation is a major modification of proteins in plant cells that occurs during their passage through the endoplasmic reticulum. Glycosylation affects the biologic properties of proteins. The correct glycosylation of proteins plays a pivotal role in their folding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>] and increases their thermal and proteolytic stability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/66-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-68</a>].</p><p>The immunologic activity and relevance of IgE antibodies directed to carbohydrate epitopes has been a matter of debate since the discovery of N-glycan-specific IgE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Approximately 20 percent or more of allergic patients generate specific antiglycan IgE. Although IgE-binding glycoproteins are widespread in pollens, foods, and insect venoms, their cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants (CCDs) do not appear to cause clinical symptoms in most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. One exception is the oligosaccharide galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose (alpha-gal). Alpha-gal-specific IgE antibodies bind to a variety of mammalian allergens and are associated with delayed anaphylaxis after eating mammalian meat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/71-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">71-74</a>].</p><p>The 7S seed storage globulins are frequently glycosylated, with one or two N-linked glycosylation sites located in the C-terminal domain. Soybean Gly m 5 is an allergenic seed storage protein that consists of homo- and heterotrimers of three subunits, namely alpha, alpha', and beta. All three individual subunits are glycosylated on all potential glycosylation sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. In simulated gastrointestinal digestion assays, deglycosylated Gly m 5 was completely degraded, while alpha and beta subunits of the Gly m 5 glycoprotein partially survived the process of digestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. The allergen Ara h 1, the 7S globulin of peanut, possesses one consensus N-glycosylation site. The glycan moieties attached to Ara h 1 are a heterogeneous mixture of N-glycans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Vicilin (Pis s 1) and convicilin (Pis s 2), both 7S globulins, are potential major allergens from pea seeds. Proteolytic fragments from vicilin are relevant IgE-binding pea components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. N-glycosylation of the 7S globulin of pea increases its stability and resistance to chemical denaturation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p>The carbohydrate moiety of Act d 2, a clinically relevant allergenic TLP from kiwi, was shown to play a significant role in the sensitization process by activating antigen-presenting cells and triggering a proinflammatory response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Once the allergy is established, symptoms are primarily induced by the protein portion of the allergen, and involvement of the N-glycan portion is negligible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Intrinsically disordered proteins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IDPs are a class of functional proteins or protein regions that contain smaller or larger highly dynamic fragments. Some proteins are even characterized by a complete lack of ordered structure under physiologic conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. IDPs have been called many names in the past, among them the term &quot;rheomorphic proteins&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/82,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">82,83</a>]. Such proteins are dynamic. They adopt various secondary structures that are in equilibrium with each other. They resemble unfolded, denatured, or partially folded proteins. Consequently, rheomorphic proteins do not undergo sharp transitions from one conformational state to another on heating and thus possess many potential thermostable epitopes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].</p><p>The term &quot;rheomorphic&quot; was first used to describe caseins, major cow's milk allergens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/83,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,85</a>]. Another group of IDPs are the cereal seed storage prolamins. These proteins possess remnants of the original conserved cysteine skeleton of the prolamin superfamily that has been disrupted by the insertion of a central domain consisting of repeated sequences of varying lengths, depending on the type of cereal prolamin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. These repetitive sequences adopt rapidly interconverting beta-turn and beta-sheet secondary structures that tend to form aggregates linked by intermolecular beta sheets. The formation of such structures renders the seed storage prolamins rather insoluble, although they are hydrophilic and bind water avidly. Cereal prolamins do not possess a compact globular structure and thus do not undergo a distinct transition from a native to denatured state when exposed to heat.

Such interactions may increase allergen uptake in the gastrointestinal tract. These associations may also delay or inhibit proteolytic degradation of allergens because the sections of protein embedded in the lipid structure are no longer accessible to proteases. In addition, the interaction of food allergens with the membranes of intestinal epithelial cells may regulate epithelial gene expression to promote allergic sensitization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">2S albumins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>2S albumins function primarily as seed storage proteins.

This ability to affect membrane permeability also may play a role in gastrointestinal processing.</p><p>The allergenic 2S albumin from mustard interacts with phospholipid vesicles, causing both vesicle aggregation, mixing of lipids between vesicles, and vesicle leakage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. The extracellular leaflet of intestinal brush border membranes contains greater amounts of acidic phospholipid bilayers compared with other plasma membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. Interactions with these lipid bilayers may affect the uptake and processing of 2S albumin allergens in the gastrointestinal tract, increasing their allergenic potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].</p><p>Sunflower albumin-8 (SFA-8), an allergenic 2S albumin of sunflower seeds, is known for its emulsification properties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/92,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">92,93</a>]. The 2S albumin allergens from sesame seeds (Ses i 1) and Brazil nuts (Ber e 1) can penetrate intestinal epithelial layers intact and sensitize the mucosal immune system or elicit an allergic response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].

They bind water, cations, fatty acids, hormones, bilirubin, and drugs. Their main function is to regulate the colloidal osmotic pressure of blood. Bovine alpha-lactalbumin, although present in milk in low quantities, is an important cow's milk allergen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. Interactions between alpha-lactalbumin and phosphatidylcholine, a surfactant that is abundant in milk and is actively secreted by the stomach, slow the breakdown of the allergen during in vitro digestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonspecific lipid transfer proteins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonspecific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs) are also able to interact with lipid structures. This ability is implicit in their function to transfer lipids between donor and acceptor vesicles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. An nsLTP from wheat inserts into lipid monolayers, which is a simplified model of biologic membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. Wheat nsLTP can bind two single chain lipids, suggesting that this protein may even form bridges between lipid structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. Although the nsLTP from sunflower seeds is unable to stabilize an emulsion due to the rapid coalescence of oil droplets, it was shown to absorb at air-oil interfaces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. The physiologic importance of these molecular properties might be the ability to interact with epithelial cell membranes to induce proallergenic cytokine production and to enable the allergen to cross the intestinal monolayer followed by the uptake by mucosal dendritic cells. Pru p 3, the peach nsLTP1, was able to cross an epithelial cell monolayer without disturbing the integrity of the tight junctions, indicating an active transport of the allergen following its contact with cell membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Thaumatin-like proteins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many thaumatin-like proteins (TLPs) have been reported to inhibit the growth of fungal hyphae, including the apple allergen Mal d 2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>] and the allergenic TLP from banana [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. The precise mechanism of this biologic activity is not clear, but it may result from permeabilization of fungal membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/103,104\" class=\"abstract_t\">103,104</a>]. TLPs may also interact directly with the lipid bilayer of the fungal plasma membrane. This lipid bilayer is composed of sphingolipids, phospholipids, and sterols that occur in membranes of all living organisms. The membrane permeabilizing activity of linusitin, an antifungal TLP from flax seeds, depends upon membrane composition and is amplified by increased content of negatively charged phospholipids and the presence of sterols [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">PR-10 proteins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major birch pollen allergen, Bet v 1, is a member of the ubiquitous pathogenesis-related (PR)-10 family of proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>]. Bet v 1-related allergens are found in a wide range of plant foods and generally cause only mild oral symptoms. However, there are reports of severe and anaphylactic reactions caused by Bet v 1-related allergens, such as Gly m 4 from soybean [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/107,108\" class=\"abstract_t\">107,108</a>]. The binding of Bet v 1 to membranes induces major structural rearrangements in the molecule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>]. This capability might provide a mechanism by which PR-10 proteins present in foods and, still intact in the digestive tract, cross the mucosal lining and become internalized, thereby facilitating an allergic reaction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">LIGAND BINDING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain food allergens are able to bind nonallergenic organic compounds or ions as ligands, including glucocorticoids and a variety of lipid molecules. Ligand binding increases the stability of an allergen, thus enhancing its allergenic potential. Several major food allergens bind lipid ligands in hydrophobic cavities or by hydrophobic interactions. These allergens include members of the 2S albumins, nonspecific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs), and lipocalin families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. It is thought that the formation of additional hydrogen bonds between the ligand and the protein stabilizes the protein scaffold, increases its rigidity, and decreases its susceptibility to proteolysis. In addition, dietary lipids can act as adjuvants and might skew the immune response towards a T helper cell type 2 (Th2) phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>].</p><p>Ionic ligands, such as metal ions, become part of the structure of a protein and are often deeply buried within the molecule. Ligand binding often results in reduced mobility of the polypeptide backbone. This leads to a decreased susceptibility to thermal and proteolytic denaturation since many proteases require a certain flexibility of the substrate protein. The loss of a metal ion often disrupts the protein folding and leads to an increase in protein mobility and, in some instances, to a transition to a partially folded form. Some proteins possess a cavity or a tunnel into which the ligand fits, and others bind ligands through surface interactions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonspecific lipid transfer proteins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>nsLTPs are able to bind lipid molecules in a tunnel that runs through the entire protein and is lined with hydrophobic residues. The size of the tunnel varies for different nsLTPs.</p><p>Barley and wheat nsLTPs are able to bind a variety of fatty acids and phospholipids of differing lengths with high affinity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/111,112\" class=\"abstract_t\">111,112</a>]. Wheat nsLTP can bind a wide range of lipophilic molecules, including sphingolipids, prostaglandin, amphotericin B, and other hydrophobic drugs, due to the high plasticity of the hydrophobic cavity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/113,114\" class=\"abstract_t\">113,114</a>]. Barley nsLTP can accommodate two lipid molecules, lying side by side within the tunnel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]. Disulfide bridges are essential for the existence of the cavity, whereas its plasticity depends upon both the hydrophobic residues lining the cavity and the C-terminal flexibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>].</p><p>Structural features and ligand binding are both directly related to nsLTP stability. Grape nsLTP is unaltered after gastric digestion, and a C-terminally trimmed fragment is produced by duodenal digestion. This fragment has the same in vitro and in vivo immunoglobulin E (IgE) reactivity as the intact protein. Inclusion of phosphatidylcholine protected the nsLTP to a limited extent against digestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>]. In contrast to the results obtained for grape nsLTP1, it was reported that the susceptibility of Tri a 14, the wheat nsLTP1, to proteolytic cleavage increased significantly upon lipid binding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H391726742\"><span class=\"h2\">2S albumins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The 2S albumin from Brazil nut, Ber e 1, has a potential lipid-binding cavity the same size as is seen in some nsLTPs.

The EF-hand motif consists of a 12-residue loop flanked on both sides by 12 residue alpha-helical domains. Parvalbumins possess three such EF-hand motifs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>], two of which are capable of binding calcium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>]. A mutated carp parvalbumin, mCyp c 1, was created by destroying the calcium binding sites, thereby rendering the molecule hypoallergenic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>].</p><p>Parvalbumins can be subdivided into two distinct evolutionary lineages, alpha- and beta-parvalbumins, although their overall folds are very similar. Beta-parvalbumins are present in the white muscle of many fish species in relative high amounts and are generally allergenic. Loss of parvalbumin-bound calcium triggers large conformational changes and an associated loss of conformation-dependent IgE epitopes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/122-124\" class=\"abstract_t\">122-124</a>]. Parvalbumins show a remarkable resistance to heat, denaturing chemicals, and proteases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>].

Beta-lactoglobulin, Bos d 5, the major whey protein in milk of ruminants and many other mammals, is a cow's milk allergen that belongs to the lipocalin superfamily. It binds a diverse range of molecules, including retinol and its analogues, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-carotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">beta-carotene</a>, saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, and aliphatic hydrocarbons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/128\" class=\"abstract_t\">128</a>].</p><p>The relative resistance of beta-lactoglobulin to acid hydrolysis and protease degradation allows some of the protein to remain intact after digestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/129\" class=\"abstract_t\">129</a>].

Both 7S and 11S globulins are stable to heating. The cupin barrel is thought to remain intact with heat exposure. Unfolding of other regions through heating results in a loss of quaternary structure along with concomitant formation of large aggregates.

The process, also called the Maillard reaction, involves sugars reacting with free amino groups on proteins to form Amadori compounds. These compounds may then rearrange to produce a range of adducts known as advanced glycation end products (AGE). AGEs are common nonenzymatic chemical modifications of food proteins. AGEs form during thermal processing, particularly during the application of dry heating procedures such as roasting. They also slowly form over days and months as a consequence of the aging process of foods. Dendritic cells recognize AGE-modified proteins via the receptor for AGE (RAGE). Dendritic cells stimulated with AGE-modified proteins activated more interleukin-4 (IL-4)-producing T cells than interferon-gamma (INF-gamma)-producing T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-features-of-food-allergens/abstract/139\" class=\"abstract_t\">139</a>].</p><p>Heating in either wet (eg, boiling) or dry processes (eg, frying) can denature <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> modify proteins.
