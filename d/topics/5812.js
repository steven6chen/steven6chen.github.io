It is the convulsive manifestation of preeclampsia and one of several clinical manifestations at the severe end of the preeclampsia spectrum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76975\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76975 \">table 1</a>). Despite advances in detection and management, <span class=\"nowrap\">preeclampsia/eclampsia</span> remains a common cause of maternal morbidity and death.</p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of eclampsia will be reviewed here.

The incidence of eclampsia has been stable at 1.5 to 10 cases per 10,000 deliveries in developed countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eclampsia/abstract/2-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-8</a>]. In developing countries, however, the incidence varies widely: from 6 to 157 cases per 10,000 deliveries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eclampsia/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].</p><p>Risk factors for eclampsia are similar to those for preeclampsia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F61266\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61266 \">table 2</a>). Women at highest risk of developing eclampsia are nonwhite, nulliparous, and from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. The peak incidence is in adolescence and the early twenties but is also increased in women over age 35.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS OF SEIZURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The precise cause of seizures in preeclamptic women is not clearly understood. Two models have been proposed, based on the central role of hypertension. According to the first model, hypertension causes a breakdown of the autoregulatory system of the cerebral circulation, leading to hyperperfusion, endothelial dysfunction, and vasogenic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cytotoxic edema. In the second model, hypertension causes activation of the autoregulatory system, leading to vasoconstriction of cerebral vessels leading to hypoperfusion, localized ischemia, endothelial dysfunction, and vasogenic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cytotoxic edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eclampsia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Cerebral inflammation may also play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eclampsia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The pathogenesis of preeclampsia is reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women have premonitory <span class=\"nowrap\">signs/symptoms</span> in the hours before the initial seizure. In a systematic review including 59 studies involving over 21,000 women with eclampsia from 26 countries, the most common antecedent <span class=\"nowrap\">signs/symptoms</span> and percent of women with the <span class=\"nowrap\">sign/symptom</span> were [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eclampsia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertension (75 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache (persistent frontal or occipital headaches or thunderclap headaches) (66 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Visual disturbances (scotomata, loss of vision [cortical blindness], blurred vision, diplopia, visual field defects [eg, homonymous hemianopsia], photophobia) (27 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Right upper quadrant or epigastric pain (25 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymptomatic (25 percent)</p><p/><p>Ankle clonus is also a common finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eclampsia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Eclampsia is generally manifested by a generalized tonic-clonic seizure or coma. At onset, there is an abrupt loss of consciousness, often associated with a scream or shriek. The muscles of the arms, legs, chest, and back then become stiff. The woman may begin to appear cyanotic during this tonic phase. After approximately one minute, the muscles begin to jerk and twitch for an additional one to two minutes. During this clonic phase, the tongue may be bitten and frothy and bloody sputum may come out of the mouth. The postictal phase begins once the twitching movements end. The woman is initially in a deep sleep, breathing deeply, and then gradually wakes up, often complaining of a headache (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F54942\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54942 \">table 3</a>). Most patients begin to recover responsiveness within 10 to 20 minutes after the generalized convulsion. Focal neurologic deficits are generally absent. </p><p>Fetal bradycardia for at least three to five minutes is a common finding during and immediately after the seizure. Resolution of maternal seizure activity is associated with fetal tachycardia and loss of heart rate variability, sometimes with transient decelerations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eclampsia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The fetal heart rate pattern generally improves with maternal and fetal therapeutic interventions (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below). A nonreassuring pattern with frequent, recurrent decelerations for more than 10 to 15 minutes despite maternal and fetal resuscitative interventions suggests the possibility of an occult abruption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eclampsia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>On physical examination, neurologic findings may include memory deficits, increased deep tendon reflexes, visual perception deficits, visual processing deficits, altered mental status, and cranial nerve deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eclampsia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9073098\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Eclampsia occurs preterm in approximately 50 percent of women and between 20 and 30 weeks of gestation in approximately 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eclampsia/abstract/2,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,19</a>]. In the systematic review described above, 59 percent of eclampsia occurred antepartum, 20 percent occurred intrapartum, and 21 percent occurred postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eclampsia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Approximately 90 percent of postpartum seizures occur within one week of delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eclampsia/abstract/20-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-24</a>]. Antecedent symptoms were similar to those with antepartum and intrapartum eclampsia. In a series of women discharged and later readmitted with eclampsia more than two days but less than six weeks after delivery, the most common presenting symptom was headache, which occurred in about 70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eclampsia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Other prodromal symptoms included shortness of breath, blurry vision, nausea or vomiting, edema, neurological deficit, and epigastric pain.

The most common findings of RPLS on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are patchy <span class=\"nowrap\">T2/FLAIR</span> hyperintensity in the subcortical white matter and adjacent gray matter of the parietal and occipital lobes.

In this series, &gt;50 percent of women who died within two days of seizures had cerebral hemorrhages. Petechial cortical hemorrhages were most common, especially involving the occipital lobe. Diffuse cerebral edema and gross hemorrhage occurred less frequently. Cerebral venous thrombosis was common in women who developed eclampsia postpartum.</p><p>A more contemporary series (2003 to 2006) of over 300 maternal deaths in Mozambique reported the following types and frequencies of brain lesions: perivascular edema (68 percent), hemorrhage (37 percent), hemosiderin (32 percent), parenchymal necrosis (16 percent), and small vessel thrombosis (11 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eclampsia/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Endothelial, histiocytic, and platelet markers suggested capillary injury in the otherwise intact brain parenchyma, while stains for free radical formation were positive mostly in areas of tissue injury, with focal positivity in intact <span class=\"nowrap\">glial/neuronal</span> elements.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H840972135\"><span class=\"h3\">Electroencephalography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is limited information on electroencephalography (EEG) in eclampsia.

The following issues should be considered in differential diagnosis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The occurrence of <span class=\"nowrap\">preeclampsia/eclampsia</span> before 20 weeks of gestation is rare and should raise the possibility of an underlying molar pregnancy or a cause of seizure unrelated to pregnancy.

History, physical examination, and laboratory studies can help distinguish these disorders from eclampsia. Laboratory tests appropriate for the evaluation of a first seizure include electrolytes, glucose, calcium, magnesium, hematology studies, renal function tests, liver function tests, and toxicology screens, although the likelihood of finding a relevant abnormality in unselected patients is low. The absence of neurologic deficits does not exclude an anatomic abnormality within the brain. Neuroimaging when the patient is clinically stable may be valuable in select cases.

A common threshold for initiating antihypertensive therapy is sustained diastolic pressures greater than 105 to 110 mmHg or systolic blood pressures &ge;160 mmHg, although the validity of these thresholds has not been tested prospectively. The risk of stroke correlates with the degree of elevation in systolic and diastolic pressures and maternal age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eclampsia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], but it is not clear whether there is a threshold pressure above which emergent therapy should be started in pregnant hypertensive women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eclampsia/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The cerebral vasculature of women with underlying chronic hypertension can probably tolerate higher systolic pressures without injury, while adolescents with normally low blood pressures may benefit from starting treatment at lower blood pressure levels. </p><p>The indications for treatment of hypertension, drug choice and dose, and target blood pressure are the same as in preeclampsia and reviewed in detail separately.

In one review of 179 consecutive cases of eclampsia, factors identified to be at least partially responsible for failure to prevent seizures were: physician error (36 percent), lack of prenatal care (19 percent), abrupt onset (18 percent), magnesium failure (13 percent), late postpartum onset (12 percent), and early onset before 21 weeks (3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eclampsia/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. </p><p>The majority of eclamptic women have one or more antecedent symptoms in the hours prior to an eclamptic seizure, thus pregnant women should be educated to call their healthcare provider if these symptoms develop (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation and findings'</a> above). However, up to 40 percent of eclamptic seizures are not preceded by premonitory signs and symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eclampsia/abstract/2,73-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,73-76</a>].</p><p>The relationship between hypertension, signs and symptoms of cortical irritability (eg, headache that is usually severe or persistent, visual disturbances, nausea, vomiting, fever, hyperreflexia) and seizures remains unclear. The magnitude of blood pressure elevation does not appear to be predictive of eclampsia, although it correlates well with the incidence of stroke (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F66793\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66793 \">figure 1</a>). Twenty to 38 percent of eclamptic patients have a maximal blood pressure less than <span class=\"nowrap\">140/90</span> prior to their seizure and about 20 percent have no evidence of proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eclampsia/abstract/2,58,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,58,60</a>]. While antihypertensive treatment is recommended in women with blood pressures <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;160/105</span> to 110 mmHg, the use of antihypertensive drugs to control mildly elevated blood pressure in the setting of <span class=\"nowrap\">preeclampsia/eclampsia</span> does not alter the course of the disease or diminish perinatal morbidity or mortality. Pharmacologic treatment of mild hypertension is not recommended, as neither maternal nor fetal benefits have been demonstrated.

(See <a href=\"#H379681801\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An eclamptic seizure occurs in 2 to 3 percent of women with severe features of preeclampsia who are not receiving anti-seizure prophylaxis and between 0 and 0.6 percent in women with preeclampsia without severe features. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Incidence and epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most women have premonitory <span class=\"nowrap\">signs/symptoms</span> in the hours before their initial seizure, such as hypertension and proteinuria, headache, visual disturbances, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> right upper quadrant or epigastric pain. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation and findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eclampsia occurs before term in approximately 50 percent of women. Thirty-eight to 55 percent of eclampsia occurs antepartum, 13 to 36 percent occurs intrapartum, 5 to 39 percent occurs &le;48 hours postpartum, and 5 to 17 percent occurs &gt;48 hours postpartum. Approximately 90 percent of postpartum seizures occur within one week of delivery. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation and findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetal bradycardia lasting at least three to five minutes is a common finding during and immediately after an eclamptic seizure. Emergent cesarean delivery is not needed unless the fetal heart rate tracing does not improve within 10 to 15 minutes of maternal and fetal resuscitative interventions. (See <a href=\"#H15375969\" class=\"local\">'Fetal resuscitation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Key management issues are: prevention of maternal hypoxia and trauma, treatment of severe hypertension (if present), prevention of recurrent seizures with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium sulfate</a>, and evaluation for prompt delivery. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Key principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with eclampsia, we recommend treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium sulfate</a> rather than other anticonvulsants (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a>, magnesium sulfate reduces the rate of recurrent seizures by one-half to two-thirds and reduces the rate of maternal death by one-third. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of recurrent seizures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest using an intravascular <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium sulfate</a> regimen rather than an intramuscular regimen (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We use a 6 gram loading dose over 15 to 20 minutes, followed by 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">grams/hour</span> as a continuous intravenous infusion. Loading doses of 4 or 5 grams are also reasonable and a lower or higher maintenance dose (1 or 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/hour)</span> is sometimes required.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The maintenance phase is given only if a patellar reflex is present (loss of deep tendon reflexes is the first manifestation of symptomatic hypermagnesemia), respirations are greater than 12 per minute, and urine output is over 100 mL in four hours. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The loading dose may be given safely in renal insufficiency, but the maintenance dose in these patients should be omitted or reduced in consultation with a nephrologist or pharmacologist. Magnesium levels should be monitored in patients with renal insufficiency. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Administration of magnesium sulfate'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A common threshold for initiating antihypertensive therapy is sustained diastolic pressures greater than 105 to 110 mmHg or systolic blood pressures &ge;160 mmHg. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of hypertension'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delivery is the only curative treatment, but this does not preclude induction of labor. Cesarean delivery is a reasonable option for women less than 32 to 34 weeks of gestation with an unfavorable cervix. After a seizure, in the absence of fetal bradycardia, we suggest waiting 15 to 20 minutes and until the mother and fetus show signs of recovery (control of seizures; mother oriented to name, time, and place; fetal heart rate reassuring) before proceeding to surgery, if possible. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for prompt delivery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizures due to eclampsia always resolve postpartum, generally within a few hours to days. Diuresis (greater than 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/day)</span> is believed to be the most accurate clinical indicator of resolution of <span class=\"nowrap\">preeclampsia/eclampsia</span> but is not a guarantee against the development of seizures. When begun before delivery, we continue <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium sulfate</a> for 24 to 48 hours postpartum. When begun for postpartum eclampsia, we maintain therapy for 24 to 48 hours. (See <a href=\"#H103234656\" class=\"local\">'Duration of magnesium sulfate therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of recurrent eclampsia in a future pregnancy is 2 percent. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Recurrence risk'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to <span class=\"nowrap\">preeclampsia/eclampsia,</span> women with a history of severe <span class=\"nowrap\">preeclampsia/eclampsia</span> are at increased risk of obstetric complications in subsequent pregnancies. They are also at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and diabetes later in life. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Long-term maternal health'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eclampsia may not be preventable when of abrupt onset, onset early in pregnancy, or onset after postpartum hospital discharge. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Can eclampsia be predicted and prevented?'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eclampsia/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Sibai BM.
