It is characterized by severe periodic episodes of headache accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia, and relieved with sleep. In children, it may last from 2 to 72 hours (sometimes shorter), is often bilateral, and often occurs without aura [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-treatment-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The management of migraine consists of general lifestyle measures, abortive treatment, and preventive treatment. An individual patient may need all three approaches. Unfortunately, there are limited data from controlled, randomized, and blinded trials regarding treatment of migraine in children and adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-treatment-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Thus, most management recommendations are based upon experience in adults.</p><p>The preventive treatment of migraine in children is reviewed here. Other aspects of pediatric migraine are discussed separately.

Literature describing migraine in children should be provided (see <a href=\"#H1122614117\" class=\"local\">'Information for patients'</a> below). The family should be asked to document the occurrence of headaches on a calendar or diary to identify possible triggering factors, clarify features of the attacks, and to help evaluate the effectiveness of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-treatment-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A headache diary suitable for children can be downloaded from <a href=\"http://www.childrenshospital.org/~/media/healthtopics-kidsmd/conditions/headaches/hadiary.ashx?la=en&amp;token=JiTJIKzni6Vw8R2BTB/kglnSMc1cFToWaABUTp7bFXd1TzXjB3XPuOM/fl28pvcdTURj6JPpCt6yQnzREeJholY0f2CxWf8PrkqQEQj0+8KU12LX8L1PyoDd2YtiOEto&amp;TOPIC_ID=98355\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Boston Children&rsquo;s Hospital</a>.</p><p>Precipitating factors for migraine should be identified when possible. Sleep disturbances, such as insomnia, snoring, or frequent awakenings, may worsen headache frequency. Dehydration and missing meals are possible precipitants of migraine. Migraines occur more often during the school year, and a school history should be explored in the child with frequent migraines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-treatment-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Rarely, a temporal relationship is established between diet and headache. Many young women will notice a migraine prior to their menstrual period.

Unfortunately, there are few high-quality pediatric data to guide us as to the most efficacious or safest choice in children.

As examples, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">amitriptyline</a> may be used to treat migraine for children with depression (see <a href=\"#H534630917\" class=\"local\">'Amitriptyline'</a> below), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topiramate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">topiramate</a> for children with obesity or epilepsy (see <a href=\"#H1122613199\" class=\"local\">'Topiramate'</a> below), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">valproate</a> for children (mainly boys) with epilepsy (see <a href=\"#H1036150375\" class=\"local\">'Valproate'</a> below). Because of its side effect profile, valproate is generally avoided in children with obesity or girls of child-bearing age. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Propranolol</a> should be used with care in children with asthma, diabetes, or depression.</p><p>Most preventive medications are started at a low dose and gradually titrated up until therapeutic benefit develops, the maximum dose is reached, or significant side effects intervene. The chosen medication should be given an adequate trial in terms of dose and duration; one to three months may be required before adequate benefit is reached. Children who are intolerant of the initial drug or have an unsatisfactory response despite an adequate trial can be switched to a different agent. </p><p>The family should understand the rationale, dosing, duration, and side effects of a particular treatment. Preventive migraine therapy requires a sustained commitment on the part of the family and practitioner to achieve benefit. Partly due to these reasons, parents of younger children frequently prefer symptomatic treatment to administering daily preventive medication. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-treatment-of-migraine-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute treatment of migraine in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The optimum duration of preventive drug treatment is uncertain. Our approach is to continue to treat for 6 to 12 months if headaches are well controlled. We then taper the drug over the course of several weeks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H534630498\"><span class=\"h2\">Cyproheptadine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyproheptadine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Cyproheptadine</a> is an antihistamine and serotonin antagonist with anticholinergic and calcium channel blocking properties that is used for migraine prevention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-treatment-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/4,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9,10</a>]. Cyproheptadine (2 to 16 mg daily given at bedtime) is given as an oral syrup or tablet for migraine prevention. Clinical experience suggests that a single dose at bedtime helps to avoid daytime sleepiness and appears to be as effective as two or three daytime doses.</p><p>Data for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyproheptadine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cyproheptadine</a> are limited to a few small retrospective studies. One was a study of 126 children and adolescents who received various preventive treatments for migraine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-treatment-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. A positive response, defined as an overall decrease in headache frequency and intensity plus acceptability of the agent, occurred with cyproheptadine in 25 of 30 (83 percent) children. Headache frequency decreased with cyproheptadine (2 to 8 mg daily) from 8.4 to 3.7 headaches per month. In an earlier retrospective review of 12 children with abdominal migraine treated with preventive cyproheptadine, pain ceased in four, became milder and less frequent in six, and had no effect in two [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-treatment-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Appetite stimulation with weight gain is a common side effect and tends to limit use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyproheptadine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cyproheptadine</a> in older children.

Propranolol is started at 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day in three divided doses, and can be titrated up as needed to a maximum daily dose of 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span>. Heart rate and orthostatic blood pressure should be monitored every three months or after increasing the dose. The heart rate should be &gt;60 beats per minute (bpm) after one minute of exercise. This drug often is discontinued by children who participate in strenuous physical activities. A long-acting form of propranolol is available for once-a-day dosing. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Atenolol</a> can be an economical alternative for once daily dosing.</p><p>However, few placebo-controlled trials have evaluated beta blockers for migraine prevention in children, and the available evidence is conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-treatment-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/3,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,8</a>], although dosing schedules have not been evaluated systematically. In a double-blind crossover trial of 39 children, the frequency, severity, and duration of headaches were similar with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">propranolol</a> and placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-treatment-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In another report, self-hypnosis was superior to propranolol (3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-treatment-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, in a third study, propranolol (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) provided effective prevention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-treatment-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Propranolol</a> also may be effective for prevention of abdominal migraine (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-migraine-in-children#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of migraine in children&quot;, section on 'Abdominal migraine'</a>).

Clinical experience suggests that a single dose of amitriptyline (0.25 to 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day)</span> given at night often is effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-treatment-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The dose is advanced slowly as needed if headaches persist. The daily dose rarely should exceed 100 mg or 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day. However, the optimal dose of amitriptyline for migraine prevention in children has not been established, and recommended doses vary. In one report, 192 children with more than three headaches per month were treated with amitriptyline in a dose of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-treatment-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with a reduction of &ge;50 percent in the number of headache days, comparing the last 28 days of the trial with the 28-day baseline period. The trial was stopped early due to futility at an interim analysis after enrolling only 361 of the planned 675 subjects; final data were available for only 264 subjects. By intention-to-treat analysis, the proportion of patients who achieved a relative reduction of &ge;50 percent in the number of headache days was similar for the amitriptyline, topiramate, and placebo groups (52, 55, and 61 percent, respectively), and the differences between groups were not statistically significant. Adverse events were more common in the amitriptyline and topiramate groups. The results are in agreement with other data showing that a high placebo response rate seems to be characteristic of pediatric migraine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-treatment-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Amitriptyline</a> may cause anticholinergic effects and will often increase heart rate.
