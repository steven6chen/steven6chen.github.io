Thus, the morbidity associated with endoscopic procedures and contrast materials is avoided. However, MRCP does not permit interventions to be performed such as stone extraction, stent insertion, or biopsy.</p><p>Since the introduction of MRCP in 1991, technological refinements have made it an extremely useful modality in the evaluation of the hepatobiliary tree. The technique was initially performed with the use of heavily T2-weighted magnetic resonance pulse sequences. These had the effect of making stationary or slow-flowing fluid within the bile and pancreatic ducts to appear very bright relative to the low-signal intensity produced by adjacent solid tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-cholangiopancreatography/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. With the specific image acquisition sequences used, flowing blood had little or no measurable signal; as a result, blood vessels were not mistaken for bile or pancreatic ducts. The ducts could be visualized from multiple projections, thereby duplicating cholangiographic images noninvasively.</p><p>However, this method was limited in its ability to detect non-dilated bile ducts because of a low signal-to-noise ratio and sensitivity to motion artifacts. Newer variants of magnetic resonance, including the rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) and half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin-echo (HASTE), provide superior images. Single-shot RARE and HASTE techniques can be performed in a breath-hold period with a scan time of &lt;20 seconds.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H69110225\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging protocols</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal protocol to perform MRCP has not been defined, and there continues to be variation across centers. As a general rule, the protocol depends upon the specific magnetic resonance magnet being used, including its field strength (eg, 1.5 versus 3T) and the manufacturer, as well as institutional experience and preferences. However, all acquisition protocols obtain heavily T2-weighted images as thick slabs, and the images are reformatted in planes to optimize depiction of the extrahepatic ducts. Volume-rendered images may be used to depict the intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts.</p><p>A newer technique to minimize signal from the stomach and duodenum, and thus increase the visibility of the biliary tree, has been the administration of a single dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranitidine</a> 300 mg two to three hours prior to the study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-cholangiopancreatography/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In addition, one report found that intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glucagon</a> improved visualization of the common bile duct and ampulla of Vater during MRCP without any documented adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-cholangiopancreatography/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H69110231\"><span class=\"h2\">Contrast agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With the increasingly widespread adoption of the use of hepatocellular contrast agents, functional MRCP is an option for a variety of clinical indications. Hepatocellular contrast agents are partially excreted through the hepatobiliary system, allowing for the imaging of the transit of the hyperintense contrast agent through the biliary tree and into the duodenum. Burgeoning applications of functional MRCP include preoperative biliary mapping and detection of bile leaks, as well as the functional assessment of biliary obstruction and acute cholecystitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-cholangiopancreatography/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Limitations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main potential problems with MRCP are image artifacts and difficulty in patient compliance. Image artifacts can be produced by a bright signal arising from stationary fluid within the adjacent duodenum, duodenal diverticula, and ascitic fluid. In addition, local areas of signal dropout can be caused by metallic clips placed during cholecystectomy, crossing defects induced by the right hepatic artery, or from severely narrowed ducts (eg, in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis). The presence of metal leads or fragments precludes any magnetic resonance imaging study. Other problems that can erroneously suggest common bile duct obstruction or common bile duct stones are discussed in the appropriate sections below.</p><p>MRCP has lower resolution than direct cholangiography and can miss small stones (&lt;4 mm), small ampullary lesions, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and strictures of the ducts. MRCP also has difficulty visualizing small stones in the pancreatic duct. In addition, as will be mentioned below, certain anatomic characteristics or disorders can mimic bile duct obstruction or common bile duct stones. Obstructing stones are generally easier to identify than nonobstructing stones (especially if smaller than the thickness of the acquired image slices). Small stones may not be distinguishable from sludge, mucin, or even blood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL USE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) provides accurate depiction and measurements of the bile and pancreatic ducts in 95 percent of examinations; associated anatomic variants, such as pancreas divisum and choledochal cysts, and pancreatic ductal disruptions can also be visualized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-cholangiopancreatography/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The technique is useful for documenting communication between pancreatic cysts and ducts and for evaluating the nature of pancreatic cysts. However, since it is fluid within ducts that is depicted, MRCP may have difficulty differentiating between focal strictures and spasm of the common bile duct.</p><p>The following sections will briefly describe some of the major clinical uses of MRCP in patients with suspected hepatobiliary disease. The use of MRCP and other imaging studies in the individual disorders is discussed in detail on the appropriate topic reviews.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Bile duct obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MRCP can identify the larger intrahepatic ducts and the extrahepatic ducts in 83 to 100 percent of patients with normal caliber ducts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-cholangiopancreatography/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. It has a greater ability to depict abnormal dilated ducts, and provides a diagnostic cholangiogram in 90 to 100 percent of patients; it also reveals the level of obstruction in 80 to 100 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-cholangiopancreatography/abstract/13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-17</a>] and may have a role in the diagnosis of postcholecystectomy biliary complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-cholangiopancreatography/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A systematic review that included a total of 67 studies found that the overall sensitivity and specificity of MRCP for the diagnosis of biliary obstruction were 95 and 97 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-cholangiopancreatography/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Sensitivity was lower for stones (92 percent) and for malignant conditions (88 percent). In a randomized trial, MRCP had a high sensitivity, but lower specificity for identifying post-transplant biliary strictures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-cholangiopancreatography/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, MRCP is a passive anatomic technique that does not display functional information, such as the degree of obstruction to flow, which can be seen by conventional cholangiography.</p><p>There are some technical pitfalls that can interfere with the interpretation of MRCP in bile duct obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-cholangiopancreatography/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. As an example, low union of the cystic duct with the common hepatic duct with both ducts running in parallel for a significant distance may result in a combined image suggestive of common bile duct dilation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Cholangiocarcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once ductal dilation is established by ultrasonography, the next step has been to fully image the biliary tree via ERCP or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC). These invasive procedures can exclude choledocholithiasis and define the location and extent of the biliary lesion. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) remains preferred in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC; a major predisposing factor to cholangiocarcinoma). Conversely, PTC was formerly preferred to image the more proximal biliary system if complete obstruction of the distal biliary tree is suspected.</p><p>The role of MRCP in the diagnosis and management of bile duct malignancy is not yet defined. It will probably prove to be a useful noninvasive adjunct to present techniques, since it has the capability to evaluate the bile ducts both above and below a stricture while also identifying any intrahepatic mass lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F73964\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73964 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F72880\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72880 \">image 2</a>). One series evaluated MRCP in 126 patients with suspected bile duct obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-cholangiopancreatography/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Fourteen had malignant obstruction that was diagnosed by MRCP in 12; the positive predictive value was 86 percent and the negative predictive value 98 percent (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cholangiocarcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma&quot;</a>). In other reports, MRCP alone had limited specificity in the diagnosis of malignant strictures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-cholangiopancreatography/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Malignant hilar and perihilar obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MRCP appears to be useful in delineating the anatomical extent of perihilar obstruction and interpreting its etiology. One study, for example, included 40 patients with malignant perihilar biliary obstruction who underwent ERCP and MRCP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-cholangiopancreatography/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Both tests were equally effective in detecting the biliary obstruction. However, MRCP was superior in the investigation of the anatomical extent and the type of tumor. Similar conclusions have been reached in other reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-cholangiopancreatography/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with known or suspected PSC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with known or suspected PSC, MRCP is performed along with routine magnetic resonance imaging to document the segmental extent of ductal involvement to help plan for surgery, search for intrahepatic metastases, and identify aberrant ductal anatomy. Routine magnetic resonance images are obtained to document the extent of extrahepatic involvement, including nodes at the porta hepatis.</p><p>Characteristic changes of PSC are visible on MRCP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F69476\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69476 \">image 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-cholangiopancreatography/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>]. However, MRCP provides less spatial resolution than ERCP and lower sensitivity for detecting subtle peripheral ductal abnormalities in the liver. Peripheral ducts may not be visualized because imaging is performed when ducts are in their physiologic, nondistended state. In addition, the subtle mural irregularities see on ERCP may not be detected with MRCP. Furthermore, MRCP does not permit therapeutic intervention. The accuracy of MRCP for diagnosis or screening of cholangiocarcinoma in patients with PSC has not been well established.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Common bile duct stones</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common bile duct (CBD) stones (choledocholithiasis) are readily displayed by MRCP as a signal void within the bright signal arising from bile (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F68692\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68692 \">image 4</a>). Multiple studies have compared test characteristics of MRCP with other imaging modalities in detection of choledocholithiasis. As a general rule, test characteristics of MRCP appear to be similar to ERCP for detecting choledocholithiasis (sensitivity 80 to 100 percent, specificity 85 to 100 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80729\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80729 \">image 5</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-cholangiopancreatography/abstract/14-17,25,29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17,25,29-31</a>]. In an illustrative study (involving 32 patients with suspected biliary pancreatitis), the sensitivity of transabdominal ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), MRCP, ERCP, and intraductal ultrasonography was 20, 40, 80, 90, and 95 percent, respectively, compared with ERCP plus stone extraction as the reference standard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-cholangiopancreatography/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The overall agreement between MRCP and ERCP was 91 percent.</p><p>However, as noted above, test characteristics depend in part upon the imaging techniques, experience, size of the stone, and anatomy surrounding biliary tree. Sensitivity of MRCP decreased with dilated bile ducts (73 percent for a bile duct diameter &gt;10 mm versus 89 percent for small diameter bile ducts) in one of the reports above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-cholangiopancreatography/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In the presence of a dilated CBD, MRCP has a 90 to 95 percent concordance with ERCP in diagnosing CBD stones over 4 mm in diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-cholangiopancreatography/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p>Stones larger than 4 mm are readily seen but cannot be differentiated from filling defects such as blood clots, tumor, sludge, or parasites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-cholangiopancreatography/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Other mimickers of choledocholithiasis include flow artifacts, biliary air, and a pseudostone at the ampulla [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-cholangiopancreatography/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>The choice of procedure varies with the clinical setting and local availability. In patients with cholangitis, for example, ERCP is preferred because it permits therapeutic drainage of the obstruction. However, MRCP may be performed if cholangitis is not severe and the risks of ERCP are high (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-cholangitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute cholangitis&quot;</a>). MRCP may also be useful after unsuccessful or incomplete ERCP and in imaging the CBD in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-cholangiopancreatography/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Endoscopic ultrasound may also be an option in individuals considered at increased risk for ERCP. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-ultrasound-in-patients-with-suspected-choledocholithiasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic ultrasound in patients with suspected choledocholithiasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute cholecystitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of MRCP for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was evaluated in a series that included 35 patients with symptoms of acute cholecystitis who underwent both ultrasound and magnetic resonance cholangiography prior to cholecystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-cholangiopancreatography/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. MRCP was superior to ultrasound for detecting stones in the cystic duct (sensitivity 100 versus 14 percent) but was less sensitive than ultrasound for detecting gallbladder wall thickening (sensitivity 69 versus 96 percent). At the present time its role in the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis should remain within clinical trials. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-cholecystitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute cholecystitis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MRCP has been evaluated in both acute and chronic pancreatitis. In patients with acute pancreatitis, MRCP is useful for evaluating the bile ducts and cystic duct remnants for stones, for evaluating the pancreatic ducts, and for documenting the presence of cysts in or around the pancreas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-cholangiopancreatography/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. However, ERCP is often preferred in patients with gallstone pancreatitis since endoscopic papillotomy performed during the same procedure may be beneficial in patients with obstructive jaundice (with a serum bilirubin concentration above 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> or biliary sepsis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-pancreatitis#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute pancreatitis&quot;, section on 'Gallstone pancreatitis'</a>). In patients with failed ERCP and in those with biliary-enteric anastomoses with which ERCP may be contraindicated, MRCP can be used to image the ducts and evaluate the anastomosis, respectively.</p><p>MRCP can also detect pancreas divisum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-cholangiopancreatography/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, the possible association of this variant with the development of either acute or chronic pancreatitis remains controversial. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of acute pancreatitis&quot;, section on 'Pancreas divisum'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and pathogenesis of chronic pancreatitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>MRCP appears to be as accurate as ERCP for distinguishing pancreatic cancer from chronic pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-cholangiopancreatography/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. This was illustrated in a prospective study involving 124 patients who were suspected of having pancreatic cancer and underwent a number of diagnostic studies, including ERCP and MRCP. The correct diagnosis was confirmed histologically and clinically. A diagnosis of pancreatic cancer was established in 37 patients (30 percent); the others had chronic pancreatitis (46 percent) or other causes. The sensitivity and specificity of MRCP for diagnosing pancreatic cancer were 84 and 97 percent, which was similar to ERCP 70 and 94 percent, respectively.</p><p>MRCP has also been used for surveillance in patients with mutations that predispose to pancreatic cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-cholangiopancreatography/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In a study of 79 patients with a p16-Leiden mutation who were followed for a median of four years, pancreatic cancer was detected in seven patients (9 percent). Possible cancer precursors were detected in an additional nine patients (11 percent). All of the patients with pancreatic cancer had resectable lesions.</p><p>MRCP may have advantages compared with ERCP in specific settings, such as in patients who have gastric outlet or duodenal stenosis or who have had surgical rearrangement (eg, Billroth II) or ductal disruption, resulting in ducts which cannot be assessed by ERCP (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis in adults&quot;</a>). It can also be used to detect bile duct obstruction occurring as a complication of chronic pancreatitis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-complications-of-chronic-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the complications of chronic pancreatitis&quot;</a>). Post-ERCP pancreatitis correlates with the extent of pancreatic ductal filling, further underscoring an advantage of MRCP for pancreatic ductal imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-cholangiopancreatography/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2843337\"><span class=\"h2\">Pancreatic duct disruption</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Causes of pancreatic duct disruption include acute and chronic pancreatitis, blunt or penetrating trauma, and complications of surgical procedures such as splenectomy. MRCP may be a particularly attractive option in patients following traumatic injury when performance of ERCP may not be possible. Findings suggestive of a pancreatic duct disruption on MRCP include ductal dilation proximal to the disruption, focal interruption of duct continuity, apparent communication of the duct with fluid collections, and pancreatic fracture involving the pancreatic duct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-cholangiopancreatography/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. In addition to aiding with the diagnosis of pancreatic duct disruption, MRCP can also be used to follow-up with patients who are managed conservatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-cholangiopancreatography/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. </p><p>In a small retrospective series that used ERCP as the gold standard for diagnosing a ductal disruption, MRCP correctly identified in 21 of 23 patients with a ductal disruption (91 percent sensitivity) and eight of eight patients with an intact duct (100 percent specificity) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-cholangiopancreatography/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H65081352\"><span class=\"h2\">Secretin-enhanced MRCP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Secretin-enhanced MRCP is being increasingly studied for evaluation of pancreatic exocrine function and in the early diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-cholangiopancreatography/abstract/44-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-50</a>].
