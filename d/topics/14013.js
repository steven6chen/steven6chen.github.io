The risks of travelers' diarrhea, viral respiratory illness, food poisoning, and common community illnesses are similar to those in developed countries in other parts of the world. Outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis, hepatitis A virus, and salmonellosis occur from time to time, although urban water supplies are usually safe. In New Zealand, the consumption of shellfish collected from areas where human effluent contamination may have occurred, such as marinas, should be avoided, as outbreaks of gastrointestinal illnesses such as shigellosis have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potential-health-hazards-in-travelers-to-australia-new-zealand-and-the-southwestern-pacific-oceania/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

It is caused by <em>Rickettsia australis</em> and transmitted by <em>Ixodes</em> ticks. Native rats and bandicoots are the vertebrate hosts. It usually causes a mild illness with the acute onset of fever, myalgia, and headache, usually followed by the development of a maculopapular rash within up to 12 days. Occasionally, the rash is petechial or vesicular. There is usually localized lymphadenopathy, and careful inspection may reveal a small eschar at the site of the tick bite.

The most common occupational infection is due to <em>Leptospira borgpetersenii</em> serovar hardjo associated with the dairy and beef industries.

Sea snakes and other venomous marine risks are similar to those in tropical Australia. A major concern is lack of locally available antivenoms, even in major centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potential-health-hazards-in-travelers-to-australia-new-zealand-and-the-southwestern-pacific-oceania/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].

Scombroid fish poisoning is due to decomposition of certain fish resulting in accumulation of histamine and related substances in the flesh [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potential-health-hazards-in-travelers-to-australia-new-zealand-and-the-southwestern-pacific-oceania/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. Symptoms begin soon after ingestion and consist of paresthesia around the mouth and abdominal pain followed by vomiting and diarrhea. Some patients have flushing, headache, urticaria, and wheeze. The illness is usually self-limited and settles in a few hours. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scombroid-histamine-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Scombroid (histamine) poisoning&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Ciguatera fish poisoning occurs in the southwestern Pacific (especially Kiribati, Tuvalu, French Polynesia, Vanuatu, and Cook Islands), Queensland, and the Gulf of Carpentaria, although fish are sometimes transported large distances to be served in restaurants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potential-health-hazards-in-travelers-to-australia-new-zealand-and-the-southwestern-pacific-oceania/abstract/80,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,81</a>]. The fish responsible are at the top of the food chain and include cod, sturgeon fish, parrotfish, red bass, Spanish mackerel, and barracuda. The toxin comes from dinoflagellates and binds to sodium channels, causing depolarization with acute diarrhea and abdominal pain, lasting two to four days. Subsequent neurologic symptoms include myalgia, paradoxical &quot;burning&quot; of skin on contact with cold water, paresthesias, and a mood disorder lasting weeks to months.
