The major hematologic manifestations of SLE include anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> splenomegaly. These abnormalities may be a manifestation of SLE, related to another concomitant disease, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> caused by an SLE treatment. Alterations in hemostasis have also been observed in SLE patients and are likely associated with autoantibodies. Autoantibodies may be prothrombotic (eg, antiphospholipid antibodies [aPL]) or, conversely, may inhibit the function of clotting factors and increase the risk of serious bleeding.</p><p>This topic review will provide an overview of the hematologic manifestations of SLE.

ACD results from upregulation of the iron regulatory protein hepcidin, which prevents iron from being incorporated into developing red blood cells (RBCs). The anemia in ACD is typically mild, normocytic, and normochromic; the reticulocyte count is low; and iron stores are adequate. However, there are no specific laboratory tests for ACD, and it is a diagnosis of exclusion. Additional details of the evaluation for suspected ACD and the pathologic mechanisms involved are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-of-chronic-disease-inflammation#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anemia of chronic disease/inflammation&quot;, section on 'Laboratory findings'</a>.)</p><p>In the absence of either symptoms attributable to anemia (eg, dyspnea on exertion, easy fatigability) or renal insufficiency, ACD does not require specific treatment other than treatment of the underlying condition (ie, treatment of SLE). However, patients with symptoms due to anemia may require treatment with an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent. There are no clinical trials evaluating the use of these drugs in SLE patients, and the ACD is usually treated in a manner similar to adults without SLE (ie, by treating the underlying cause[s]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-of-chronic-disease-inflammation#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anemia of chronic disease/inflammation&quot;, section on 'Treatment issues'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h4\">Iron deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Iron deficiency anemia is also common in SLE and is present in about a third of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13</a>]. Iron deficiency is usually caused by blood loss (eg, due to menorrhagia or gastrointestinal bleeding), and identifying and addressing the source of blood loss is an essential component of therapy. The anemia of iron deficiency anemia is typically microcytic and hypochromic with an inappropriately low reticulocyte count; the serum ferritin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the transferrin saturation are low; and the <span class=\"nowrap\">transferrin/total</span> iron binding capacity is high (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F109258\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109258 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>There are two important caveats about iron deficiency anemia in individuals with SLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/6,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ferritin is an acute phase reactant and may not accurately reflect iron stores in individuals with SLE (ie, a normal ferritin may be present despite reduced iron stores) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. &#160; However, the ferritin will usually be below 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> in the setting of iron deficiency, even if inflammation is present. In patients who do not have active inflammation at the time of testing, the ferritin is likely to be an accurate reflection of iron stores. Other testing, such as soluble transferrin receptor, may be helpful in selected cases with indeterminant results or discordance between the clinical picture and initial laboratory testing, but this test is not readily available and is rarely needed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-and-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Patients with inconclusive initial testing or comorbidities'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients may have concomitant iron deficiency and ACD in SLE due to combined blood loss and chronic inflammation. The treatment of iron deficiency in the setting of chronic inflammation may be more challenging because inflammation reduces absorption of oral iron. Specialist input may be required in challenging cases to assist with diagnosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults#H1809132799\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of iron deficiency anemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Patient populations'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Causes of blood loss may be similar to those observed in the general population. It is not known whether SLE confers an increased risk of peptic ulcer disease in addition to that of known risk factors (eg, use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs] or <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> infection). Coadministration of glucocorticoids may exacerbate NSAID-induced peptic ulceration. However, the management of peptic ulcer disease and other sources of gastrointestinal blood loss is the same as that for patients without SLE.

Warm autoimmune hemolysis is much more common. Of note, some individuals may have an autoantibody to RBCs that does not cause hemolysis. Thus, the presence of a positive direct antiglobulin test (direct Coombs test) does not necessarily imply that the individual has autoimmune hemolysis. The presence of both immunoglobulin (typically immunoglobulin G [IgG]) and complement on the RBC surface is usually associated with some degree of hemolysis, while the presence of complement alone (eg, C3 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> C4) is often not associated with hemolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>].

When therapy is needed, we typically use high-dose glucocorticoids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, 1 to 1.5 mg per kg daily), with the dose tapered once a sustained response is achieved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Other immunosuppressive therapies, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=danazol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">danazol</a>, splenectomy, or intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG), have also been used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/3,19-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,19-30</a>]. Rituximab is becoming a favored therapy for autoimmune hemolysis associated with SLE, both because it can treat other manifestations of SLE and because it may allow the patient to avoid splenectomy.

The nodes are typically soft, nontender, discrete, varying in size from 0.5 to several centimeters, and usually detected in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Lymphadenopathy is more frequently noted at the onset of disease or in association with an exacerbation. Lymphadenopathy due to SLE responds quickly to low to moderate doses of glucocorticoids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, 20 to 40 mg) with a marked decrease in the size of the lymph nodes, which is somewhat less true for lymphoma and highly unlikely for a metastasis or infection. In lymphadenopathy due to SLE, biopsies reveal areas of follicular hyperplasia and necrosis; the appearance of hematoxylin bodies is highly suggestive of SLE, although this finding is unusual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/5,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,60</a>]. Despite these observations, treatment with glucocorticoids as a means of determining the cause of lymphadenopathy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> biopsy of the affected lymph nodes is not routinely done unless the lymphadenopathy continues to increase <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cause vascular or other compromise.</p><p>Lymph node enlargement in individuals with SLE can also be due to infection or a lymphoproliferative disease such as lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The risks of infections and lymphoproliferative disorders are more common in SLE than in the general population due to immune deficits and dysregulation. Various cohort series and case-control studies have demonstrated risks of non-Hodgkin lymphoma to be approximately three- to fourfold greater in SLE compared with the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/61-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-63</a>]. The risk of Hodgkin lymphoma may also be increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. It is not clear whether immunosuppressive therapy increases this risk or is merely a marker of more active disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults#H84666354\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management and prognosis of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults&quot;, section on 'Is cancer risk increased?'</a>.)</p><p>There are no specific tests to distinguish between a lymphoid malignancy and reactive lymphadenopathy due to infection or SLE disease flare. Increased numbers of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood (mature or immature) suggest a lymphoid malignancy, but atypical lymphocytes may be present in viral infections. Increased neutrophils <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tender lymphadenopathy are more consistent with infection. In cases in which the cause of lymphadenopathy is not clear <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lymphoma is suspected, flow cytometry on peripheral blood may be helpful. Flow cytometry often detects the presence of a monoclonal population of lymphocytes, indicative of lymphoma, in cases of lymphoma associated with diffuse lymphadenopathy.

The mechanism is not well understood. Splenomegaly is not necessarily associated with cytopenias, although often mild cytopenias may be seen due to splenic pooling of blood and blood cells. Biopsy is not used routinely, but if performed it may show an onion skin appearance of the splenic arteries, a lesion that is thought to represent healed vasculitis.

Increases in the number of neutrophils can be seen with disease flare or infection. A shift of granulocytes to more immature forms (a &quot;left&quot; shift) suggests infection. Increased numbers of lymphocytes suggests a lymphoid malignancy, especially when accompanied by lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly.
