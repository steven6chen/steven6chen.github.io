The true incidence of this infection is difficult to establish because of the difficulty in distinguishing murine typhus from other causes of rash and fever. </p><p>This topic will review the diagnosis and treatment of murine typhus. A discussion on the epidemiology and clinical manifestations is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-murine-typhus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The epidemiology and clinical manifestations of murine typhus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8972893\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with other rickettsial diseases, a reliable diagnostic laboratory test in the early phase of illness is not available. Thus, the diagnosis is usually based upon the typical clinical findings developing in an appropriate epidemiologic setting. The exposure history may not be helpful, since most patients do not remember a fleabite or contact with rodents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-murine-typhus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis is usually confirmed serologically after a course of empiric therapy with a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloramphenicol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloramphenicol</a>. Although rickettsial cultures of blood, skin biopsy with direct fluorescent antibody staining, and polymerase chain reaction have been used to diagnose murine typhus, the mainstay of diagnosis is the indirect fluorescent antibody test. This test is available through all state health department laboratories. A diagnosis of murine typhus can be established by a fourfold antibody titer rise between acute and convalescent serum samples.</p><p>However, it is important to note that <em>R. typhi</em> cross-reacts with <em>Rickettsia prowazekii</em>, the agent of epidemic typhus, and to a variety of spotted fever group antigens, including <em>Rickettsia felis</em> and <em>Rickettsia rickettsii</em>. Western blot testing and cross-adsorption studies can often help determine the infecting rickettsia in such cases. However, these techniques require specialized laboratories and such testing is expensive and time consuming [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-murine-typhus/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Polymerase chain reaction technology can be used to confirm the diagnosis of murine typhus. This technique has been used successfully on blood, plasma, and tissue samples but is not widely available in routine clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-murine-typhus/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>In regions where laboratory diagnostic facilities are limited or nonexistent, it is often impossible to diagnose murine typhus and distinguish it from other endemic rickettsial and non-rickettsial diseases, such as dengue and leptospirosis, after routine screening tests for malaria are negative. This is a particularly common dilemma in patients during the early phases of their illness and in patients with fever, myalgias, and headache who lack characteristic skin rashes or lesions. In such situations, empirical treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> is appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-murine-typhus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H8972900\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1123918419\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of fever and rash is broad and can include viral, bacterial, spirochetal, and rickettsial infections, as well as non-infectious etiologies (eg, drug reactions). A careful history that assesses for exposures to animals, as well as travel to certain geographic regions, may increase a provider&rsquo;s suspicion for diagnosing murine typhus. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Viral etiologies that should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a patient presenting with fever and rash include rubella, measles, mononucleosis, coxsackievirus, echovirus, Ziki, and dengue virus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measles: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rubella\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rubella&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enterovirus-and-parechovirus-infections-clinical-features-laboratory-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Enterovirus and parechovirus infections: Clinical features, laboratory diagnosis, treatment, and prevention&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-epstein-barr-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and treatment of Epstein-Barr virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In returning travelers, murine typhus is often confused with dengue and Ziki virus as all three illnesses occur in tropical regions, commonly present as fever with non-specific flu-like symptoms (eg, myalgias and headaches), and are often associated with thrombocytopenia, rash, and sometimes petechia. However, there are some differences in the clinical manifestations and pattern of laboratory abnormalities that may differentiate these infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-murine-typhus/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. As an example, in one small study, patients with dengue had lower neutrophil counts and C-reactive protein levels, and were less likely to have hepatitis, as compared with those who had typhus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-murine-typhus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In another study comparing dengue and typhus, patients with murine typhus were more likely to have fevers of &ge;8 days, C-reactive protein levels &gt;31.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L,</span> platelet counts &gt;63,000, and an absence of bone pain and bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-murine-typhus/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A detailed review of fever in the returning traveler is found elsewhere.

In areas such as Thailand and Taiwan, murine and scrub typhus are both endemic, and although rare, patients may manifest concurrent infections with <em>R. typhi</em> and <em>Orientia tsutsugamushi</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-murine-typhus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

The clinical response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> is generally quite rapid. In a series of 137 patients, defervescence within two days occurred more frequently in patients treated with doxycycline than those who were untreated (79 versus 15 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-murine-typhus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Similar findings were reported in a study of 23 children with murine typhus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-murine-typhus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Defervescence occurred in a mean of 35 hours (range 4 to 66 hours) after the institution of doxycycline or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a>; treatment was started after a mean of 11 days of illness.</p><p>There is no solid proof that quinolones are effective in murine typhus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-murine-typhus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Despite this, some authors have suggested these agents as alternatives for the treatment of murine typhus for individuals unable to take tetracyclines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-murine-typhus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In one study, patients treated with quinolones remained febrile longer than those who received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> (4.2 versus 2.9 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-murine-typhus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H132516762\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We treat all patients in whom a diagnosis of murine typhus is suspected. Although spontaneous recovery generally occurs within two weeks in untreated patients, rare fatalities have been reported and antibiotics significantly shorten the duration of illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-murine-typhus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The drug of choice is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> in nonpregnant adults and children. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloramphenicol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Chloramphenicol</a> is the preferred treatment for most pregnant women, Our approach to treatment is as follows:</p><p><strong>Adults</strong> &mdash; The dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> for adults should be 100 mg orally twice daily. </p><p><strong>Children </strong>&mdash; The dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> for children who weigh &lt;45.4 kg (100 pounds) is 2.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> twice per day (maximum daily dose 200 mg). Children who weigh &ge;45.4 kg (100 pounds) should receive the adult dose. Tetracyclines can cause dental staining when administered to children. However, the risk of dental staining with doxycycline is minimal if a short course is administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-murine-typhus/abstract/4,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,14</a>]. Furthermore, this risk must be weighed against the one in 25,000 to 40,000 risk of fatal aplastic anemia due to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloramphenicol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloramphenicol</a> therapy.</p><p><strong>Pregnancy</strong> &mdash; Our approach to the treatment of <em>R. typhi</em> in pregnant women is the same as our approach to the treatment of <em>R. rickettsii</em> (ie, Rocky Mountain spotted fever) in pregnant women and is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever#H38948640\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of Rocky Mountain spotted fever&quot;, section on 'Pregnant women'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8972907\"><span class=\"h2\">Duration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal duration of therapy for murine typhus has not been established in controlled clinical trials. Despite reported success with a single 200 mg dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-murine-typhus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], relapse of infection has been described in patients who received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloramphenicol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloramphenicol</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-murine-typhus/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Thus, we recommend that doxycycline be continued for 48 hours after the patient becomes afebrile or for a minimum of five days.
