AIs inhibit the cytochrome P450 CYP-19 enzyme responsible for the peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-aromatase-inhibitor-induced-bone-loss/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Treatment with AIs, therefore, results in bone loss due to estrogen deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-aromatase-inhibitor-induced-bone-loss/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. As more women are exposed to AIs, it is important to understand their adverse effects on the skeleton. The evaluation and management of bone loss associated with the use of AIs are reviewed here. The role of AIs as adjuvant therapy for breast cancer is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-endocrine-therapy-for-non-metastatic-hormone-receptor-positive-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant endocrine therapy for non-metastatic, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ESTROGEN DEFICIENCY AND BONE LOSS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The central role of estrogen deficiency in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women has been recognized for many years. Estrogen inhibits bone resorption, and after menopause, estrogen deficiency results in increased bone resorption and rapid bone loss. The mechanisms by which estrogen regulates bone remodeling are not fully established. However, estrogen is thought to affect osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast function through its effects on local cytokines and growth factors (eg, produced by either bone cells or adjacent marrow cells). This topic is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-osteoporosis#H341630\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of osteoporosis&quot;, section on 'Sex steroid deficiency'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">AI-induced estrogen deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the primary source of estrogen in premenopausal women is the ovaries, the primary source in postmenopausal women is the adrenal gland, where aromatase converts adrenal androgens to estrogens. Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) prevent conversion of androgens to estrogens. In postmenopausal women, AIs cause relatively rapid decreases in circulating estrogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-aromatase-inhibitor-induced-bone-loss/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-androgen-deficiency-and-therapy-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of androgen deficiency and therapy in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The AIs are divided into steroidal inactivators (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=exemestane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">exemestane</a>) and nonsteroidal inhibitors (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=letrozole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">letrozole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anastrozole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">anastrozole</a>). Exemestane is a steroidal analogue of androstenedione and binds irreversibly to aromatase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-aromatase-inhibitor-induced-bone-loss/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Nonsteroidal inhibitors, like letrozole or anastrozole, bind reversibly to the heme group of the enzyme by way of a basic nitrogen atom. At clinical doses, these third-generation AIs are successful in inhibiting greater than 97 percent of aromatase activity in vivo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-aromatase-inhibitor-induced-bone-loss/abstract/4,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8,9</a>]. The half-life of these compounds varies from 27 hours for exemestane to 48 hours for letrozole and anastrozole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-aromatase-inhibitor-induced-bone-loss/abstract/7,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10,11</a>].</p><p>In vivo animal studies suggest that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exemestane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">exemestane</a> may be more bone sparing than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=letrozole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">letrozole</a>, owing to its androgenic structure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-aromatase-inhibitor-induced-bone-loss/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. However, there are no human trials showing a differential effect of the individual AIs on bone. The MA-27 trial compared exemestane and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anastrozole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">anastrozole</a> as adjuvant therapy in postmenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-aromatase-inhibitor-induced-bone-loss/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Clinical fracture data were collected as adverse events. Although self-reported new diagnoses of osteoporosis were significantly less frequent on exemestane than anastrozole, there was no difference in the number of new clinical fragility fractures between the two groups (4 percent in each group).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">SKELETAL OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breast cancer treatments, such as surgical oophorectomy, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, chemotherapy that induces ovarian failure, and AIs all decrease endogenous estrogens, cause bone loss, and increase the risk of fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-aromatase-inhibitor-induced-bone-loss/abstract/15-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-21</a>]. The more sudden and severe the estrogen deprivation occurs, the greater the magnitude of bone loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-aromatase-inhibitor-induced-bone-loss/abstract/16,17,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17,22,23</a>].

Bone loss slowed in the remaining 18 months of the study, declining an additional 1.0 and 0.8 percent at the LS and TH, respectively, in subjects assigned to exemestane.</p><p/><p>In premenopausal women, in whom the primary source of estrogen is the ovaries, AIs are not effective. However, in combination with the GnRH agonist <a href=\"topic.htm?path=goserelin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">goserelin</a>, AIs cause more bone loss than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a>. In the Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group 12 (ABCSG-12) trial, premenopausal women were randomly assigned to tamoxifen plus goserelin versus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anastrozole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">anastrozole</a> plus goserelin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-aromatase-inhibitor-induced-bone-loss/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Half of each group received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a> (ZA).

In contrast, BTMs remained constant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-aromatase-inhibitor-induced-bone-loss/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] or decreased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-aromatase-inhibitor-induced-bone-loss/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>] with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> therapy. The use of BTMs is not routinely recommended for use in monitoring patients receiving AIs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-physiology-and-biochemical-markers-of-bone-turnover\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bone physiology and biochemical markers of bone turnover&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-biochemical-markers-of-bone-turnover-in-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of biochemical markers of bone turnover in osteoporosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Fracture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In several of the AI trials, fracture data were reported (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F70977\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70977 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-aromatase-inhibitor-induced-bone-loss/abstract/24,28-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,28-33</a>]. In a meta-analysis of seven trials comparing AIs with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> in postmenopausal women with early stage breast cancer, use of AIs significantly increased the risk of bone fractures (odds ratio [OR] 1.47, 95% CI 1.34-1.61) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-aromatase-inhibitor-induced-bone-loss/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The majority of the trials were not designed to explore fracture outcomes as primary events; therefore, fracture and other skeletal events were collected as adverse events as part of a long-term safety and tolerability assessment. With the exception of the MA-17 trial, all adjuvant AI trials demonstrated a significant increase in the rate of overall fractures compared with tamoxifen.</p><p>The MA-17 trial examined the efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=letrozole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">letrozole</a> versus placebo in postmenopausal women who had completed five years of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> therapy. Of 5149 women, 256 had a clinical fracture (5.3 percent of patients assigned to letrozole compared with 4.6 percent assigned to placebo) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-aromatase-inhibitor-induced-bone-loss/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The MA-17 trial is a &quot;switch&quot; trial, in which trial participants previously received five years of tamoxifen therapy. As tamoxifen mitigates bone loss in postmenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-aromatase-inhibitor-induced-bone-loss/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], it may have contributed to decreasing the fracture rates in the AI treatment arm. The IES and combined <span class=\"nowrap\">ABCSG-8/Antithrombotic</span> Regimen and Outcome (ARNO) trials are also &quot;switch&quot; trials, but the duration of tamoxifen treatment (two to three years) was shorter than in the MA-17 trial, which could account for the difference in the findings.</p><p>In the ATAC trial comparing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anastrozole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">anastrozole</a> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a>, described above, the annual incidence of fractures was higher in women receiving anastrozole (11 versus 7.7 percent) throughout the five years of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-aromatase-inhibitor-induced-bone-loss/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. However, beginning in the sixth year, the fracture rate decreased in the women previously assigned to anastrozole treatment such that, in years 7 to 9, the fracture rates with both treatments were similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-aromatase-inhibitor-induced-bone-loss/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. This suggests that AI-related fracture rates will decrease upon cessation of the drug.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment of fracture risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because AIs are associated with bone loss and fracture, women who will be initiating AIs require fracture risk assessment. Some studies demonstrate that low bone mineral density (BMD) is associated with an increased risk of fracture, whereas others demonstrate that a large proportion of individuals who experience nontraumatic fractures actually have T-scores in the nonosteoporotic range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-aromatase-inhibitor-induced-bone-loss/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. However, there are several clinical risk factors for fracture that are independent of BMD, such as advancing age, prior history of fragility fracture, chronic glucocorticoid use, low body mass index (BMI), parental history of hip fracture, cigarette smoking, and excess alcohol. Thus, fracture risk assessment should include evaluation of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical risk factors for osteoporosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BMD measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA)</p><p/><p>We typically perform a history and physical examination to elicit clinical risk factors for fracture and lifestyle factors that contribute to bone loss, including smoking, excessive alcohol, physical inactivity, and poor nutrition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F76445\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76445 \">table 2</a>).

This topic deals with administration of pharmacologic therapy when no decision to administer for breast cancer effect has been made.</p><p>Women with the highest risk of fracture are the ones most likely to benefit from drug therapy; therefore, selection of women based upon fracture risk, as determined by a combination of BMD and clinical risk factors, is desirable. For the prevention of fracture in patients taking AIs, we suggest pharmacologic therapy in patients at high risk for fracture, including patients with osteoporosis (T-score &lt;-2.5 or history of fragility fracture) and patients with T-scores between -1.0 and -2.5 who have risks for fracture other than AI therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F76445\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76445 \">table 2</a>).

FRAX can be used to select candidates for osteoporosis treatment, particularly when the BMD T-score is between -1.0 and -2.5, and there is no history of a fragility fracture. A reasonable cut point for therapeutic intervention that may be cost effective in some settings is a 10-year probability of hip fracture or combined major osteoporotic fracture of &ge;3.0 or &ge;20 percent, respectively. These are the same cut points used to identify women without a history of breast cancer for osteoporosis treatment. These cut points have not specifically been assessed in women taking AIs.

Risk stratification based upon baseline BMD T-scores and clinical risk factors can identify who is more or less likely to benefit from therapy. For women initiating AIs who have a BMD T-score &le;-2.5 or history of a fragility fracture, we recommend pharmacologic treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). We also suggest treatment for women with a BMD T-score between -1.0 and -2.5 who have risks for fracture other than AI therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F76445\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76445 \">table 2</a>)&nbsp;(<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). In such women, a reasonable cut point for therapeutic intervention that may be cost effective in some settings is a 10-year probability of hip fracture or combined major osteoporotic fracture of &ge;3.0 or &ge;20 percent, respectively. The 10-year probability of hip and major osteoporotic fracture can be calculated for individual patients using the Fracture Assessment Tool (<a href=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/FRAX/&amp;token=Is0F5/ImQqBopGKrWR2x/MCmpmhgzdFRoihp7Vybx7uk/lvW7TmyNtcbx4DNfIl6&amp;TOPIC_ID=2062\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">FRAX</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2416463\" class=\"local\">'Candidates for pharmacologic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who do not meet the above criteria, we typically measure BMD (DXA) every two years and prescribe pharmacologic therapy as indicated above.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the prevention of bone loss and fracture, we suggest bisphosphonates as first-line therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Denosumab</a> is an alternative option for women who do not tolerate or are unresponsive to oral and intravenous (IV) bisphosphonates. (See <a href=\"#H8596913\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Bisphosphonates'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Denosumab'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The choice of bisphosphonate depends upon patient preference and cost. When using oral bisphosphonates as initial therapy, we prefer weekly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risedronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risedronate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alendronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alendronate</a>. IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a> (ZA) is an alternative initial therapy. The optimal schedule and duration of ZA has not been defined for AI-induced bone loss. Four mg every six months or 5 mg annually are reasonable dosing options. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Choice of bisphosphonate and dosing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no consensus on the optimal strategy for monitoring patients on therapy. However, we typically measure BMD every two years after initiation of pharmacologic therapy.
