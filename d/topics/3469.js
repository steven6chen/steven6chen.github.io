Pseudo-obstruction may be acute or chronic and is characterized by the presence of dilation of the bowel on imaging. When there is evidence of chronic small intestinal motility disorder in the absence of bowel dilatation, the preferred term is chronic intestinal dysmotility.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the etiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Acute pseudo-obstruction, chronic intestinal dysmotility, and slow transit <span class=\"nowrap\">constipation/colon</span> inertia are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-colonic-pseudo-obstruction-ogilvies-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie's syndrome)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-evaluation-of-chronic-constipation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and evaluation of chronic constipation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO) is a rare disorder that may be due to an underlying neuropathic disorder (involving the enteric nervous system or extrinsic nervous system), a myopathic disorder (involving the smooth muscle), or abnormality in the interstitial cell of Cajal (ICC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intestinal-pseudo-obstruction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Therefore, there are parallels in the pathobiological mechanisms of CIPO and gastroparesis.</p><p>Neuropathic, myopathic, or ICC abnormalities may be idiopathic or secondary to another disease. Approximately half of the cases of CIPO are secondary to neurologic, paraneoplastic, autoimmune, <span class=\"nowrap\">metabolic/endocrine,</span> and infectious diseases.</p><p>More than one of the elements of the neuromuscular apparatus of the gut may be affected in certain diseases. For example, there is an intrinsic neuropathic phase of scleroderma, before the smooth muscle involvement results in myopathy. Similarly, mitochondrial cytopathy results in neuropathy and eventually myopathy. Moreover, diabetes affects extrinsic nerves through autonomic neuropathy, and the ICCs and amyloidosis causes an extrinsic neuropathy followed by myopathic CIPO. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Degenerative neuropathies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurologic (eg, Parkinson disease and Shy-Drager syndrome) and metabolic disorders (eg, diabetes mellitus) can affect the extrinsic nerve pathways supplying the gut. Degenerative neuropathies may result from several putative pathogenetic mechanisms, including altered calcium signaling, mitochondrial dysfunction, and production of free radicals, leading to degeneration and loss of gut intrinsic neurons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intestinal-pseudo-obstruction/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Neuropathic disorders may be complicated by a myopathic stage when the muscle layer is infiltrated, as in amyloidosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Paraneoplastic immune-mediated pseudo-obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CIPO has been reported in association with small cell lung cancers or carcinoid tumors and malignant thymoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intestinal-pseudo-obstruction/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. These patients often have antineuronal nuclear (anti-Hu) antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intestinal-pseudo-obstruction/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The antibody is postulated to be directed toward an epitope that is shared between the neuronal elements within the enteric nervous system and the underlying malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intestinal-pseudo-obstruction/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Paraneoplastic syndromes may evoke an <span class=\"nowrap\">inflammatory/immune</span> infiltrate targeting neurons located in both submucosal and myenteric ganglia of the enteric nervous system (ENS); the cellular infiltrate along with circulating antineuronal antibodies is thought to damage the enteric reflexes, thereby contributing to paraneoplastic dysmotility.

Scleroderma, dermatomyositis, and systemic lupus erythematosus can alter the enteric nerves, the smooth muscle cells, and possibly the ICC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intestinal-pseudo-obstruction/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. </p><p>In one case report, CIPO resulted from the development of antibodies to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buserelin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buserelin</a>, an analogue of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GNRH), leading to the immune-mediated destruction of myenteric neurons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intestinal-pseudo-obstruction/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A small proportion of patients with inflammatory enteric neuropathy have antibodies directed towards neuronal ion channels (voltage-gated potassium channels and neuronal alpha3-AChR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intestinal-pseudo-obstruction/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Infectious</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chagas disease is the most common infectious cause of CIPO. It is endemic to certain countries, such as Brazil, and is infrequently encountered in patients in the United States unless they have lived for extended periods in South America.</p><p>Viruses may cause morphologic (ie, inflammatory) or functional changes of the enteric nervous system and extrinsic neural pathways supplying the gut and are detectable in a subset of patients with CIPO. </p><p>A potential role of a chronic JC virus infection has been suggested in observational studies. In one case-control study comparing specimens from 10 patients with CIPO with 61 control specimens, JC virus proteins (TAg and VP1) were identified in glial cells of the myenteric plexus in 7 out of 10 adult patients with idiopathic CIPO and in none of the control specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intestinal-pseudo-obstruction/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

A very localized form of genetic neuromuscular denervation or aganglionosis, Hirschsprung disease, is associated with secondary dilatation proximal to the affected segment. Other syndromes associated with mitochondrial cytopathy are also associated with CIPO, including mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), and myoclonus epilepsy associated with ragged-red fibers (MERRF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intestinal-pseudo-obstruction/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

MR angiography should be considered in patients with evidence of obstruction when congenital or acquired vascular abnormalities are suspected based on enterography. Although a pilot study suggested that cine MR imaging may be used to assess small bowel motility in patients with CIPO by quantitative analysis of luminal diameter, further studies are needed to validate these results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intestinal-pseudo-obstruction/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83057611\"><span class=\"h2\">Endoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Upper endoscopy and colonoscopy should be performed to rule out an intraluminal or extraluminal cause of obstruction and to identify the location of the obstruction (upper [gastrojejunal] or lower [ileocolonic] gastrointestinal tract).

Using resin pellets mixed with a meal, small bowel transit time in healthy individuals reportedly ranged from 151 to 290 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intestinal-pseudo-obstruction/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Using the liquid phase of a mixed solid&ndash;liquid meal, small bowel transit time ranged from 72 to 392 minutes in healthy individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intestinal-pseudo-obstruction/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>While interpreting scintigraphy results, it is important to note that delayed colonic transit may cause delayed small bowel transit. Therefore, it is important to consider gastrointestinal transit in all three main regions (stomach, small bowel, and colon) before concluding that delayed small bowel transit defines small intestinal dysmotility. A useful clue to clinically significant small intestinal disease is the finding of delayed gastric emptying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intestinal-pseudo-obstruction/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. Thus, when small bowel and colonic transit are delayed and gastric emptying is normal, the main focus of treatment should be normalization of colonic motor function and treatment of constipation, rather than attempting to normalize the small bowel transit alone. Novel approaches using fewer scans have been devised to simplify the evaluation of bowel transit using scintigraphy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intestinal-pseudo-obstruction/abstract/38,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,42,43</a>]. However, there is a wide range of normality (essentially 0 to 100 percent in a sample of 319 healthy volunteers) in the surrogate endpoint of small bowel transit commonly used in scintigraphic studies that is the percent colonic filling at six hours. Therefore, small bowel transit measurement may require more scans to have sufficient specificity to diagnose intestinal motility disorder and in these situations, careful assessment of gastric and colonic transit is also key.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83057822\"><span class=\"h3\">Wireless motility capsule</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Small bowel transit in suspected chronic intestinal dysmotility can also be measured by wireless motility capsule, which assesses small bowel transit time by a sharp increase in pH on entry into the duodenum and by a fall in pH at the ileocecal junction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intestinal-pseudo-obstruction/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

Mortality rates of approximately 10 percent have been reported in adults, including HPN-related complications in 45 to 80 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intestinal-pseudo-obstruction/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>].</p><p>In one series in adults that included 59 consecutive patients identified between 1985 and 2001 who were followed for a median of 4.6 years, symptoms associated with CIPO became progressively more severe with time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intestinal-pseudo-obstruction/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Most patients had undergone a potentially dangerous surgery (mean 2.96 per patient) before a diagnosis was established, underscoring the need to recognize its presentation. Long-term outcomes were poor despite medical and surgical treatment. Approximately one-third of patients required long-term HPN, while about two-thirds had some nutritional limitation. Four patients underwent small bowel transplantation. Overall, 10 percent of patients died of disease-related complications.</p><p>Limited experience suggests that adults with CIPO and irreversible <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a> complications benefit from isolated intestinal transplant (associated with different surgical techniques to empty the native stomach). In one study at a single institution; this strategy was reported to achieve good gastric emptying, with resumption of oral feeding and graft and patient survivals that are comparable to those associated with isolated intestinal transplant for short bowel syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intestinal-pseudo-obstruction/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1074401490\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Segments of affected bowel appear dilated on radiography. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal pain and distension are the most common clinical features. Patients may have diarrhea due to small bowel bacterial overgrowth. Nausea, vomiting, and weight loss are predominant symptoms in patients with CIPO involving the proximal gastrointestinal tract. Other features include anorexia, alternating bowel habits, and urinary symptoms. These symptoms may be acute, recurrent, or chronic. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of CIPO is based on the presence of longstanding symptoms of obstruction in the absence of an anatomic cause of obstruction despite endoscopy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiologic examination, and confirmation of impaired motility with scintigraphy. (See <a href=\"#H61539017\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients should undergo laboratory testing to identify secondary causes of CIPO. (See <a href=\"#H209092\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory studies'</a> above.)<br/><br/>In patients with abnormal transit on scintigraphy and in whom there is a known underlying disease, no further investigation is necessary and appropriate therapy can be initiated. In patients with abnormal transit on scintigraphy and no known underlying disease, manometry should be performed. (See <a href=\"#H17216966\" class=\"local\">'Identifying the etiology'</a> above.)<br/><br/>Autonomic testing is useful in patients with evidence of a neuropathic disorder on manometry, but without a known underlying neurologic disorder. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Autonomic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nutritional support is important, particularly for those who have had recurrent vomiting or reduced oral intake. Small meals consisting of liquid or homogenized foods are better tolerated than solids. Hypercaloric liquid formulations should be used in patients with low caloric intake. Oral or enteral nutrition is typically used for neuropathic disorders or in whom the motility disorder is localized to the stomach and duodenum. Parenteral nutrition may be necessary for patients with severe dysmotility (usually myopathic pseudo-obstruction). (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Nutritional support'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with CIPO who have steatorrhea, vitamin B12 malabsorption, or folate excess (suggestive of bacterial overgrowth), we suggest empiric treatment with antibiotics (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Jejunal aspirate cultures are needed if steatorrhea does not respond to empiric antibiotics. Antibiotics, usually on a rotating basis, are used in patients who have confirmed small bowel bacterial overgrowth. (See <a href=\"#H4428094\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For symptomatic relief in patients with CIPO, we suggest that prokinetic agents, particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a> for acute exacerbations of CIPO. For chronic symptoms of CIPO, we suggest cisapride, or where it is available, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prucalopride-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prucalopride</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Prokinetic agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery should be performed to provide access to the stomach or small bowel for venting and feeding. Resection of localized disease should be avoided in patients with CIPO. (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intestinal transplantation is indicated in patients in whom long-term parenteral nutrition cannot be initiated or continued safely.
