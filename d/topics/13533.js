Opioid use disorder can involve prescribed or nonprescribed use of pharmaceutical opioids or use of illicitly obtained heroin. Opioid use disorder is typically a chronic, relapsing illness, associated with significantly increased rates of morbidity and mortality. </p><p>In patients with opioid use disorder who have achieved abstinence through medically supervised withdrawal or other means, there are medication and nonmedication options for long-term maintenance treatment.

A relatively low dose of methadone (eg, 20 to 30 mg per day) can attenuate acute opioid withdrawal, but is usually not as effective at suppressing craving and blocking the effects of other opioids. Methadone dosing for opioid addiction differs significantly from doses used in the treatment of pain.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methadone</a> is usually administered in a single daily dose. Some clinics may offer &ldquo;split dosing,&rdquo; provided twice daily (eg, in cases of pregnancy or rapid methadone metabolism).</p><p>The initial dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> maintenance treatment may vary based on the time of the last opioid use, the amount used, and whether the patient has developed a reduction in tolerance to opioids (eg, patients who were recently released from incarceration or hospitalization may have significantly reduced tolerance). </p><p>A typical initial dose for opioid use disorder is 20 to 30 mg on the first day; most opioid treatment programs provide a first day dose of 30 mg. An additional 10 mg may be administered if the patient has significant withdrawal symptoms a few hours after the 30 mg dose. It is recommended that the first day dose not exceed 40 mg total. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methadone</a> is typically given as a liquid, often diluted with juice or water or artificially colored water. (Each patient receives a full cup of uniformly colored liquid regardless of the dose of methadone in order to reduce anxiety among patients about differences in dose. The dilution and coloring are also intended to reduce the likelihood of a patient injecting &ldquo;take-home&rdquo; methadone.) Methadone is available in a tablet form, as well as a dissolvable diskette, but these forms are less commonly used in opioid treatment programs in the US. </p><p>The dose is titrated up in 5 to 10 mg increments no more frequently than every three to five days over the next several weeks until a dose in the range of 60 to 80 mg daily is attained. If excessive opioid agonist effects (eg, sedation) from the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> occur, then further dose increases would be halted. Titration beyond 60 to 80 mg per day in patients without side effects proceeds more slowly over the next several weeks (frequently 10 mg a week), and is based upon alleviating cravings and opioid withdrawal symptoms (which are assessed daily), and the cessation of illicit opioid use (as determined by patient reports and urine testing). This gradual adjustment allows methadone to reach a pharmacologic steady state to match the patient&rsquo;s level of opioid tolerance and avoid intoxication or oversedation. The dose may be adjusted every one to two weeks by 5 to 10 mg each time based on patient assessment and feedback.</p><p>A variety of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> doses have been used for maintenance treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-opioid-use-disorder/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Methadone is given in doses sufficient that additional doses of an opioid (such as heroin) do not cause euphoria. Several randomized trials found that patients do better on higher (80 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> rather than lower methadone doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-opioid-use-disorder/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>]; doses at these levels (80 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> are not overly sedating following the development of tolerance. Some patients may not need doses as high as 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> and some patients may need doses greater than 100 mg per day. Patients who concurrently take benzodiazepines or use alcohol may be more likely to become sedated from methadone and should be evaluated for the risk of respiratory depression. The dose of methadone used should be based upon clinical response and considered in the context of nonpharmacologic treatment provided to the patient.</p><p>Initiation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> should be accompanied by ongoing monitoring. Administration in the United States mostly takes place in a controlled setting (eg, a licensed opioid treatment program) with direct observation of ingestion. There should be limited use of take-home doses (individual bottled doses of methadone to be taken outside the treatment setting, used with patients who are at low risk for diversion) early in treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-opioid-use-disorder/abstract/33,35,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,35,49</a>]. Eligibility for take-home doses is usually based on adherence to program requirements for counseling and abstinence from illicit drugs (based on urine toxicology testing), as well as absence of recent criminal activity and capacity to store the take-home doses safely in the home environment. Patients generally should have 30 to 90 days of continuous abstinence from illicit drugs to be eligible for take-home doses, although by federal regulations any patient can be given a single take-home dose on days the clinic is closed, such as Sundays or holidays.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19508664\"><span class=\"h3\">Special populations</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19912628\"><span class=\"h4\">Pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methadone</a> maintenance is first-line treatment for pregnant women with an opioid use disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-opioid-use-disorder/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

Buprenorphine is most commonly taken sublingually when used for the treatment of an opioid use disorder, and is typically administered in a combination preparation with naloxone, an opioid antagonist that has poor sublingual bioavailability.

When initiating buprenorphine or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buprenorphine-and-naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buprenorphine-naloxone</a>, it is recommended that the patient be abstinent from other opioids for a sufficient period, to enter a state of mild to moderate opioid withdrawal. This period of abstinence will vary as a function of the half-life of the opioid being used by the patient (eg, withdrawal from heroin can appear 6 to 12 hours after the last dose, while withdrawal from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> will be much longer). At the point at which early evidence of withdrawal appears, buprenorphine will then ameliorate the withdrawal by binding to and activating the mu-opioid receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-opioid-use-disorder/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].

Following observation for residual withdrawal symptoms, the dose may be increased in 4 mg increments, up to a maximum of 16 mg total (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">16/4</span> mg of buprenorphine-naloxone).
