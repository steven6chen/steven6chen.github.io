The clinical significance of VUR has been based on the premise that it predisposes patients to acute pyelonephritis by transporting bacteria from the bladder to the kidney, which may lead to renal scarring, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, aspects of this long-held belief have been increasingly questioned. In addition, data are inconclusive regarding the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions on long-term renal outcome and recurrent UTI. As a result, there is controversy regarding the optimal management of patients with VUR.</p><p>The management of VUR will be reviewed here. The presentation, diagnosis, and clinical course of VUR are discussed elsewhere in the program.

Therapeutic choices to manage VUR include watchful waiting (surveillance), antibiotic prophylaxis, and surgical correction. In addition, it is important to identify and treat older, toilet-trained children with BBD, as they are at risk for recurrent urinary tract infection, pyelonephritis, and VUR, and are less likely to have spontaneous VUR resolution.</p><p>Our management approach is based on the available evidence and individualizes the management based on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of BBD in toilet-trained-age children</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Likelihood of spontaneous resolution</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk of renal scarring</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment of compliance</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preference of parents regarding choice of intervention</p><p/><p>We divide our management approach based on the severity of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67039\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67039 \">figure 1</a>), as increasing severity of VUR is associated with increased risk of febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) recurrence and renal scarring, and a decreased likelihood of spontaneous resolution.

The preference of the family plays a major role in the final therapeutic decision.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surveillance &ndash; In our practice, we consider this approach only in toilet-trained, verbal children, who are able to communicate symptoms in the presence of an infection, and families who understand and will be compliant in following medical instructions for follow-up. The need for prompt recognition of any subsequent urinary infection is emphasized. Additional infections would trigger discussion of either antibiotic prophylaxis or surgical management.

Antibiotic prophylaxis is also given to patients with BBD who are at risk for infection and to patients who are unable to adhere to the requirements of surveillance therapy. (See <a href=\"#H10343204\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic prophylaxis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical correction &ndash; We do not suggest surgical correction as initial therapy for patients with Grade I and II VUR because there is a high likelihood of spontaneous resolution, a low risk of renal scarring, and the long-term risk of renal scarring in patients with surgical correction is similar to that of those treated with medical therapy. If the family desires, we will discuss the success rate, risks, and costs of surgical correction. Surgical correction remains an alternative for those who are not comfortable with either surveillance or continuous prophylaxis. Furthermore, surgical intervention is indicated for patients with persistent VUR who have breakthrough infections on antibiotic prophylaxis. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Surgical treatment'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">THERAPEUTIC OPTIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H587659780\"><span class=\"h2\">Watchful waiting (surveillance)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Watchful waiting consists of a regimen of surveillance and prompt treatment of intercurrent episodes of urinary tract infection (UTI). Families must seek medical attention when there are symptoms suggestive of UTI or unexplained fever. In our practice, watchful waiting is an option for patients with low-grade reflux (Grades I and II (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67039\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67039 \">figure 1</a>)), and who are toilet-trained and able to communicate the presence of UTI symptoms. For patients with high-grade reflux (Grades III to V), children who are not toilet-trained or are not able to communicate symptoms in the presence of an infection, we prefer antibiotic prophylaxis because it is associated with a lower risk of recurrent UTI. (See <a href=\"#H10343204\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic prophylaxis'</a> below.)</p><p>If watchful waiting is selected, family members need to be aware that renal scarring is a potential consequences of recurrent febrile UTI, which may lead to hypertension and chronic kidney disease. The family needs to be vigilant and must seek medical attention whenever there are symptoms suggestive of UTI or unexplained fever. Additional follow-up includes monitoring of VUR and renal scarring. The family's social situation should be assessed for compliance, since surveillance puts the onus on caregivers to promptly recognize a potential UTI and seek medical attention. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> below.)</p><p>Watchful waiting has been promoted as a reasonable management option based on the results of two systematic reviews that reported antibiotic prophylaxis (medical therapy) versus placebo or no treatment did not reduce the risk of UTI or renal scarring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vesicoureteral-reflux/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. However, any conclusion based on these publications needs to be viewed with caution because of the degree of heterogeneity of the studies including significant differences in methodology (eg, definition of UTI, grade of reflux) and study populations (eg, circumcision status, patient age) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vesicoureteral-reflux/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>In contrast, the subsequently published Randomized Intervention for Vesicoureteral Reflux (RIVUR) trial of 607 children (age range: two months to six years) showed a lower risk of recurrent febrile or symptomatic UTI for children assigned to prophylactic antibiotics (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> [TMP-SMX]) versus those assigned to placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vesicoureteral-reflux/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, there was no difference in the incidence of renal scarring between the two groups during the two-year follow-up period. Of note, in this cohort, children with Grade III or IV VUR were more likely to have febrile or symptomatic UTI than those with Grade I or II VUR (23 versus 14 percent). In subgroup analysis, TMP-SMX prophylaxis was associated with a lower risk of recurrent febrile or symptomatic UTI in patients with Grade I or II VUR (hazard ratio [HR] 0.32, 95% CI 0.16-0.61). Antibiotic prophylaxis appeared to be associated with a lower risk of recurrent febrile or symptomatic UTI in patients with Grade III or IV VUR, but this did not reach statistical significance (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.40-1.09).</p><p>A systematic review that included the RIVUR trial also reported similar results that prophylactic antibiotics reduced the risk of febrile and symptomatic UTI in children with VUR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vesicoureteral-reflux/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, there was a higher risk of a UTI due to antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and there appeared to be no effect on the risk of developing renal scars. In this analysis, there was considerable heterogeneity among the studies including study design and quality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10343204\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotic prophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medical therapy for VUR consists of daily prophylactic administration of an antibiotic agent. It is based on the assumptions that use of continuous antibiotics results in sterile urine and the continued reflux of sterile urine does not cause renal damage, and the observation that reflux spontaneously resolves in most cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3433536257\"><span class=\"h3\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In our practice, antibiotic prophylaxis is given to the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients who are not toilet-trained regardless of the severity of VUR</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients with bladder and bowel dysfunction (BBD) regardless of the severity of VUR</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients with high-grade reflux (Grade III to IV)</p><p/><p>As noted above, the best evidence supporting the use of antibiotic prophylaxis versus surveillance is from the RIVUR trial. In this multicenter trial of children diagnosed with VUR, the effectiveness of TMP-SMX and placebo were compared over a two-year follow-up period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vesicoureteral-reflux/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Overall, children in the TMP-SMX group were less likely to have recurrent febrile or symptomatic UTI than those in the placebo group (13 versus 24 percent) (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.34-0.74). In subgroup analysis, antibiotic prophylaxis was most effective in children with BBD (HR 0.21, 95% CI 0.08-0.58) and in children whose first UTI was febrile (HR 0.41, 95% CI 0.26-0.64).</p><p>Data from clinical trials and a systematic review have demonstrated comparable long-term renal outcome (recurrent UTI and scarring) in patients treated with either prophylactic antibiotics or surgical correction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vesicoureteral-reflux/abstract/9,14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,14-17</a>]. In particular, the choice of therapy does not impact the long-term renal outcome in children with severe bilateral disease who are at increased risk for CKD (ie, hypertension, impaired renal function, and in some, end-stage renal disease [ESRD]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vesicoureteral-reflux/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3886348647\"><span class=\"h3\">Agents and dosing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antimicrobial agents most commonly used for prophylaxis include TMP-SMZ, TMP alone, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrofurantoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrofurantoin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vesicoureteral-reflux/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Although the evidence is not conclusive, some experts stop prophylaxis therapy in select older children with persistent VUR, because the risk of recurrent urinary infection diminishes with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vesicoureteral-reflux/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. However, the age of discontinuation is not well-established due to the lack of high-quality data. Furthermore, discontinuation may be dependent upon the social situation and history of compliance. Families need to be counseled regarding prompt diagnosis and treatment of any subsequent infections. Additional infections might require re-imaging to see if VUR is present. If there is recurrent or persistent VUR, antibiotic prophylaxis is resumed and surgical correction may be considered. Finally, adolescent females with persistent VUR should be counseled about the higher risk of pyelonephritis during pregnancy and management options including surgical correction should be reviewed.

In our practice, we selectively obtain DMSA renal scans at the time of presentation in patients with Grade III to V reflux with or without UTI, while others may opt to perform initial baseline scans in all children, even those with lower VUR grades (I and II). It should be noted that while less common, DMSA scan evidence of renal scarring and pyelonephritis has been found in children at presentation with Grades I and II VUR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vesicoureteral-reflux/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients managed by observation alone, evidence of new scarring suggests the need for therapeutic intervention. In patients managed medically, new scarring on prophylaxis suggests that surgical correction should be considered. Follow-up DMSA renal scans can be obtained to document renal involvement after a breakthrough UTI (any UTI while on antibiotic prophylaxis). New renal scarring or evidence of pyelonephritis while on prophylaxis or surveillance without antibiotics would be a reason to suggest a change in management (eg, surgical correction or antibiotic prophylaxis for those managed by surveillance). DMSA renal scans are not routinely repeated in the absence of breakthrough infection, regardless of grade.</p><p/><p>If symptomatic breakthrough infection occurs, a change in the treatment regimen should be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vesicoureteral-reflux/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. As an example, a child who is managed by observation may be changed to prophylactic antibiotics, whereas surgical correction may be considered in a child already on antibiotic prophylaxis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25151731\"><span class=\"h3\">Discontinuation of medical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the paucity of data addressing when medical therapy should be discontinued in patients initially treated with prophylactic antibiotics, indications of when to discontinue medical therapy are uncertain. Some experts will only discontinue therapy when the VCUG is negative. Others will discontinue therapy in older children or adolescents with Grade I reflux who have been infection free for a year or so. In one author's practice (SG), discontinuation of antibiotic prophylaxis is delayed until early adolescence in patients with persistent Grade I reflux. Girls should be made aware that the presence of reflux increases the risk of pyelonephritis during pregnancy and that they should be carefully monitored at that time unless they opt for surgical correction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vesicoureteral-reflux/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although some studies suggest that it is not necessary to document resolution after open surgical repair, in one author's center (SG), a postoperative VCUG or RNC is performed in patients who have undergone surgical correction to determine the success of the procedure. Both renal ultrasound and VCUG are repeated approximately six months after open surgical correction. Renal ultrasounds obtained too soon after correction demonstrate hydronephrosis that is transitory and of no clinical concern. Similarly, a renal ultrasound and VCUG are performed several months after endoscopic correction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vesicoureteral-reflux/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. In other centers, VCUG is not performed unless there is a documented UTI following endoscopic retherapy.</p><p>As discussed above, families whose children have undergone endoscopic therapy must be made aware of the fact that there can be later recurrence of reflux and UTIs, necessitating reimaging and possible retreatment. As a result, we perform cystograms for patients with recurrent febrile UTIs following endoscopic correction. In contrast, open surgical correction of reflux is permanent in close to 100 percent of children. Recurrent UTI in this population is much less likely to be associated with reappearance of reflux, and thus, repeat cystography is not often needed if there is one normal postoperative VCUG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vesicoureteral-reflux/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Long-term follow-up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following the resolution of VUR either spontaneously or surgically, long-term follow-up should be provided for those with renal scarring. The AUA guidelines suggest annual assessments through adolescence, which include measurements of growth (height and weight) and blood pressure, and urinalysis to detect proteinuria or bacteria. Families should be aware of the potential patient complications of hypertension and impaired renal function, and the increased risk of VUR in first-degree relatives.</p><p>The frequency, utility, and method of detecting renal scarring have not been clearly defined. DMSA renal scan is the most sensitive measure for detecting renal scarring. Renal ultrasound is not as sensitive in detecting renal scars as DMSA scan, and as a result has not been as useful in follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vesicoureteral-reflux/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. However, a renal ultrasound performed every two or three years may be helpful to monitor renal growth, especially for patients with significant scarring. The need for DMSA renal scan is determined on a case-by-case basis, dictated by if information would affect clinical management. For example, nephrectomy may be considered for a patient with severe hypertension if the DMSA renal scan demonstrates a significant differential function with the affected kidney demonstrating less than 10 to 15 percent function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

(See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following surgical correction, a renal ultrasound should be performed to assess for obstruction. In many centers, a cystogram may also be performed to demonstrate a successful operative outcome. In addition, reimaging should be considered in patients who undergo endoscopic correction, given the lower success rate, and certainly if there is subsequent recurrence of febrile UTIs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term follow-up includes annual assessment of linear growth, measurement of blood pressure, and urinalysis. Families should be aware of the association of VUR with increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) (eg, hypertension, renal impairment, or proteinuria). (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Long-term follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H287708477\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Gordon McLorie, MD, FRCSC, FAAP, and John Herrin, MBBS, FRACP, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vesicoureteral-reflux/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Shaikh N, Hoberman A, Keren R, et al.
