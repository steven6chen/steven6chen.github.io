Some authors have noted that a target network with dots, globules, or blood vessels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F97252\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97252 \">picture 9</a>) is a more distinctive feature of CMN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-melanocytic-nevi/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Dermoscopic features detected in CMN of the palms and soles include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-melanocytic-nevi/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>] the parallel furrow pattern which is also common in acquired acral nevi (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F89403\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89403 \">picture 10</a>).

Small congenital nevi may be difficult to distinguish from acquired nevi if history is uncertain. However, dermoscopic examination may be helpful in differentiating small CMN from atypical CMN. </p><p>The differential diagnosis of medium-sized or large CMN may include a plexiform neurofibroma. A plexiform neurofibroma is favored if the lesion has a &quot;bag of worms&quot; texture on palpation or if there are other findings suggestive of neurofibromatosis-1. The major entities in the differential diagnosis of a small or medium-sized CMN are a smooth muscle hamartoma and mastocytoma. Dermoscopy, presence of a Darier sign, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> biopsy may be helpful in the latter situation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mastocytosis (cutaneous and systemic): Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CMN enlarge in proportion to the child's growth, with estimated size increase factors from infancy to adulthood as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-melanocytic-nevi/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Head &ndash; 1.7-fold</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trunk and upper extremities &ndash; 2.8-fold</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower extremities &ndash; 3.3-fold</p><p/><p>CMN tend to grow more rapidly during early infancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-melanocytic-nevi/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In addition to increasing in size, CMN undergo other age-related changes in appearance. They often begin as flat, evenly pigmented patches that later become elevated with a pebbly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62970\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62970 \">picture 2</a>), verrucous, or cerebriform surface and darker, lighter, mottled, or speckled pigmentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-melanocytic-nevi/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Dermal melanocytes within CMN may undergo peripheral nerve sheath differentiation, or neurotization, which results in the development of soft nodules and large plexiform neurofibroma-like plaques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-melanocytic-nevi/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>CMN located on the scalp may have a particular tendency to gradually lighten and regress over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-melanocytic-nevi/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The halo phenomenon (ie, the development of a depigmented halo around the nevus), which is more commonly observed with acquired melanocytic nevi, represents another means by which CMN in any site can regress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-melanocytic-nevi/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In some cases, the development of halo nevus depigmentation is preceded by the development of dermatitis on <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> around the nevus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-melanocytic-nevi/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>During the neonatal period, transient erosions or ulcerations may arise at sites of obvious friction within medium-sized and large CMN as a reflection of increased skin fragility. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H765115\"><span class=\"h2\">Proliferative nodules</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proliferative nodules are benign melanocytic proliferations that occasionally develop within large or giant CMN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-melanocytic-nevi/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. They may be congenital or appear during infancy or childhood. Because of their rapid growth and clinical characteristics such as firmness or ulceration, biopsy is usually performed to exclude melanoma. However, distinction from melanoma on histologic examination may prove difficult because of the presence of large, atypical melanocytes and mitoses. This is a situation where evaluation by experienced dermatopathologists is essential, and techniques such as comparative genomic hybridization or mass spectroscopy imaging proteomic analysis may be helpful (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F94602\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef94602 \">picture 13</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-melanocytic-nevi/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].

Melanomas most often occur after puberty and tend to arise at the dermal-epidermal junction, in contrast to the earlier onset and deeper origin of many melanomas arising within large CMN. </p><p>For patients with large or giant CMN, the risk of developing melanoma (cutaneous or extracutaneous) is estimated to be approximately 2 to 5 percent over a lifetime, with approximately one-half of this risk during the first five years of life (ie, one-half of the melanomas that develop occur by three to five years of age) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66620\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66620 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-melanocytic-nevi/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. In a cohort study including 349 children with CMN (145 with large CMN), five (3.4 percent) developed a fatal melanoma at one to seven years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-melanocytic-nevi/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In all cases, the projected adult size of the nevus was &gt;60 cm and satellite nevi were present at birth.</p><p>Particularly in large or giant CMN, cutaneous melanomas can arise subepidermally, making early recognition difficult. Palpation of the entire nevus surface is an important part of the physical exam to try to detect deep nodules. In some patients, the site of the primary melanoma is the central nervous system (CNS) or retroperitoneum, whereas others have no identifiable primary site. Patients with a &quot;giant&quot; (&gt;40 cm) CMN in a posterior axial location that is associated with numerous satellite nevi have the greatest risk of developing melanoma. Melanomas less often arise within nevi restricted to the head or an extremity; to date, no well-documented, primary cutaneous melanomas have been reported to develop within satellite nevi themselves.

NCM encompasses both leptomeningeal melanosis and CNS melanosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-melanocytic-nevi/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. NCM may be asymptomatic (noted on screening magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) or symptomatic.

However, the latter might be removed for cosmetic reasons, and the former may spontaneously lighten during childhood.</p><p>Periodic evaluation of small- and medium-sized CMN is most important after puberty, since the risk of melanoma arising within these lesions during childhood is extremely low. Baseline photographs can be helpful, and dermoscopy represents a useful tool for assessing changes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dermoscopic-evaluation-of-skin-lesions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dermoscopic evaluation of skin lesions&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients and parents should be instructed to perform skin self-examinations and to bring focal<em> </em>changes in color, border, or topography (eg, a red or black papule, nodule, or crust) to the clinician's attention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-and-early-detection-of-melanoma-in-adults-and-adolescents#H4099425328\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening and early detection of melanoma in adults and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Patient self-examination'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Large CMN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early surgical removal is often desired for large CMN because of their cosmetic and psychosocial sequelae and concern for possible malignant transformation. Complete excision is difficult to achieve; however, resection of bulky and cumbersome portions of large CMN can be beneficial for some patients. Elimination of every nevus cell may be impossible because of the large area of skin affected, the anatomic site (eg, distal extremity, periocular area, genitalia), and involvement of deeper structures (eg, fat, fascia, muscle). Even theoretically complete surgical excision cannot completely eliminate future risk of melanoma, as some melanomas in these patients may develop in the CNS or retroperitoneum. In many cases, close clinical observation with no surgical removal of the lesion is a reasonable choice. </p><p>Factors that affect the decision to perform surgery as well as to determine the timing of surgery include the size and location of the large CMN, the technical difficulty of the procedure(s) required, and anesthesia options. When possible, complete removal of large CMN usually necessitates staged excision with the use of tissue expanders and, occasionally, skin grafting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-melanocytic-nevi/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. </p><p>When surgical excision is not feasible, cosmetic benefit may potentially be obtained from procedures such as curettage, dermabrasion, and ablative laser therapy (eg, carbon dioxide or erbium:yttrium aluminum garnet lasers, sometimes combined with pigment-directed lasers). During the neonatal period, there is a lower risk of excessive scarring following such interventions, and nevus cells are more accessible because they are concentrated in the upper dermis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-melanocytic-nevi/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. Curettage can be performed during the first two weeks of life, taking advantage of a cleavage plane between the upper and mid-dermis exclusive to neonatal skin. However, nevus cells remain in the dermis after all of these procedures, as evidenced by frequent repigmentation as well as several reports of the subsequent development of melanoma in treated areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-melanocytic-nevi/abstract/48-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-52</a>]. This underscores the need for lifelong clinical observation.</p><p>Regardless of the treatments employed, patients with large CMN (or scars after their excision) should be followed with periodic skin and general physical examinations. Palpation of the nevus <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> scars is essential for detection of focal induration. Histologic evaluation is indicated for firm nodules or areas with other suspicious changes, as described above. Even theoretically complete removal of a large CMN does not eliminate the risk of melanoma, since melanoma of the CNS and other visceral primary sites (eg, the retroperitoneum) may still occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-melanocytic-nevi/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. </p><p>Proliferative nodules that develop within large CMN during infancy can have histologic features of melanoma yet behave in a benign manner. Techniques such as comparative genomic hybridization can help to distinguish proliferative nodules (usually having no chromosomal aberrations or only numeric changes) from melanoma (typically demonstrating <span class=\"nowrap\">gains/losses</span> of chromosomal fragments) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-melanocytic-nevi/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Mass spectroscopy imaging proteomic analysis may also help differentiate proliferative nodules from melanoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-melanocytic-nevi/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H765115\" class=\"local\">'Proliferative nodules'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Surveillance for neurocutaneous melanosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a large CMN plus multiple (especially &gt;20) satellite nevi or with multiple medium-sized CMN are at risk for NCM and should be followed with serial head circumference measurements, neurologic examinations, and developmental assessments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-melanocytic-nevi/abstract/3,37,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,37,39</a>]. This monitoring includes evaluation for signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, mass lesions, and spinal cord compression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-melanocytic-nevi/abstract/3,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,39</a>]. </p><p>Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain and spine should be performed in any high-risk patient exhibiting neurologic symptoms, and we suggest that asymptomatic high-risk patients also be screened for NCM with gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the brain and spine, ideally during the first six months of life before myelination, which may obscure evidence of melanosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-melanocytic-nevi/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. For very young infants, it may be possible to obtain initial high-quality MRI images without general anesthesia using &quot;feed and wrap&quot; techniques that allow a swaddled infant to sleep during the imaging procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-melanocytic-nevi/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>Given the poor prognosis, aggressive surgical procedures for CMN removal should be postponed in patients with symptomatic NCM. NCM in an asymptomatic patient does not necessarily preclude skin surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECKLED LENTIGINOUS NEVUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Speckled lentiginous nevus (SLN) or nevus spilus is a hyperpigmented, macular, patch-type, tan or light brown patch with superimposed darker brown macules and papules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64780%7EDERM%2F94650\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64780 graphicRef94650 \">picture 14A-B</a>). The &quot;background&quot; tan patch (caf&eacute;-au-lait macule-like) of an SLN is usually noted at birth or soon after, with brown &quot;spots&quot; appearing within the lesion over time. </p><p>The superimposed, pigmented macules and papules can range from lentigines to junctional, compound, and intradermal nevi to Spitz nevi and blue nevi. There are two distinct subtypes of SLN: those with only macular speckles and those with papular as well as macular speckles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-melanocytic-nevi/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Several lines of evidence suggest that SLN, which have a prevalence of approximately 2 percent, represent a subtype of CMN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-melanocytic-nevi/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Some SLN have patterns of distribution reflecting embryonic development (eg, block-like with a sharp demarcation at the midline or following the lines of Blaschko).</p><p>The risk of developing melanoma in SLN is thought to be similar to classic CMN of the same size range. SLN should therefore be followed clinically with periodic examinations and biopsy of suspicious areas.
