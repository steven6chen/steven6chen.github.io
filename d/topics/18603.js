This injury is called ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and can result in pulmonary edema, barotrauma, and worsening hypoxemia that can prolong mechanical ventilation, lead to multi-system organ dysfunction, and increase mortality. Thus, adopting a ventilator strategy that reduces VILI is an important goal in ventilatory management.</p><p>The incidence, mechanisms, diagnostic evaluation, and management of VILI are discussed in this topic review. Other complications of mechanical ventilation, including barotrauma, are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiologic-and-pathophysiologic-consequences-of-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiologic and pathophysiologic consequences of mechanical ventilation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-management-and-prevention-of-pulmonary-barotrauma-during-invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis, management, and prevention of pulmonary barotrauma during invasive mechanical ventilation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1645080884\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS (VILI, VALI)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI) are defined below. Barotrauma is a form of VILI that is associated with alveolar rupture due to elevated transalveolar pressure; this form of VILI is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-management-and-prevention-of-pulmonary-barotrauma-during-invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults#H2780826784\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis, management, and prevention of pulmonary barotrauma during invasive mechanical ventilation in adults&quot;, section on 'Definition'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VILI &ndash; VILI is an acute lung injury affecting the airways and parenchyma that is caused by or exacerbated by mechanical ventilation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VALI &ndash; In clinical practice, it is often difficult to determine if the lung injury that a patient has developed was caused by the ventilatory pattern or was due to the patient's worsening underlying lung condition. As such, the term VALI is often used if a causative relationship between lung injury and the mechanical ventilator cannot be proven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventilator-induced-lung-injury/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p/><p>Many experts consider VILI as the &quot;process&quot; of injury while VALI is the end result (ie, the condition). However, despite different definitions, the terms are often used interchangeably.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H77257600\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) is mostly seen in patients ventilated for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) but over the past few years, it has become clear that it also occurs in patients ventilated for reasons other than ARDS. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ARDS patients &ndash; Because the manifestations of VILI are virtually indistinguishable from ARDS, the true incidence is unknown but presumed to be higher than in patients without ARDS. Patients with ARDS are at risk of further lung injury because the lung is already injured (&quot;primed&quot;). In addition, the underlying pathophysiology of ARDS predisposes the lung to further injury from overdistension (because large portions of the lung are unavailable for ventilation) and from atelectrauma. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-ARDS patients &ndash; The incidence of VILI in ventilated non-ARDS patients is also unknown. In an observational study of 332 mechanically ventilated patients who were intubated for non-ARDS causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventilator-induced-lung-injury/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], risk factors for subsequent VILI included high tidal volumes (&gt;6 mL per kg of predicted body weight), blood product transfusions, acidemia (pH &lt;7.35), and restrictive lung disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventilator-induced-lung-injury/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. It is probable that similar risk factors exist in patients with ARDS.</p><p/><p>It is thought that genetic variations place patients at increased risk for lung injury, although none are currently used as markers or therapeutic targets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventilator-induced-lung-injury/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alveolar overdistension, atelectrauma, and biotrauma are the principal mechanisms of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) during mechanical ventilation, although the relative importance of each mechanism is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventilator-induced-lung-injury/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Alveolar injury results in high alveolar permeability, interstitial and alveolar edema, alveolar hemorrhage, hyaline membranes, loss of functional surfactant, and alveolar collapse (ie, findings similar to those observed in acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventilator-induced-lung-injury/abstract/1,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9,10</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Alveolar overdistension (volutrauma)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Volutrauma represents lung injury caused as lung units are overdistended with increased transpulmonary pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventilator-induced-lung-injury/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Animal studies have demonstrated that high tidal volumes (or high lung volumes), rather than high airway pressure per se, cause lung injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F69085\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69085 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F69228\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69228 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventilator-induced-lung-injury/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. In patients intubated for reasons other than ARDS, overdistension from high tidal volumes has also been shown to increase the risk for VILI (odds ratio 1.3, 95% CI 1.12-1.51, for each mL above 6 mL per kg of ideal body weight) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventilator-induced-lung-injury/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, avoiding overdistension by using low tidal volume strategies is beneficial in patients with ARDS, the details of which are provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanical ventilation of adults in acute respiratory distress syndrome&quot;, section on 'Low tidal volume ventilation'</a>.)</p><p>Large tidal volumes are not always required for alveolar overdistension. When there is heterogeneous consolidation or atelectasis (eg, patient with ARDS), a disproportionate volume from each breath is delivered to the open alveoli. This can cause regional alveolar overdistension and VILI despite delivery of conventional tidal volumes that are based upon body weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventilator-induced-lung-injury/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A similar process is at play when lung compliance is reduced such as severe fibrosis or during single lung ventilation when a tidal breath is distributed to only one lung as opposed to two.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Atelectrauma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Animal models have demonstrated that cyclic alveolar expansion (during inspiration) and collapse (during expiration) creates shear forces that distend and cause injury to adjacent alveoli and airways (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F52485\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52485 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventilator-induced-lung-injury/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. Specifically, non-atelectatic alveoli are exposed to the injurious impact of neighboring atelectatic alveoli that are opening and collapsing during tidal breathing. This process is referred to as cyclical atelectasis, or atelectrauma. Strategies aimed at limiting atelectrauma (eg, high positive end-expiratory pressure and open lung ventilation) have had mixed effects in human trials and are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanical ventilation of adults in acute respiratory distress syndrome&quot;, section on 'Open lung ventilation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3825445484\"><span class=\"h2\">Biotrauma (inflammation)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biotrauma is characterized by ventilator-induced release of inflammatory mediators from cells within the injured lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventilator-induced-lung-injury/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. Both alveolar overdistension and atelectrauma have been shown in animals to result in an increase in inflammatory mediators (from neutrophils, macrophages, and likely alveolar epithelial cells) including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-kB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventilator-induced-lung-injury/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>]. In patients with ARDS, similar inflammatory mediators are elevated and several randomized trials that show a mortality benefit to low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV), also report a concurrent reduction in lavage and serum cytokines with LTVV strategies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventilator-induced-lung-injury/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Another study demonstrated that the changes in serum cytokine levels can occur within one hour of a change in ventilatory strategy, suggesting that even relatively short periods of injurious ventilation may be deleterious [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventilator-induced-lung-injury/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. There is also evidence that injurious ventilatory strategies may lead to the subsequent development of pulmonary fibrosis (in animals) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventilator-induced-lung-injury/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>] and to the development of multi-organ failure (in humans) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventilator-induced-lung-injury/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>], although the precise mechanisms are unclear. However, many of the strategies that target inflammation in <span class=\"nowrap\">ARDS/VILI</span> have not been successful.

Patients become more tachypneic and tachycardic. The chest radiograph typically shows new or increased bilateral interstitial or alveolar opacities of any severity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F53014\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53014 \">image 1</a>). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest demonstrates heterogeneous consolidation and atelectasis, as well as focal hyperlucent areas that represent overdistended lung (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F71931\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef71931 \">image 2</a>). VALI may also be associated with new organ failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventilator-induced-lung-injury/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Clinical features and diagnosis in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3961670384\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>VALI is a clinical diagnosis based upon the features described above (see <a href=\"#H910120748\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above) and the exclusion of alternative causes of respiratory deterioration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ARDS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F58759\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58759 \">table 1</a>) in mechanically ventilated patients.

However, there are some features that are different, the details of which are discussed in this section. New pulmonary infection and pulmonary edema are the most common etiologies that need to be distinguished. However, additional etiologies that occur as a consequence of being critically-ill or mechanically ventilated also need to be considered; these include sepsis, aspiration, barotrauma, auto-positive end-expiratory pressure (auto-PEEP), drug or transfusion reactions, venous, fat, air, or amniotic fluid embolism, intra-abdominal distension, endotracheal tube displacement, lobar collapse, pleural effusion, and acute coronary syndromes. We suggest the following general approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be re-examined looking for new bronchospasm and crackles (suggesting pulmonary edema), reduced air entry (suggesting a pneumothorax or pulmonary effusion), lower extremity swelling (suggesting fluid overload or venous thrombosis), abdominal swelling (suggesting ascites, ileus, or intra-abdominal hypertension).

Further testing should be targeted at the suspected etiology and may include computed tomography (CT) chest, blood and other body fluids culture, echocardiography, lower extremity Doppler studies, and rarely CT pulmonary angiography, bronchoscopy, or lung biopsy.

Atelectrauma is generally managed using applied positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), although the optimal way to set the ideal level of PEEP is not clear.
