They can be lighter or darker than the skin around them. Some warts have tiny black dots in them, often called seeds. Warts can appear alone or in groups that join and form patches.</p><p>Different types of warts affect different parts of the body:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common skin warts can show up anywhere on the skin but most often affect the fingers, hands, knees, and elbows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F78884\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78884 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When common warts are found around the fingernails, they are called &quot;periungual&quot; warts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F62677\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62677 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plantar warts are found on the soles (bottoms) of the feet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F91858\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91858 \">picture 3</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flat warts are usually found on the back of the hands, face, and lower legs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F91859%7EDERM%2F91860\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91859 graphicRef91860 \">picture 4A-B</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H483560004\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes skin warts?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Warts are caused by germs called viruses. You can get infected with the virus that causes warts by touching another person's wart. You can also get infected by touching objects that have the virus on them. For instance, people can catch warts by walking barefoot around pools, locker rooms, or gyms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H483560011\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse about my wart?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should see a doctor or nurse if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You are not sure that what you have is a wart</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your wart does not go away with home treatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You would like to use home treatment, but are not sure which treatment is right for you</p><p/><p>Not everyone needs treatment for warts. Some warts go away on their own within 2 years. But warts can also get bigger or spread, so many people decide to treat their warts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4235637531\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to get rid of warts?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can try something called &quot;salicylic acid.&quot; This is a mild acid that you put on warts. It is sold in drugstores and comes in different forms, such as a liquid or patch. If you decide to try salicylic acid, follow the directions on the label. But do not use this treatment if you have a form of nerve damage called &quot;neuropathy.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H483560039\"><span class=\"h1\">How do doctors and nurses treat warts?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors and nurses have a few ways to treat warts. They often suggest combining the treatments they use with an at-home treatment, like salicylic acid.</p><p>Some of the things a doctor or nurse can do to treat warts are: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Freeze the wart off with a special fluid that gets very cold (called liquid nitrogen)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treat the wart with a medicine called <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cantharidin-united-states-not-available-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">cantharidin</a> that destroys warts. This treatment is not painful at first, but it sometimes causes pain, blisters, and swelling shortly after use.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shave the wart off with a knife (after numbing the skin)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prescribe a skin cream that helps the body get rid of warts</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inject the wart with a medicine that helps the body fight the virus that causes warts</p><p/><p>If you have one of these treatments, ask your doctor or nurse what to expect after treatment. That way, if your skin starts to hurt or turns red you will know if it is normal. But if your skin starts to form pus, you should call your doctor or nurse right away.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H483560046\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=skin-warts-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Skin warts (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=corns-and-calluses-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Corns and calluses (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
