In one large study, the incidence of reactions to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (TMP-SMX) was 34 per 1000 patients exposed, compared with 51 per 1000 for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfonamide-allergy-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, the adverse reactions caused by sulfonamides differ significantly from those attributed to beta-lactams, and the evaluation and management of sulfonamide reactions are distinct. The pathophysiology of allergic (or hypersensitivity) reactions to sulfonamides is complex and poorly understood.</p><p>This topic review describes the most prevalent types of reactions to sulfonamides, the evaluation of patients with reported allergy, and cross-reactivity issues. Management options for patients with past reactions who require similar medications again are also presented. Most of the available literature concerns allergic reactions to antimicrobial sulfonamides, particularly TMP-SMX. However, reactions to nonantimicrobial sulfonamides (eg, diuretics, sulfonylureas, and others) and sulfones (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a>) will be briefly addressed as well.</p><p>This review does not address the treatment of acute drug reactions. These are presented elsewhere, according to specific type of reaction.

This term has contributed to ongoing confusion about relevant cross-reactivity among sulfonamide drugs. It is preferable to avoid &quot;sulfa allergy&quot; and instead document the specific medication that caused the adverse reaction and the symptoms that were involved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Types of sulfonamides</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sulfonamide medications are drugs that contain a sulfonamide moiety (SO<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfonamide-allergy-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

The antimicrobial sulfonamides share two essential functional groups: an arylamine (an amine group linked to a benzene ring at N4) and an aromatic (N-containing) 5 or 6 member ring attached to the sulfonamide core as an N1 substituent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F61834\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61834 \">figure 1</a>). The presence of both moieties is essential to their mechanism of antimicrobial action (ie, as an analog of para-aminobenzoic acid) and is also believed central to the pathogenesis of hypersensitivity reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfonamide-allergy-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The only agents that contain both moieties and produce the reactive intermediates implicated in hypersensitivity are the antimicrobial sulfonamides (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F61834\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61834 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F59357\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59357 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfonamide-allergy-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Nonantimicrobial sulfonamides</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The agents in this group include diuretics, hypoglycemics, anti-inflammatories, and antihypertensive agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrochlorothiazide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetazolamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetazolamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sumatriptan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sumatriptan</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glyburide-glibenclamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glyburide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F57629\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57629 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfonamide-allergy-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Signs and symptoms are variable and may include erythema, maculopapular or morbilliform rash, urticaria, and pruritus. Most of these reactions appear within the first three days of therapy and resolve promptly after drug discontinuation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfonamide-allergy-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The mechanisms responsible are unknown in most cases.</p><p>The following should be noted, since cutaneous findings may be part of more serious types of reactions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of fever or any systemic symptoms should be assumed to represent the beginning of a more significant systemic reaction.

In some patients, this progresses to multisystem organ involvement and dysfunction. Severity can range from mild to severe to fatal. Sulfonamide antimicrobials (usually <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> [TMP-SMX]) are most commonly implicated in this type of reaction, although nonantimicrobial sulfonamides are occasionally causative.</p><p>Symptoms generally develop one to two weeks after the start of administration, with fever usually appearing first, sometimes accompanied by malaise and pharyngitis. Peripheral blood smear may reveal an atypical lymphocytosis or eosinophilia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfonamide-allergy-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/2,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9</a>]. Organ involvement may be asymptomatic or overt, and can include hepatitis, nephritis, pulmonary infiltrates, and cytopenias. Symptoms generally resolve one to two weeks after discontinuation.

Nonantimicrobial sulfonamides have also been implicated, but not convincingly documented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfonamide-allergy-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>For sulfonamides, the relevant drug antigen is usually not the intact drug itself.

The clinical presentation of aseptic meningitis involves fever and headache, sometimes accompanied by nausea and vomiting, change in mental status, photophobia, or stiff neck. Patients may display a range of other neurologic and systemic symptoms and signs. In a literature review of 41 cases, most patients developed symptoms to the combination of TMP and SMX, although cases were identified that were triggered by TMP alone or SMX alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfonamide-allergy-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Evaluation of the cerebrospinal fluid typically showed elevated white blood cells (usually in the range of 100 to <span class=\"nowrap\">1000/mcL),</span> with neutrophil predominance, elevated protein, and normal glucose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfonamide-allergy-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. After the drug was discontinued, patients began to improve within 24 hours, with resolution of the headache within two to three days. Several case reports exist of patients who were challenged to TMP alone after reacting to TMP-SMX and experienced recurrent symptoms. Of the 15 patients in the review who received the TMP-SMX again, 91 percent developed symptoms within 6 hours, and all did within 24 hours, even when the initial reaction developed after days to weeks of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfonamide-allergy-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

It is unclear if there is cross-reactivity between sulfones and sulfonamide antimicrobials, but it seems prudent to avoid both types of agents whenever possible in patients who have had serious reactions (eg, Stevens-Johnson <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/toxic</span> epidermal necrolysis <span class=\"nowrap\">[SJS/TEN],</span> rash with fever and systemic symptoms, serum sickness, or hemolytic anemia) to one or the other.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Among nonantimicrobial sulfonamides</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The nonantimicrobial sulfonamides have been associated with far fewer immunologic reactions.

The choice of strategy depends upon the type and severity of the past reaction, and on the risks and benefits of alternative treatments. (See <a href=\"#H34\" class=\"local\">'Patients with previous morbilliform rash (+/- fever)'</a> below and <a href=\"#H37\" class=\"local\">'Patients with previous SJS or TEN'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Avoidance</strong> &ndash; Use of an alternative medication of a distinct pharmacologic class is obviously the safest and simplest option in most patients with past sulfonamide reactions. Avoidance is the only safe approach if a patient describes symptoms consistent with any type of blistering dermatitis or diffuse erythroderma. These patients should almost never undergo test dosing or desensitization, except in very unusual circumstances. Case series have noted that Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) can recur and may be more severe with even minor re-exposures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfonamide-allergy-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Test dosing</strong> &ndash; Test dosing (or graded drug challenge) is a term used to describe the cautious administration of small and increasing doses of a medication under medical observation. Test dosing is appropriate for patients who are <strong>unlikely</strong> to be allergic to the drug in question. It does not alter the patient's immune response to the drug, so patients who tolerate a graded challenge prove that they are not allergic to that drug.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The starting dose used is influenced by the severity and remoteness of the past reaction, and may range from one-thousandth to one-tenth of the therapeutic dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfonamide-allergy-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/51,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,53</a>]. This amount is then gradually increased by 3- to 10-fold at each step. The steps are administered at time intervals that are long enough to allow for the development of symptoms, and these intervals are determined by the nature of the past reaction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As an example, a patient who had previously developed a maculopapular rash in response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrochlorothiazide</a> and now required <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glyburide-glibenclamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glyburide</a> would be an appropriate candidate for test dosing, as cross-sensitivity between these two nonantimicrobial sulfonamides is unlikely, but not impossible. If the patient reports that the rash to hydrochlorothiazide had appeared within two to four hours of the last administered dose, then it would be appropriate to give test doses at intervals of six to eight hours, beginning at one-tenth of the target dose. In this example, a relatively large initial dose is acceptable, because the original reaction to hydrochlorothiazide was not severe.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Desensitization</strong> &ndash; The term desensitization is used to describe the cautious administration of small and increasing doses of a medication under careful medical observation to patients who are <strong>likely</strong> to be allergic to the drug in question. Desensitization alters the patient's underlying response to the drug, although only temporarily, as long as there is uninterrupted exposure to the medication. Desensitization is appropriate when there are no acceptable alternative medications. Desensitization is most often used in patients with immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated, type I hypersensitivity reactions, although in the case of sulfonamide drugs, protocols have been developed for use in patients with the more common presentation of rash and fever. (See <a href=\"#H40\" class=\"local\">'Desensitization'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27348531\"><span class=\"h2\">Precautions with any form of re-exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Consultation with an allergy specialist experienced in adverse drug reactions is recommended if either test dosing or desensitization are under consideration, unless the clinician is specifically experienced with these procedures. Precautions regarding both test dosing and desensitization include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>These procedures are performed immediately before required treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medications are administered without premedication, which could obscure detection of early and mild allergic symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Documentation of informed consent, including a thorough discussion of risks and benefits of the procedure, is essential.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with previous morbilliform rash (+/- fever)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most patients with fever and nonblistering rash in response to a sulfonamide drug in the past, the use of chemically distinct medication is the most prudent option. However, if there is no equivalent alternative medication and another sulfonamide medication is required, then both test dosing and desensitization may be considered. These situations require clinical judgment and clear communication with the patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35\"><span class=\"h3\">Needing a sulfonamide from a different group</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is minimal evidence for cross-reactivity between sulfonamides antimicrobials and nonantimicrobials, as previously discussed (see <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Cross-reactivity'</a> above). Thus, for patients requiring a drug from the other group (eg, a patient requiring <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> who had a past rash and fever to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> [TMP-SMX]), there are two options for treatment:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Simply give the drug normally &ndash; This is appropriate in a patient who does <strong>not</strong> have multiple drug allergies and whose past reaction to the sulfonamide from the other group was limited to morbilliform rash, or rash and fever.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administration of one or more test doses of the desired drug &ndash; This is our preferred approach for the patient with multiple drug allergies, as this clinical history identifies a subset of patients at higher risk for drug reactions in general. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Confounding in studies of cross-reactivity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>The specific test dose protocol would be based upon the patient's past reaction. If the original reaction involved delayed-onset rash, initial test doses can be repeated for several days without dose escalation in order to ensure that any reactions have sufficient time to develop. As an example, a patient with past hypersensitivity to TMP-SMX who required <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> could take one-half of the lowest strength tablet available, once daily for a week, as an initial test dose. Even lower initial test doses can be obtained by diluting commercially-available oral solutions. If no symptoms developed, then the patient could be advanced stepwise to the full therapeutic dose.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36\"><span class=\"h3\">Needing a sulfonamide from the same group</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several potential clinical scenarios that may arise in which a patient with a past sulfonamide reaction requires an agent from the same group of sulfonamides, and no equivalent alternative drug can be identified.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>TMP-SMX allergy in a patient needing TMP-SMX again</strong> &ndash; Desensitization is appropriate in this setting. Desensitization to TMP-SMX is best studied in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients, although the authors and editors have performed TMP-SMX desensitization in HIV-uninfected patients with similar success.

Case series have noted that SJS and TEN can recur with even minor re-exposures and may be more severe the second time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfonamide-allergy-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H38\"><span class=\"h3\">Needing a sulfonamide from a different group</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our practice is to avoid all sulfonamides and sulfones in patients with past SJS or TEN. However, rare situations may arise in which a sulfonamide from a different group is needed for a life-threatening condition. Consultation with an allergy specialist experienced in adverse drug reactions would be essential in this setting. One report described successful reintroduction of a sulfonamide diuretic in a patient with SJS to TMP-SMX years earlier and uncomplicated rashes with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glyburide-glibenclamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glyburide</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfonamide-allergy-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. He was treated for several years with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethacrynic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ethacrynic acid</a>, but this drug then became temporarily unavailable and his heart failure progressed. After giving informed consent, the patient received a graded challenge using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=torsemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">torsemide</a>, which was chosen because it was structurally more different from furosemide, compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bumetanide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bumetanide</a>. He was initially given torsemide 2.5 mg daily for one week. The dose was then increased to 10 mg daily over the next six weeks. He did not diurese adequately at this dose, so the dose was increased to 40 mg daily over the ensuing month. The patient developed no allergic symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H39\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with past anaphylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with past reactions consistent with IgE-mediated allergy or anaphylaxis (ie, hives, angioedema, bronchospasm, laryngeal edema, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypotension), the causative drug should be avoided. In addition, all sulfonamides within the same group should also be avoided. As an example, a patient who experienced apparent anaphylaxis with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> should not be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrochlorothiazide</a> or other sulfonamide diuretics. If such therapy is essential, then a desensitization protocol designed for type I, IgE-mediated allergy should be employed under the guidance of an allergy specialist. (See <a href=\"#H40\" class=\"local\">'Desensitization'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40\"><span class=\"h1\">DESENSITIZATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term desensitization is used to describe the cautious administration of small and increasing doses of a medication under careful medical observation to patients in whom allergic reactions are considered <strong>probable</strong>. Desensitization may be attempted for some types of reactions when there are no medically acceptable alternatives.</p><p>The term desensitization usually refers to procedures designed to allow patients with a history of type I (immunoglobulin E [IgE]-mediated, immediate type hypersensitivity) drug allergy to <strong>temporarily</strong> tolerate readministration of a medication, such as penicillin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfonamide-allergy-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Patients must continue to take the medication regularly (usually at least daily) following a successful desensitization procedure. Because of the temporary nature of the effect, the term &quot;hyposensitization&quot; is preferred by some allergy experts.</p><p>Protocols have also been developed for a small number of other medication reactions that result from non IgE-mediated immunologic mechanisms, including sulfonamide sensitivity involving delayed maculopapular rashes and fever. Unfortunately, these procedures for non IgE-mediated skin rashes are also called desensitizations, despite the lack of evidence that any immune cell (eg, T lymphocyte) is downregulated as a result of the process. Despite these uncertainties, desensitization is the commonly-used term for sulfonamide re-exposure protocols, and this review uses the term as well. These protocols may appear to be successful in large part because many patients lose immunologic sensitivity over time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H41\"><span class=\"h2\">Protocols for past rash/fever</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The protocols described in this section are intended to be performed in patients with past morbilliform rash with or without fever, for whom there is no equivalent alternative treatment.</p><p>Drug desensitization protocols vary, although all are based upon administering increasing doses of medication in an uninterrupted and stepwise manner, beginning with very low doses. The protocols presented here have been performed successfully by the author, although modifications may be made based on characteristics of the individual case. In most cases, these modifications are made to escalate the dose more slowly. Clinicians should avoid altering successful protocols to render them faster or significantly change the time interval between doses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H42\"><span class=\"h3\">Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a significant number of published desensitization protocols for use in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients requiring <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (TMP-SMX), 11 of which were compared in detail in a review on drug desensitization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfonamide-allergy-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The efficacy of these protocols has not been compared in head-to-head studies and the optimal approach has not been determined. Most of the published TMP-SMX desensitization trials have used the oral route, as this is presumed safer than intravenous (IV) administration.</p><p>Two prospective trials of TMP-SMX desensitization are presented in detail here [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfonamide-allergy-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/42,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,62</a>]. Both were performed in HIV-positive patients who required pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis and had a history of TMP-SMX associated fever or nonblistering skin rash.

By day three, subjects were receiving a full (single strength) TMP-SMX tablet, and 77 percent of those undergoing this regimen were able to tolerate the course of therapy for a mean of 16 months without adverse effects. Eleven subjects failed to complete the course of therapy, with eight stopping within the first two days. One patient experienced hypotension and acute nonfatal myocardial infarction. Higher relative and absolute CD4 counts were associated with trends towards higher risk of failure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study of 22 patients used a longer nine-day protocol, which was successful in 87 percent of patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F51870\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51870 \">table 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfonamide-allergy-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Reactions occurred in eight individuals (36 percent). All of these reactions consisted of mild to moderate rash or fever, which resolved after a brief course of systemic glucocorticoid treatment. There were no episodes of hypotension or anaphylaxis.</p><p/><p>We initiate all desensitization protocols under medical supervision. For patients with mild fever <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> morbilliform rash in the past, we typically administer the first three doses of this protocol in the clinic, and then allow the patient to complete the remaining steps as an outpatient. The three-day protocol is sufficiently short and it can be administered entirely in the clinic, under medical supervision. This may be preferred, for example, if the patient's ability to follow a timed schedule of doses is uncertain. In contrast, the longer nine-day protocol may be better for reliable patients in whom the main concern is introducing the medication very gradually, as the success rate of this protocol was high.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H43\"><span class=\"h3\">Symptoms during desensitization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any symptoms that develop during desensitization must be promptly evaluated in the clinic. If a patient develops mild morbilliform rash during desensitization, without fever, systemic symptoms, or mucosal involvement, then we typically reduce the dose to the last tolerated step, and administer this dose repeatedly at the usual time intervals, while simultaneously treating the rash. We treat mild rashes with antihistamines and more extensive rashes with oral glucocorticoids. When the rash begins to improve, the doses can be escalated again, although we sometimes increase the doses more gradually.</p><p>We typically abort the desensitization protocol if fever or systemic symptoms develop.</p><p>More rapid protocols have also been published for TMP-SMX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfonamide-allergy-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].
