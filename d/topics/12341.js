While the reported prevalence of congenital heart disease is approximately one percent, a majority of children have innocent murmurs at some time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-common-causes-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-infants-and-children/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. One-third to three-quarters of children have an innocent murmur noted at some time between age 1 and 14 years, the most frequent of which is an innocent Still's murmur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-common-causes-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-infants-and-children/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. In a cross-sectional study of &gt;80,000 schoolchildren (age 5 to 13 years) in China, heart murmurs were detected in 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-common-causes-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-infants-and-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Murmurs detected after six hours of age may also be due to valve pathology or may represent shunt lesions that appear as pulmonary vascular resistance falls (atrial and ventricular septal defects, patent ductus arteriosus, peripheral pulmonary stenosis). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H347762066\"><span class=\"h3\">Patent ductus arteriosus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ductus arteriosus closes in approximately 90 percent of full-term neonates by 48 hours of age. Prolonged patency of the ductus arteriosus occurs in premature infants and those born at altitude [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-common-causes-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-infants-and-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The murmur of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65828\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65828 \">figure 1</a>) is best heard at the left upper sternal border, is typically continuous throughout both phases of the cardiac cycle, crescendo-decrescendo in shape, and has a rough machinery-type quality (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F104792\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef104792 \">movie 1</a>). Frequently, there are multiple clicks audible throughout the murmur, which likely arise from wave-like expansion of the pulmonary artery. In infants with a large left-to-right shunt, there can be a diastolic rumble at the apex representing &quot;relative mitral stenosis&quot; caused by an increased volume traversing the mitral valve. In premature infants, there often is only a systolic murmur. In children with persistent large PDAs and elevated pulmonary artery pressure, the second heart sound (S2) is loud and single and there may be no audible murmur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F104785\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef104785 \">movie 2</a>).

Tricuspid regurgitation also occurs in pulmonary atresia and Ebstein's anomaly. The murmur is best heard at the left lower sternal border, is typically holosystolic, and has a blowing quality. In neonates with birth asphyxia, the murmur typically becomes softer in the first few days of life associated with normal pulmonary vasodilation in the neonatal transition period, reduction in right ventricular systolic pressure, and return of normal papillary muscle function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-effects-of-perinatal-asphyxia#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic effects of perinatal asphyxia&quot;, section on 'Myocardial dysfunction'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebstein-anomaly\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Ebstein anomaly&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H347762180\"><span class=\"h3\">Ventricular septal defects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ventricular septal defect (VSD) murmurs are usually best heard at the left lower sternal border. Patients with subpulmonic (outlet) VSDs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55308\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55308 \">figure 2</a>) can have maximum intensity of the murmur higher on the left sternal border.</p><p>The size and type of the VSD determine the characteristics of the murmur:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small muscular VSDs &ndash; A small defect in the muscular portion of the interventricular septum produces a characteristic high frequency short systolic murmur that does not extend to S2 because the defect closes as the ventricle contracts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F104799\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef104799 \">movie 3</a>). Many of these defects spontaneously fully close in the first year of life.

If the ratio of pulmonary to systemic flow is &gt;2, there is an apical diastolic murmur that represents &quot;relative mitral stenosis&quot; caused by the increased pulmonary venous return that crosses the mitral valve. A large left-to-right shunt can also be accompanied by an apical third heart sound (S3). The quality of S2 helps distinguish a loud systolic murmur associated with a small or large ventricular septal defect (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F105391\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef105391 \">algorithm 1</a>). (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-isolated-ventricular-septal-defects-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and clinical features of isolated ventricular septal defects in infants and children&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p>VSDs are the most common causes of murmurs detected in the well-newborn nursery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-common-causes-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-infants-and-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The murmur associated with a VSD occurs as pulmonary vascular resistance decreases in the neonatal transition period, and therefore is not typically present in the first few hours of life. In small defects, the intensity of the murmur becomes louder as pulmonary vascular resistance decreases during the neonatal period and early infancy resulting in a larger pressure gradient between the ventricles. In large defects, the murmur intensity may increase due to increased left-to-right shunting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-isolated-ventricular-septal-defects-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and clinical features of isolated ventricular septal defects in infants and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H347762344\"><span class=\"h3\">Peripheral pulmonary stenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The murmur of peripheral pulmonary stenosis (PPS) is a common functional murmur that occurs in early infancy as pulmonary vascular resistance decreases. The PPS murmur is typically a grade 1 to 2, medium to high-pitched midsystolic ejection murmur heard best at the upper left or right sternal border with radiation to the axillae and back. It is caused by turbulent flow in the proximal pulmonary arteries associated with their relative size or angle of take-off from the main pulmonary artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-common-causes-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-infants-and-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This murmur usually resolves by age 6 to 12 months. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H347762364\"><span class=\"h3\">Pulmonary stenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obstruction at the level of the pulmonary valve creates a systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F104791\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef104791 \">movie 5</a>). The murmur is a midsystolic ejection murmur that is harsh in quality. If cardiac output is normal, the murmur becomes louder the greater the degree of obstruction; however, if there is right ventricular dysfunction, the murmur can be soft despite the presence of moderate or severe obstruction. Greater degrees of valve obstruction are also associated with less intense pulmonary component of S2. The murmur is accompanied by a variable early systolic ejection click that is more prominent in expiration. The ejection click is not present with more severe obstruction because of limited valve excursion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valvar-subvalvar-and-supravalvar-pulmonic-stenosis-ps-and-peripheral-pulmonic-stenosis-pps-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Valvar, subvalvar, and supravalvar pulmonic stenosis (PS) and peripheral pulmonic stenosis (PPS) in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H347762585\"><span class=\"h3\">Aortic stenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aortic valve obstruction produces a harsh midsystolic ejection murmur loudest at the right upper sternal border that radiates to the carotid arteries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F104800\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef104800 \">movie 6</a>). The murmur is accompanied by an early constant systolic click that is best heard at the apex (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F104790\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef104790 \">movie 7</a>). The click becomes softer or is absent as stenosis increases due to decreased mobility of the valve. A systolic thrill can be palpable in the suprasternal notch even in patients with only mild-to-moderate obstruction. The presence of such a thrill helps to distinguish this murmur from pulmonary stenosis. A precordial thrill at the right upper sternal border is required for assignment of a grade 4 murmur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F105030\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105030 \">table 2</a>). The loudness of the murmur depends on the degree of obstruction and level of myocardial function. Moderate to severe obstruction produces a loud murmur when cardiac output is normal and a soft murmur when cardiac output is reduced. The murmur peaks later in systole the more severe the obstruction. Aortic stenosis in pediatric patients is most commonly associated with a bicuspid aortic valve, but as an isolated lesion it is rarely diagnosed in infancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Valvar aortic stenosis in children&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H347762613\"><span class=\"h3\">Coarctation of the aorta</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The murmur of coarctation of the aorta (COA) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F103747\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103747 \">figure 3</a>) is best heard on the back between the scapulae, which is near the region of the aortic isthmus where coarctation typically occurs. This murmur can occasionally be heard in the left infraclavicular region, which is close to the distal portion of the transverse arch. Patients with long-standing significant COA develop collateral arteries to bypass the obstruction, and these create a continuous murmur in the lateral portion of the chest. Additional findings that are suggestive of COA include weak femoral pulses, systemic hypertension, or a systolic pressure gradient &gt;10 mmHg between the right arm and leg.

It may be difficult to distinguish the ejection click from a split first hear sound (S1), and echocardiography is needed for clarification.</p><p>Bicuspid aortic valves can be associated with aortic stenosis with its characteristic murmur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F104800\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef104800 \">movie 6</a>).</p><p>Bicuspid aortic valves can also be associated with aortic regurgitation. This diastolic murmur is best heard at the left upper sternal border, is decrescendo in shape, and is blowing in quality (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F104802\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef104802 \">movie 14</a>). The murmur is usually easier to hear with the patient sitting rather than supine. The extent of radiation of the murmur usually correlates with severity with mild limited to the left upper sternal border, moderate audible also at the left mid-sternal border, and severe regurgitation audible to the left lower sternal border.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H347763228\"><span class=\"h3\">Pericarditis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A pericardial friction rub (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F104793\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef104793 \">movie 15</a>) occurs when inflamed visceral and parietal pericardial surfaces rub against each other; the rub is often absent in the presence of large pericardial effusions. The sound is similar to rubbing two pieces of sandpaper together and has a scratching quality. The friction rub is generally present in both systole and diastole. The friction rub is best heard at the left sternal border in inspiration with the patient sitting and leaning forward. Viral infection and postpericardiotomy syndrome are the most common etiologies of pericarditis in children, though there are many other etiologies.

The association of murmurs with heart disease is higher in infants and decreases with age during childhood and adolescence. Being able to distinguish a murmur associated with heart disease from a benign etiology is important for diagnosis and management (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F105035\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105035 \">table 1</a>).
