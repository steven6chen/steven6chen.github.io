This mechanism contributes to digoxin&rsquo;s hemodynamic, neurohumoral, and electrophysiologic effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-digoxin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3653154814\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemodynamic effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In myocytes, increased intracellular sodium (resulting from Na-K-ATPase inhibition by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>) reduces sodium-calcium exchange (which normally causes calcium extrusion from the cell), leading to a rise in the intracellular calcium concentration. This results in improved isolated myocyte contractile performance (increased shortening velocity) and improved overall left ventricular (LV) systolic function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-digoxin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>].</p><p>Several small trials have examined the short-term hemodynamic efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> in patients with systolic HF using invasive monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-digoxin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. These studies showed that the administration of 1 mg of intravenous digoxin resulted in an acute improvement in cardiac output, LV stroke work index, mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), pulmonary artery diastolic pressure, and right atrial pressure, either at rest or with exercise. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Digoxin</a> has variable effects on systemic vascular resistance: digoxin may reduce systemic vascular resistance in patients with severe congestive HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-digoxin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>], but digoxin may have no effect on systemic vascular resistance or even increase it in patients with less hemodynamic impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-digoxin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3396911819\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurohumoral effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with HF, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> also inhibits sympathetic outflow and augments parasympathetic tone. Digoxin may decrease sympathetic tone by multiple mechanisms, including direct autonomic effects, as well as by normalizing impaired baroreflex responsiveness (improving carotid sinus baroreceptor sensitivity), and increasing cardiac output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-digoxin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. At excess levels, digoxin may augment sympathetic tone. </p><p>HF is characterized by activation of neurohumoral systems, resulting in progressive increases in the plasma concentrations of norepinephrine, renin, antidiuretic hormone, atrial natriuretic peptide, and endothelin. The degree of neurohumoral activation generally varies directly with the severity of the congestive HF and inversely with patient survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-digoxin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].

In this study, 161 patients were randomly assigned to ibopamine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>, or placebo.

As noted above, digoxin inhibits the ATPase-dependent sodium-potassium pump, thus increasing intracellular sodium; this in turn reduces the activity of sodium-calcium exchange, resulting in an increase in intracellular calcium. Elevated intracellular calcium and vagal tone facilitate the development of arrhythmias.

The trial enrolled nearly 6800 patients with symptomatic HF, an LVEF &le;45 percent, and normal sinus rhythm who were randomly assigned to digoxin or placebo.

For example, inhibitors of P-glycoprotein efflux transporters (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dronedarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dronedarone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propafenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propafenone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinidine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a>) can increase serum digoxin levels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73326\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73326 \">table 1</a>). Inducers of P-glycoprotein (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a>, etc), on the other hand, can decrease serum digoxin levels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73326\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73326 \">table 1</a>). Diuretics may increase digoxin toxicity as a result of decrease in the glomerular filtration rate and the development of electrolyte abnormalities, especially hypokalemia. Specific interactions of digoxin with other medications may be determined using the drug interactions program (Lexi-Interact) included within UpToDate. This tool can be accessed from the Drug Interactions link in the top right corner of your browser window in UpToDate online or through the individual drug monographs in the section &quot;Drug Interactions.&quot; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-with-digoxin-initial-dosing-monitoring-and-dose-modification#H4682539\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment with digoxin: Initial dosing, monitoring, and dose modification&quot;, section on 'Dose adjustment with concomitant medications'</a>.)</p><p>For patients with cardiac amyloidosis, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> should generally be avoided. The inotropic effects of digoxin are not generally beneficial in patients with cardiac amyloidosis. Moreover, because digoxin binds avidly to amyloid fibrils, patients with amyloidosis who take digoxin may be at an increased risk of digoxin toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-digoxin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Additionally, as a result of the binding of digoxin to myocardial amyloid fibrils, cardiac digoxin concentration may be higher than SDC, leading to toxicity in the setting of &quot;therapeutic&quot; serum digoxin levels. However, digoxin (in combination with a beta blocker or as an alternative to a beta blocker when beta blocker use is contraindicated) may be helpful for rate control for patients with cardiac amyloidosis in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-digoxin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H939345133\"><span class=\"h2\">Baseline and follow-up testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to initiation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> and periodically during use, serum electrolytes (particularly potassium and magnesium levels) and renal function (including blood urea nitrogen [BUN] and serum creatinine levels) should be assessed. Digoxin dose adjustment is based upon renal function, as discussed below. Since hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or hypercalcemia may increase the risk of digoxin-induced arrhythmias, these abnormalities should be corrected prior to and during treatment with digoxin. Hypothyroidism is a risk factor for digoxin toxicity, so thyroid function tests should be checked before initiating digoxin in patients being treated for hypo- or hyperthyroidism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2792240474\"><span class=\"h2\">Digoxin dosing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> dose is adjusted based upon renal function, ideal body weight, and the presence of concomitant medications that alter digoxin levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-digoxin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>].
