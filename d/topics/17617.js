The two studies, although begun independently, were analyzed together as a prospective, individual-patient data meta-analysis with a primary end point of in-hospital mortality rate. The in-hospital mortality rate was not significantly different between the treatment groups (25.1 compared with 26.6 percent with combination therapy, respectively).</p><p>The possibility that addition of TMP-SMX to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftazidime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftazidime</a> in the intensive therapy phase might have long-term benefit was evaluated in a later report of the 190 patients with culture-confirmed melioidosis in these trials who survived to hospital discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-melioidosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. At a median of 71 weeks, there was no difference between the two groups with regard to the combined end point of mortality or culture-confirmed recurrent melioidosis (17.8 versus 18.3 percent) with ceftazidime alone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Alternative agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A trial in Thailand suggested that cefoperazone-sulbactam plus TMP-SMX might be a useful alternative to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftazidime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftazidime</a> plus TMP-SMX for initial intensive therapy, although the number of patients in the study was inadequate for a conclusive result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-melioidosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In addition, others have shown that treatment failure is more common with high-dose intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-and-clavulanate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin-clavulanate</a> than with ceftazidime [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-melioidosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], and the former is generally not recommended for intensive therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Duration of intensive therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The duration of initial intensive therapy should be at least 10 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-melioidosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], with the Northern Territory guidelines stating at least 14 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-melioidosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Four to eight weeks or longer of intensive therapy should be administered to patients who are critically ill, have extensive pulmonary disease, deep seated collections or organ abscesses, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, or neurologic melioidosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F109904\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109904 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-melioidosis/abstract/9,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,35</a>]. This recommendation to adjust duration of initial intensive intravenous therapy based on the clinical presentation is supported by a retrospective study of over 200 patients with melioidosis who were treated accordingly, with a median intensive therapy duration of 26 days, and had a very low relapse rate (0.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-melioidosis/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Adjunctive therapy in the intensive phase</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Abscess drainage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prostatic abscesses usually require drainage since treatment failures have developed when this was not performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-melioidosis/abstract/9,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,38,39</a>]. Drainage can be done under CT or portable transrectal ultrasound guidance, which can be performed in ventilated patients. Mycotic aneurysms are increasingly recognized as occurring in melioidosis and require urgent surgery, often with insertion of prosthetic vascular grafts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-melioidosis/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. By contrast, other internal collections frequently resolve with medical therapy and rarely need to be drained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-melioidosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Recombinant G-CSF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Melioidosis has been associated with functional neutrophil defects. For this reason, recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was adopted for use in patients with septic shock due to melioidosis in the Northern Territory of Australia in December 1998 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-melioidosis/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. A retrospective study using historical controls examined the mortality rates before and after the introduction of G-CSF therapy during the period of 1989-2002 in 42 patients with septic shock and culture-confirmed melioidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-melioidosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Mortality in patients treated with G-CSF was dramatically lower (10 compared with 95 percent in historical controls without G-CSF therapy).</p><p>These benefits were not confirmed in a subsequent randomized trial in Thailand in which 60 ceftazidime-treated patients with severe sepsis caused by suspected melioidosis were treated with G-CSF or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-melioidosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Melioidosis was confirmed by culture in 18 patients given G-CSF and 23 given placebo. G-CSF therapy was associated with a nonsignificant reduction in mortality overall (70 versus 87 percent, hazard ratio 0.81, 95% CI 0.61-1.06) and in the patients with culture-proven melioidosis (83 versus 96 percent, hazard ratio 0.87, 95% CI 0.7-1.1). The duration of survival was significantly longer with G-CSF (34 versus 15 hours).</p><p>In the observational study from Australia suggesting benefit from G-CSF, potential confounders that could have contributed to the lower mortality rate included earlier use of effective antibiotics and adoption of a closed intensive care model in the later G-CSF period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-melioidosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

This phase of treatment begins immediately after completion of initial intensive therapy. We prefer TMP-SMX alone for eradication therapy, although the optimal duration of eradication therapy remains uncertain. Studies from multiple locations have confirmed that resistance of <em>B. pseudomallei</em> to TMP-SMX is extremely uncommon and that prior reported higher levels of resistance from Thailand and elsewhere were due to methodological issues with susceptibility testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-melioidosis/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Choice of agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend oral eradication therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (TMP-SMX). The dosing varies by weight and age (for children, TMP-SMX 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim</a> component up to 240 mg PO twice daily; for adults weighing 40 to 60kg, TMP-SMX 240 mg of the trimethoprim component PO twice daily; for adults weighing &gt;60 kg, 320 mg of the trimethoprim component [two double-strength tablets] PO twice daily). As with initial intensive therapy, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> (0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> up to 5 mg PO daily) should be added to the TMP-SMX regimen. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Doxycycline</a> has been used with TMP-SMX for eradication therapy in some parts of the world, but TMP-SMX appears to be the critical component of this combination regimen. This was supported by the results of a randomized, multi-center, double-blind trial in Thailand in which 626 patients with culture-confirmed melioidosis received TMP-SMX plus placebo or doxycycline for at least 20 weeks as eradication therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-melioidosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. After a median follow-up of 17 to 19 months, there was no difference in the rates of culture-confirmed recurrent melioidosis between the two groups (5 versus 7 percent with TMP-SMX plus placebo and TMP-SMX plus doxycycline, respectively). There was a higher rate of adverse drug reactions TMP-SMX plus doxycycline. Similarly, the standard use of TMP-SMX alone for melioidosis eradication therapy in the Northern Territory, Australia was associated with good outcomes, with relapses being almost exclusively limited to noncompliant patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-melioidosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>An earlier trial of eradication therapy in Thailand evaluated combination therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloramphenicol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloramphenicol</a> (first four weeks only), TMP-SMX, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> versus doxycycline alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-melioidosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Relapses were significantly higher with doxycycline alone. Similar failures of doxycycline alone as eradication therapy have been noted in the Northern Territory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-melioidosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>], with some <em>B. pseudomallei</em> relapse isolates showing acquired doxycycline resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-melioidosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Nevertheless, doxycycline is the preferred alternative agent for eradication therapy in those in whom TMP-SMX is contraindicated or where TMP-SMX is ceased because of adverse events such as renal impairment, bone marrow suppression, rash or intractable nausea. The dose of doxycycline is 100mg twice daily or 200mg once daily. A subsequent randomized trial in Thailand found no benefit from adding chloramphenicol to a TMP-SMX plus doxycycline regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-melioidosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>Both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-and-clavulanate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin-clavulanate</a> alone and oral quinolones (alone or in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a>) are less effective in preventing relapse than eradication therapy with TMP-SMX and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloramphenicol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloramphenicol</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-melioidosis/abstract/7,50-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,50-53</a>].

As a result, quinolones are NOT recommended for eradication of <em>B. pseudomallei</em>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Duration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest eradication therapy continue for a minimum of three months, except in patients with osteomyelitis or neurologic melioidosis, in whom eradication therapy for six months is recommended (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F109904\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109904 \">table 1</a>). Longer durations and potentially lifelong therapy may be necessary following vascular surgery with grafts for mycotic aneurysms. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK OF RELAPSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Earlier studies using molecular typing of isolates from recurrent melioidosis showed that the majority were true relapses from failed eradication, rather than new infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-melioidosis/abstract/48,56-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,56-60</a>]. This was illustrated in a retrospective study of 889 Thai patients with culture-confirmed melioidosis who survived and underwent follow-up: 86 patients (9.7 percent) relapsed and 30 (3.4 percent) became reinfected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-melioidosis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>However, a subsequent analysis of the Darwin prospective melioidosis study from Australia documented that since the late 1990s, recurrent melioidosis has become very uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-melioidosis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. In this analysis, molecular typing of isolates from recurrent melioidosis cases suggested a shift from predominantly relapsed infection to predominantly reinfection. The decreased rate of relapse cases was attributed to improved antibiotic therapy and in particular, prolongation of the intensive intravenous phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-melioidosis/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].</p><p>There are a number of reasons for failure of eradication therapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relapses are more common in patients with severe disease compared with those with localized melioidosis (relative risk 4.7 for severe infection in one series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-melioidosis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>], emphasizing the importance of a sufficiently long duration of preceding intravenous intensive therapy. Multifocal distribution of disease and positive blood cultures have also been associated with relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-melioidosis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another important factor is poor compliance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-melioidosis/abstract/24,48,50,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,48,50,57</a>]. In the Northern Territory, we attempt to maximize compliance cases by regular follow-up during the eradication phase, with free antibiotics and action plans for defaulters, analogous to TB programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-melioidosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The duration of eradication therapy is also important. Relapses after &le;8 weeks of total therapy were more likely than after more than 12 weeks of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-melioidosis/abstract/57,60,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,60,62</a>]. In a study from Thailand, for example, the risk of relapse was 90 percent lower in patients treated for 12 to 16 weeks compared to those treated for &le;8 weeks (HR 0.10, 95% CI 0.02-0.44) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-melioidosis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Thus, eradication therapy is recommended for 12 to 20 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-melioidosis/abstract/7,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,50</a>] or at least three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-melioidosis/abstract/9,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,35</a>].</p><p/><p>Treatment of relapses usually requires reinitiation of intravenous intensive therapy, followed by eradication therapy. Surgical drainage of any persisting collections may be required and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of relapse isolates is critical to exclude acquired resistance to standard therapies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The proportion of asymptomatic seropositive individuals who have latent infection resulting in activation and disease later in life is unknown. As long as adequate duration of intravenous therapy is given and the eradication phase of therapy is completed, the prognosis is excellent in patients with non-bacteremic melioidosis. In the Northern Territory series, the mortality rate was only 4 percent in such patients compared with 37 percent in bacteremic cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-melioidosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. There were also no fatalities in those with chronic melioidosis (symptoms of &gt;2 months duration before diagnosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-melioidosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Although fulminant melioidosis can occur in healthy individuals, severe disease and fatalities are uncommon in those without defined risk factors, provided there is access to appropriate antibiotics and intensive supportive care for severe sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-melioidosis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. In the Northern Territory prospective melioidosis study, only 2 of the 77 fatalities amongst 540 melioidosis patients did not have an identifiable risk factor for melioidosis, and both these patients were elderly (75 and 82 years old) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-melioidosis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. In that study both presence of one or more defined risk factors for melioidosis (OR 9.4) and age &ge;50 years (OR 2.0) were independent risk factors for death.</p><p>In a randomized controlled treatment trial in Thailand, the following were identified as being independent risk factors for death and treatment failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-melioidosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bacteremia (odds ratio [OR] 2.9)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory failure (OR, 6.7)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal failure (OR 3.1)</p><p/><p>The prognosis of neurologic melioidosis is more guarded. In a series of 12 cases from the Northern Territory, five required prolonged intubation, three died, and only three made a complete recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-melioidosis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p>Nevertheless, with early diagnosis and institution of therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftazidime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftazidime</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meropenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meropenem</a> and access to state-of-the-art intensive care therapy, the overall mortality from melioidosis can now be as low as 10 percent. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that all cases of melioidosis, even mild disease, be treated with initial intensive antimicrobial therapy followed by eradication therapy.
