It is characterized by recurrent episodes of angioedema without pruritus or urticaria, which most often affect the skin or mucosal tissues of the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Although swelling resolves spontaneously in two to five days in the absence of treatment, angioedema is often temporarily debilitating, and laryngeal angioedema may cause fatal asphyxiation.</p><p>In patients with sufficiently frequent or severe episodes of angioedema, regularly administered prophylaxis is required to maintain an acceptable quality of life. This is referred to as long-term prophylaxis, in contrast to short-term prophylaxis, which is premedication given briefly before a specific medical or dental procedure. Short-term prophylaxis is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-angioedema-temporary-prophylaxis-before-procedures-or-stress-to-prevent-angioedema-episodes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary angioedema: Temporary prophylaxis before procedures or stress to prevent angioedema episodes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The general management of adults and children with HAE and the various long-term prophylactic therapies that are used to prevent attacks will be reviewed here. The management of acute attacks as well as the clinical manifestations, pathogenesis, and diagnosis of this condition are discussed elsewhere:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-angioedema-treatment-of-acute-attacks\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary angioedema: Treatment of acute attacks&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-angioedema-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-exacerbating-factors-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary angioedema: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, exacerbating factors, and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary angioedema: Pathogenesis and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>There is another form of HAE in which patients have normal complement studies called HAE with normal C1INH. This disorder affects mainly women, while men are often asymptomatic carriers. Mutations in at least three genes (coding for coagulation factor XII, plasminogen, and angiopoietin 1) have been associated with some patients with HAE with normal C1INH. This disorder is also characterized by the tendency of estrogens in exacerbating the swelling. HAE with normal C1INH is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary angioedema with normal C1 inhibitor&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>General care measures for HAE include education, testing of family members, identification and avoidance of possible triggers, and planning for acute attacks. An international committee formulated a consensus report for the management of patients with HAE in 2010, which was updated in 2012, and is based upon the available literature and practices worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-general-care-and-long-term-prophylaxis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Recommendations have also been published by an expert American group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-general-care-and-long-term-prophylaxis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The recommendations made in this review are consistent with these publications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Education</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important intervention for a patient who has been newly diagnosed with HAE is education about the disease. Both the affected individual and <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> family members should be involved. Patients can access detailed, patient-oriented information through the <a href=\"http://www.haea.org/&amp;token=y6FUHJH3MpZ/fPODTo9FR36Vj9x6gYNIcK9E+3MTX0k=&amp;TOPIC_ID=8100\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">United States Hereditary Angioedema Association</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.haei.org/&amp;token=y6FUHJH3MpZ/fPODTo9FR15Oyya6DWwbtJMlfYLreRU=&amp;TOPIC_ID=8100\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">International Patient Organization for C1 Inhibitor Deficiencies</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H608948951\"><span class=\"h2\">Testing of family members</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>First-degree relatives of the patient should be offered diagnostic testing for HAE. The disease is transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion with variable penetrance. However, the patient may be the first affected member in <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> family, since approximately 25 percent of cases result from new mutations.</p><p>Testing of all first-degree family members is encouraged, since a cohort study demonstrated that the risk of death from asphyxiation was greater in patients with undiagnosed HAE compared with those who had been formally diagnosed and educated about the condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-general-care-and-long-term-prophylaxis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It should be explained to patients that one-half of the children of a person with HAE can be expected to have the abnormal gene, although not everyone with the abnormal gene has symptoms. Some people with the abnormal gene have minimal or no symptoms, while others have symptoms of variable severity, and there is no way to predict how severely an individual will be affected. Another advantage of testing is that it may help avoid diagnostic confusion and inappropriate treatment if and when the person does develop symptoms.</p><p>Complement studies (C4, C1 inhibitor [C1INH] level, and C1INH function) are the recommended tests for screening family members. Additional issues surrounding testing are discussed elsewhere.

However, C1INH is far more costly than androgens or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranexamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tranexamic acid</a> (TA). C1INH prophylaxis can be administered by intravenous or subcutaneous injection. When administered intravenously, repeated injections can lead to problems with venous access, and the placement of indwelling ports is discouraged because of risk of infection and thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-general-care-and-long-term-prophylaxis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous plasma-derived C1 inhibitor'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3035677939\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous recombinant C1 inhibitor'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A subcutaneous preparation of pdC1INH was approved for long-term prophylaxis in the United States in 2017. This will be particularly helpful for patients with difficult venous access. It is anticipated to become available in other countries soon.

It is least problematic in postpubertal males, particularly when used at a low dose. It may be tolerated by women too, if the doses required to control symptoms are sufficiently low. It should not be used in growing children or pregnant or lactating women, unless there are extenuating circumstances. (See <a href=\"#H136389429\" class=\"local\">'Attenuated androgens'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Antifibrinolytics</strong> &mdash; Antifibrinolytic agents include TA and epsilon <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aminocaproic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aminocaproic acid</a> (EACA, also called aminocaproic acid). These are less predictably effective for preventing HAE episodes compared with pdC1INH concentrate or androgens, and some patients have problems tolerating them. However, antifibrinolytics can be useful for long-term prophylaxis in growing children and possibly in women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant in the near future, in whom androgens should not be used. Once a woman is pregnant or lactating, pdC1INH concentrate is preferred for prophylaxis. Consensus guidelines do not emphasize the use of antifibrinolytics, but they remain an option [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-general-care-and-long-term-prophylaxis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

It is appropriate for those individuals who have frequent symptoms that cannot be adequately controlled by on-demand treatment. Before long-term prophylaxis is considered, the clinician should assure the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-general-care-and-long-term-prophylaxis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trigger avoidance should be optimized in all patients. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Trigger avoidance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients should have access to on-demand therapy in countries where these medications are available. When on-demand treatment is readily available to patients, it is highly effective in reducing the time a patient remains symptomatic and can efficiently prevent the burden of the disease, which is directly related to symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H362573055\" class=\"local\">'Access to &quot;on-demand&quot; therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>Once these aspects of care are in place, the patients who do not experience sufficient benefit can be considered for long-term prophylaxis.</p><p>The decision about when it is appropriate to initiate long-term prophylaxis is approached somewhat differently around the world:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In some European countries (eg, Italy), regulatory authorities have stipulated that patients are eligible for long-term prophylaxis with twice weekly injections of pdC1INH if they are requiring four or more on-demand treatments per month. This policy was adapted from hemophilia, where prophylactic injections of factor VIII are initiated when the number of on-demand approaches the number of prophylactic injections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-general-care-and-long-term-prophylaxis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>United States guidelines suggest that the decision to initiate long-term prophylaxis be individualized, based upon multiple parameters, including attack frequency, comorbidities, patient preferences, access to emergency care, etc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-general-care-and-long-term-prophylaxis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p>As effective on-demand therapies have become widely available in many countries, the percentage of patients who require long-term prophylaxis has decreased substantially. Data are limited, but the authors estimate that from 20 (MC) to 30 percent (BZ) of their patient panels are on long-term prophylactic therapies. In contrast, in countries where access to on-demand therapy is limited, long-term prophylaxis is required by most symptomatic patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H362572486\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of agent in specific groups</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each of the agents above has advantages and disadvantages in specific patient groups:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H601895853\"><span class=\"h3\">Prepubescent children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prepubertal children can usually be managed with on-demand therapies alone, because HAE symptoms are generally less severe prior to puberty. The expanded availability of these therapies for acute attacks has greatly reduced the number of children who require long-term prophylaxis. However, data reflecting the impact of modern therapies of the management of children and adolescents are still limited.</p><p>Before the newer therapies became available, management options in children consisted of TA and androgens, while C1INH was usually reserved for life-threatening attacks. One group published outcomes of a cohort of 48 children (23 boys and 25 girls), followed from diagnosis until age 18, in which TA was the initial agent given for long-term prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-general-care-and-long-term-prophylaxis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Overall, a relatively low percentage of children (19 percent) required long-term prophylaxis initially, compared with adult populations. However, by the age of 18 years, 43 percent required prophylaxis, with most needing to start long-term prophylaxis around the time of puberty. Some patients were adequately controlled with intermittent use of long-term prophylaxis during times when more attacks were anticipated (eg, during school exams, flu season, winter months, family crises, or puberty). If symptoms were not controlled by TA, it was stopped and replaced with low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=danazol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">danazol</a> (starting at 100 mg every other day). Only 2 of 48 patients required significant use of pdC1INH concentrate. Using this approach, serious side effects of danazol were avoided in children of both sexes.</p><p>We suggest avoiding androgens in children who require long-term prophylaxis despite on-demand therapy. TA or regularly scheduled pdC1INH injections are better options. TA is easier to administer, while pdC1INH is expected to be far more effective. Available data do not indicate major risks with either drug. Therefore, one approach would be a course with TA (25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily up to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span> initially. If this does not control symptoms sufficiently after a few weeks, then it should be discontinued and regular injections of pdC1INH given instead. These suggestions are based on clinical experience and may change as more information about the newer therapies becomes available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H362573076\"><span class=\"h3\">Adult men</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If on-demand therapy does not sufficiently reduce disease burden, long-term prophylaxis should be considered. The approach of the American author (BZ) is to present all three treatment options, review the advantages and disadvantages of each, and make a joint decision about which therapy should be tried initially (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F83115\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83115 \">table 1</a>). The two options that are most successful in adult men are androgens or regular injections of pdC1INH.</p><p>The approach of the Italian author (MC) is to offer men either androgens or TA initially, unless there is a specific contraindication or patient objection. If TA is chosen, a trial of full-dose therapy is undertaken for a few weeks. If TA does not result in sufficient improvement, it should be stopped and androgen therapy initiated. Once attacks have subsided on androgens, most patients do not require high doses to keep the disease under control. For men who develop side effects from androgens, require relative high doses of prevent attacks, or have certain comorbidities (eg, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, mood disorders), regular injections of pdC1INH may be used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H601895823\"><span class=\"h3\">Women not considering pregnancy in the near future</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach of the American author (BZ) is to present all three treatment options, review the advantages and disadvantages of each, and make a joint decision about which therapy should be tried initially.</p><p>The approach of the Italian author (MC) is to start with TA in most cases.

However, the use of indwelling injection ports, which can be complicated by clotting and infection, should be avoided in patients with HAE.</p><p>pdC1INH concentrate treatment confers a theoretical risk of disease transmission. Before the introduction of virucidal methods (from 1980 to 1985), a high percentage of HAE patients were infected with hepatitis C virus through a lyophilized preparation manufactured by Immuno Vienna (later Baxter). In response to this, pdC1INH was subsequently vapor-heated to inactivate viruses, and the source of plasma was changed to carefully screened donors and continually monitored for pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-general-care-and-long-term-prophylaxis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Since vapor-heated pdC1INH became standard, only hepatitis G transmission has been reported, and the pathogenic significance of hepatitis G infection is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-general-care-and-long-term-prophylaxis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Production of the Baxter pdC1INH product was subsequently discontinued in 2004.

Cinryze and Berinert are also nanofiltered. Postmarketing surveillance for Berinert P since 1985 has revealed no case of viral transmission, despite the administration of hundreds of millions of units. Processing methods also remove prions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-general-care-and-long-term-prophylaxis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Usefulness for monitoring C4 or C1INH antigenic levels has not been tested. For patients receiving C1INH concentrate, studies have not been undertaken to correlate successful therapy with specific C1INH levels, and attacks may subside at levels of C1INH that are still significantly below normal.</p><p>Periodic testing for hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is recommended for patients regularly receiving pdC1INH.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3035677939\"><span class=\"h2\">Intravenous recombinant C1 inhibitor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A <a href=\"topic.htm?path=c1-esterase-inhibitor-recombinant-human-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">recombinant human C1 inhibitor</a> (rhC1INH) preparation, conestat alfa (Ruconest in the United States and Europe, Rhucin in other countries), is also available and is approved for on-demand treatment. Because it has a shorter half-life than pdC1INH (3 hours versus 18 to 56 hours), its use in prophylaxis required investigation. A phase 2 multicenter randomized trial of 26 patients demonstrated that rhC1INH was effective for prophylaxis when injected intravenously either once or twice per week at a dose of 50 international units per kilogram per dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-general-care-and-long-term-prophylaxis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. To be included in the trial, patients had to have a high rate of attacks (ie, four or more attacks per month in the preceding three months) and no evidence of allergy to rabbits (as the drug is secreted in the milk of transgenic rabbits). Twice weekly and once weekly injections resulted in a mean of 2.7 and 4.4 attacks per month, respectively, compared with 7.2 attacks per month with placebo. Headache and nasopharyngitis were the most common adverse events, and anaphylaxis did not occur. Advantages of prophylaxis with rhC1INH compared with pdC1INH are the stability of the supply chain (as rhC1INH does not rely on human blood donors) and the lack of risk of transmission of blood-borne infections.

The primary endpoint was number of episodes of angioedema, which was reduced 89 and 95 percent with the lower and higher dose, respectively, relative to placebo. For patients taking the higher dose, there were 3.51 fewer attacks per month compared with placebo (95% CI, -4.21 to -2.81). The predominant adverse effect was mild injection site reactions that did not lead to discontinuation. Earlier studies of twice weekly injections of pdC1INH demonstrated that subcutaneous injection resulted in higher and more sustained plasma levels relative to twice weekly intravenous administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-general-care-and-long-term-prophylaxis/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Higher levels of plasma C1INH function correlated with a lower risk of attacks. The study showed variability among subjects in post-injection functional C1INH plasma levels, such that individualized dose adjustment may be needed for optimal disease control.

Using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=danazol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">danazol</a> as an example, therapy is begun with 400 to 600 mg daily until new attacks have ceased (sometimes this is apparent in less than one month). The dose can then be tapered over several weeks to 200 mg daily, although the guidelines suggest tapering more slowly (eg, by 100 mg daily per month or by one-third of the dose per month if there are no breakthroughs). When 200 mg daily is attained, therapy is tapered by 50 mg every two months and by every three months when below 100 mg per day. The minimum dose is 50 mg daily for five days every week for most patients. For those in whom a breakthrough attack occurs, remission can be reinduced by resuming the last effective dose and then using a higher maintenance dose.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The equivalent dosing for stanozolol is 2 to 4 mg daily for the first month and then gradual tapering to the minimal effective dose, which is generally in the range of 0.5 to 2 mg daily.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Initial low dose</strong> &ndash; This regimen involves the initiation of therapy with low doses, with increases in the dose as necessary.

Using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=danazol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">danazol</a> as an example, therapy is initiated at a dose of 100 mg daily for men and 50 mg daily for women. If there is no response after two weeks, the dose is increased to 200 mg daily <span class=\"nowrap\">(men)/100</span> mg daily (women) for two to four weeks. An alternative approach is to start with 200 mg, the highest suggested dose of danazol. If the patient has fewer attacks, the dose can be gradually reduced to the minimal effective dose. If there is no clinical improvement, therapy should be stopped. If initial doses readily control symptoms, the dose can be decreased slowly to determine the lowest effective dose for that patient.</p><p/><p>General observations regarding the use of attenuated androgens for long-term prophylaxis include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In postpubertal females, androgenic effects may be troublesome, and regulation of periods and use of other hormones can become issues.

As an example, a patient taking 200 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=danazol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">danazol</a> daily for prophylaxis could increase the dose to 400 mg three times daily and maintain the higher dose until there is some indication of clinical improvement or an attack ensues. Although there are anecdotal reports of efficacy, this intervention has not been studied, and opponents of the practice counter that androgens should not be able to stimulate production quickly enough to be effective when used in this manner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-general-care-and-long-term-prophylaxis/abstract/1,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,43</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2886582871\"><span class=\"h3\">Adverse effects and contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At the doses typically required (ie, 200 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=danazol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">danazol</a> daily or less), androgen therapy is usually tolerated by postpubertal males and by some female patients, as well.

Of note, Cinryze has been associated with a small number of cases of thrombosis, as well. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects'</a> above.)</p><p>Experience with TA is greatest in Europe and Asia, where it has been available for decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-general-care-and-long-term-prophylaxis/abstract/11,54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,54,55</a>]. In the United States, EACA has been available for many years, and an oral preparation of TA became available in 2009 when it was approved by the FDA for the treatment of menorrhagia. Antifibrinolytics are not FDA-approved for HAE, although this does not preclude their use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H230015482\"><span class=\"h3\">Dosing and efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In both children and adults, TA is administered for long-term prophylaxis at a dose of 1 to 3 grams per day or at a total daily amount of 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> divided into two to three doses per day. An initial dose of 3 grams per day is suggested for adults, as only about one-third will respond well enough to lower the dose. However, the dose of TA must be reduced for patients with renal impairment.</p><p>In observational studies of TA, attack frequency and severity are reduced somewhat in about 70 percent of patients, although efficacy seems higher in some case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-general-care-and-long-term-prophylaxis/abstract/53,56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,56,57</a>]. Overall, there is a general agreement that a sufficient response is seen in less than 30 percent. Still, TA has been used successfully for long-term prophylaxis in pediatric patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-general-care-and-long-term-prophylaxis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H601895853\" class=\"local\">'Prepubescent children'</a> above.)</p><p>The usual prophylactic dose of EACA in adults is 1 to 2 grams per dose, given three times per day (ie, 3 to 6 grams daily). For children, the suggested dose is 0.05 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per dose, given two times per day.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H230015559\"><span class=\"h3\">Adverse effects and contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antifibrinolytics carry the potential risk of intravascular thrombosis, although the true prothrombotic effects of these medications have not been quantified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-general-care-and-long-term-prophylaxis/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. These agents should not be used in patients with increased thrombotic risk or history of ischemic events.</p><p>Additional side effects associated with these agents include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TA uncommonly causes gastrointestinal distress, headache, and anal pruritus, which can occur early in therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-general-care-and-long-term-prophylaxis/abstract/11,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,53</a>]. There are also reports of retinal damage with prolonged use of higher doses of TA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-general-care-and-long-term-prophylaxis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EACA is associated with several adverse effects at higher doses than are indicated for HAE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-general-care-and-long-term-prophylaxis/abstract/56,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,62</a>]. However, at the doses typically used in HAE patients, gastrointestinal distress is typically the main adverse effect, and some patients tolerate it quite well.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H230015691\"><span class=\"h3\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The therapeutic success of TA is determined clinically, and each patient should be maintained on the lowest dose that adequately prevents attacks.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Laboratory values</strong> &ndash; Doses are adjusted for decreased renal function, so blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine should be measured yearly. The 2010 consensus algorithm suggests that creatinine kinase, tests of liver and renal function, and urinalysis be performed every six months, although some experts feel yearly evaluation is sufficient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ophthalmologic exam</strong> &ndash; Annual assessment of ocular pressure has been suggested for patients on long-term therapy, based on the theoretical concern that retinal thrombosis could block outflow of aqueous humor. Periodic ophthalmologic exams for patients on long-term therapy are suggested by some drug information databases because of early reports of ophthalmologic tumors in animals treated with high doses of TA, although this has never been reported in humans. The authors have not performed ophthalmologic exams as part of monitoring therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1923142081\"><span class=\"h1\">INVESTIGATIONAL THERAPIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Agents in clinical trials include an oral plasma kallikrein inhibitor and a monoclonal antibody to plasma kallikrein.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An oral plasma kallikrein inhibitor, avoralstat, has been developed for prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-general-care-and-long-term-prophylaxis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. In a randomized trial of 24 patients with relatively severe HAE due to deficient or dysfunctional C1 inhibitor (C1INH) (ie, with an average of one or more attacks per week at baseline), subjects received four weeks of avoralstat (three times daily) or placebo, followed by four weeks of the other treatment, in a crossover design [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-general-care-and-long-term-prophylaxis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Subjects experienced 79 attacks while taking avoralstat, compared with 123 while taking placebo, for an adjusted weekly attack rate of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.59-1.05) for the study drug, although the confidence interval included no effect. Thus, this study did not demonstrate a definite benefit. The drug was well-tolerated, but suboptimal oral bioavailability may have been a limiting factor. To overcome this problem, avoralstat has been replaced with a new molecule (BCX7353) that has an improved pharmacokinetic profile and is in clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-general-care-and-long-term-prophylaxis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. The phase II study showed a 73 percent reduction in attacks compared with placebo.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A human monoclonal antibody to plasma kallikrein, lanadelumab, is also under development. This agent has a long half-life, which would be a potential advantage over available prophylactic therapies in terms of efficacy. In a phase 1 study, 32 healthy subjects tolerated injections of different doses of the antibody without increased adverse effects, compared with subjects receiving placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-general-care-and-long-term-prophylaxis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. In a phase 1b study, two doses of lanadelumab given 14 days apart reduced attack rates by between 88 and 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-general-care-and-long-term-prophylaxis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Preliminary results of a phase 3 clinical trial involving 125 HAE patients showed a reduction in attacks ranging from 73 to 87 percent, depending on the dose and timing.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3295073763\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Common triggers include dental and medical procedures, periods of stress, and certain medications, such as estrogens and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'General care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immediately upon diagnosis, clinicians should help construct a plan for emergency care, including how and where the patient will access treatment and education about the need to seek care in a medical facility for laryngeal attacks. Patients should be offered a medical identification bracelet and a written plan for treatment of acute attacks for use in emergency department care (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F70252\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef70252 \">form 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F62004\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef62004 \">form 2</a>).

Various factors should be considered when deciding how best to combine on-demand and long-term prophylactic therapies (eg, access to therapies, the likelihood of side effects from long-term prophylactic therapies, and the patient's preferences). Approaches differ somewhat around the world. (See <a href=\"#H230015922\" class=\"local\">'Approach to long-term prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The three groups of agents used for long-term prophylaxis are attenuated androgens, antifibrinolytics, and regularly injected plasma-derived C1 inhibitor (pdC1INH) or recombinant C1INH (rhC1INH) concentrate. Each agent has advantages and disadvantages (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F83115\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83115 \">table 1</a>). Attenuated androgens and C1INH concentrate are both highly effective, although androgens can have adverse effects in some patients, and C1INH concentrate is expensive. Antifibrinolytics are inexpensive and usually well-tolerated but significantly less effective than androgens or C1INH. (See <a href=\"#H362572486\" class=\"local\">'Choice of agent in specific groups'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Androgens are usually well-tolerated in postpubertal males. They should be avoided in growing children and pregnant or lactating women. Some women can tolerate androgens at relatively low doses. (See <a href=\"#H136389429\" class=\"local\">'Attenuated androgens'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Antifibrinolytics are most useful in growing children. They can be used in <span class=\"nowrap\">pregnant/lactating</span> women and patients with breast or prostate cancers, although pdC1INH would be preferred. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranexamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tranexamic acid</a> (TA) should be initiated at the relatively high dose of 3 grams per day (divided into two or three doses daily) and then tapered if symptoms are controlled. (See <a href=\"#H230015351\" class=\"local\">'Antifibrinolytics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Regular injections of pdC1INH are preferred for pregnant women and for patients who do not tolerate or do not wish to take androgens.
