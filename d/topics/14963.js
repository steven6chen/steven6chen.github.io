There is also a strong link between asthma and bacterial rhinosinusitis, viral upper respiratory infections (acute viral rhinosinusitis), and nasal polyposis.</p><p>Several experts propose that it is reasonable to consider patients with asthma as a subgroup of the larger population of patients with allergic rhinitis since allergic rhinitis is almost ubiquitous in patients with asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/relationships-between-rhinosinusitis-and-asthma/abstract/3-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-8</a>]. Position papers on allergic rhinitis, generated at international workshops in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/relationships-between-rhinosinusitis-and-asthma/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>] and endorsed by the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI) and by numerous other professional organizations internationally, have supported this view.</p><p>Rhinitis is defined as the presence of sneezing, rhinorrhea (anterior and posterior), nasal congestion, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nasal itching, arising from irritation and inflammation of the nasal passages. Rhinosinusitis describes disorders affecting both the nasal passages and paranasal sinuses. Symptoms of sinus involvement include nasal congestion, posterior nasal drainage, facial pressure and pain, headache, fatigue, and reduced sense of smell.</p><p>In most instances, the term &quot;rhinosinusitis&quot; is preferred to &quot;sinusitis&quot; since inflammation of the sinuses rarely occurs without concurrent inflammation of the nasal mucosa. However, &quot;rhinitis&quot; can occur without &quot;sinusitis.&quot; Patients with environmental allergies, especially seasonal (eg, pollens), can have rhinitis alone. In contrast, patients with perennial symptoms, usually associated with sensitization to indoor allergens (eg, dust mites, pet danders, fungi), often have prominent nasal congestion and posterior drainage, suggesting greater sinus involvement.</p><p>This topic reviews the epidemiologic, physiologic, and therapeutic evidence that supports the one airway hypothesis. Allergic rhinitis, acute and chronic rhinosinusitis, and asthma are covered in detail separately in numerous topics.

Conversely, asthma occurs in 25 to 50 percent of individuals with rhinitis. Adults with perennial rhinitis are more likely to have asthma than those without rhinitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/relationships-between-rhinosinusitis-and-asthma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The odds of developing asthma are 8-fold higher in patients with allergic rhinitis and almost 12-fold higher in subjects with nonallergic rhinitis.</p><p>Similar data are observed in children. In a cross-sectional study of 3000 randomly selected British schoolchildren whose families completed a survey, 53 percent of boys and 61 percent of girls with asthma had rhinitis symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/relationships-between-rhinosinusitis-and-asthma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In a second cross-sectional study of 2005 Greek children that used questionnaires, clinical evaluations, and provocation testing, 69 percent of children with asthma had rhinitis, whereas only 33 percent of those with rhinitis had asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/relationships-between-rhinosinusitis-and-asthma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The Copenhagen Allergy Study illustrates the prevalence of rhinitis in subjects with asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/relationships-between-rhinosinusitis-and-asthma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This population-based study examined the relationship between allergic rhinitis and allergic asthma in 700 subjects aged 15 to 69 years at two time points eight years apart. Diagnosis of allergy was based upon allergic respiratory symptoms and in vitro specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) testing. Findings were as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All 52 subjects with allergic asthma to pollen had concomitant allergic rhinitis to pollen at the second time point. Twenty-eight of these subjects were new cases.

More than two-thirds of subjects with severe asthma have sinus disease. In approximately 5000 adult subjects from an allergy clinic, nasal polyps occurred in 4.2 percent and were associated more commonly with asthma than with rhinitis alone (6.7 percent versus 2.2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/relationships-between-rhinosinusitis-and-asthma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

The combined effects of allergen sensitization, exposure to perennial aeroallergens, and viral infection increase the risk of hospitalization for asthma in adults (odds ratio [OR] 8.4, 95% CI 2.1-32.8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/relationships-between-rhinosinusitis-and-asthma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More than two-thirds of individuals with asthma have symptoms of rhinosinusitis.

None of these individuals had a diagnosis of asthma or symptoms compatible with asthma at the time of their first evaluation. However, 162 had a diagnosis of rhinitis. The incidence of asthma over 23 years was 10.5 percent in subjects with rhinitis and 3.6 percent in those without rhinitis. This study suggests that subjects with allergic rhinitis are three times more likely to develop asthma than those without allergic rhinitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The European Community Respiratory Survey, a longitudinal, population-based study, found that rhinitis, either allergic or nonallergic, was predictive of the development of adult-onset asthma in 6461 adult subjects without asthma at baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/relationships-between-rhinosinusitis-and-asthma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The adjusted relative risk of asthma over approximately nine years was 1.63 (95% CI 0.82-3.24) for &quot;atopy only&quot; (positive prick skin tests for one or more allergens; no rhinitis), 2.71 (95% CI 1.64-4.46) for nonallergic rhinitis, and 3.53 (95% CI 2.11-5.91) for allergic rhinitis.

This study compared 173 adults who developed asthma over 10 years with 2177 control subjects who, during the same approximate period, did not have any chronic lower respiratory tract symptoms. They controlled for several confounding variables, including smoking status and concomitant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The odds ratio (OR) for developing asthma was 2.59 (95% CI 1.54-4.34) if rhinitis was present and was 6.28 (95% CI 4.01-9.82) if both rhinitis and rhinosinusitis were present. The risk for asthma increased with the persistence or severity of rhinitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A birth cohort study examined risk factors for persistent wheezing at six years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/relationships-between-rhinosinusitis-and-asthma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Persistent asthma at six years of age was associated with inhalant allergy, with positive skin tests to aeroallergens and rhinitis independent of colds. These continue to be markers of asthma persistence through adolescence and adult life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/relationships-between-rhinosinusitis-and-asthma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPARATIVE ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The structure of the airway mucosa is similar in the nose and bronchi.

However, there are several differences. Keratinized and unkeratinized stratified squamous epithelium are present in the nasal vestibule. Cartilage is found from nasal fossa to the bronchi only.

Spontaneous breathing during the exercise challenge resulted in bronchoconstriction, with a decrease in FEV<sub>1</sub>. Oral breathing exaggerated the airway hyperreactivity, and nasal breathing abrogated the bronchoconstrictive response.

Some investigators have countered that substances produced during allergic reactions can enter the gaseous phase, become aerosolized, and disseminate throughout the lower respiratory tract, thus potentially producing bronchoprovocation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/relationships-between-rhinosinusitis-and-asthma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Investigators have increasingly focused on systemic propagation of inflammation as the principal connection between the upper and lower airways in patients with allergic respiratory disease. As mentioned above, similar cellular infiltrates and proinflammatory mediators are present in both the nasal and bronchial mucosa in patients with rhinosinusitis and asthma (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Airway inflammation'</a> above). Additional studies suggest further evidence of systemic cross-talk. Allergen provocation can lead to inflammatory cell production in the bone marrow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/relationships-between-rhinosinusitis-and-asthma/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Patients with asthma and allergic rhinitis have increased numbers of eosinophils, mast cells, and T cells in duodenal biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/relationships-between-rhinosinusitis-and-asthma/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Nasal allergen challenge in patients with seasonal rhinitis and no bronchial responsiveness has yielded increases in eosinophils (both endobronchial and circulating) and endobronchial adhesion molecules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/relationships-between-rhinosinusitis-and-asthma/abstract/33,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,61</a>]. These findings suggest that allergic airway inflammation leads to recruitment of eosinophils into the systemic circulation, which then leads to inflammation of respiratory mucosa not exposed to the culprit allergen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">THERAPEUTIC EVIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Upper airway disease is thought to aggravate or cause lower airway disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/relationships-between-rhinosinusitis-and-asthma/abstract/10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12</a>].
