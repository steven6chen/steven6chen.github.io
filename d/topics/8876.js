This is due to many underlying factors, including the uremic milieu, elevated levels of circulating proinflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, carbonyl stress, protein-energy wasting (PEW), enhanced incidence of infections (especially dialysis access related), and others. Although the definition of inflammation is unclear in this setting, CKD-associated chronic inflammation, as assessed by increased C-reactive protein (CRP) levels above 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> over at least three months, has been reported in 30 to 60 percent of North American and European dialysis patients, with dialysis patients in Asian countries possibly having a lower prevalence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency/abstract/1-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-7</a>].</p><p>The acute-phase response is a major pathophysiologic phenomenon that accompanies inflammation. With this reaction, normal homeostatic mechanisms are replaced by new set points that presumably contribute to defensive or adaptive capabilities.</p><p>Acute-phase proteins are defined as those proteins whose plasma concentrations increase (positive acute-phase proteins), such as CRP, or decrease (negative acute-phase proteins), such as albumin, during inflammatory states. Measurement of the levels of these proteins is frequently utilized to define the presence <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> degree of inflammation in a given patient. A number of inflammatory markers have been studied in patients with CKD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F75907\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75907 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-phase-reactants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute phase reactants&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Despite its name, the &quot;acute&quot;-phase response can persist over months to years and become chronic. In such states of chronic inflammation, positive acute-phase proteins including CRP (normal range &lt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L)</span> may be slightly but persistently increased, which can predispose to an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD; CRP 1 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, in many CKD patients, especially in maintenance dialysis patients, serum CRP levels are persistently between 5 and 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L,</span> although they may fluctuate widely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. During acute and fulminant infections, such as acute osteomyelitis, serum CRP is usually above 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F67050\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67050 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Among patients with CKD, the presence of an inflammatory state may also be closely related to accelerated atherogenesis, protein-energy malnutrition (PEM, also referred to as PEW), and anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal insufficiency alone is reported to be a risk factor for atherosclerosis and CVD. This may be due in part to concurrent inflammation.

As an example, the serum half-lives of proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin (IL)-1 are greater in animals without renal function than those with renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>In humans, declining renal function may also affect the levels of additional inflammatory molecules as serum C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, and hyaluronan levels are inversely correlated with creatinine clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>], although inflammation may have a bidirectional relationship with kidney function, being not only a consequence but also a cause for loss of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In addition, among end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients with residual renal function, higher serum CRP concentrations are observed among those with relatively less native kidney function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Increased production of cytokines may also be observed.

Oxidative stress, which occurs when there is excessive free-radical production or low antioxidant levels, could be an important condition for the development of endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and atherogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coronary artery endothelial dysfunction: Clinical aspects&quot;</a>). Lower plasmalogen levels, an indicator of such stress, have been reported in malnourished and inflamed patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>With renal failure, molecules that are not cytokines may also accumulate and provoke an inflammatory response. As an example, advanced glycosylated end products (AGEs), which result from carbonyl stress, can clearly initiate inflammation in patients with renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].

In addition, an increased susceptibility to infections has been described in dialysis patients that may be partly due to uremia, old age, and comorbid conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Other factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A systemic autoimmune condition (which may have resulted in kidney disease), genetic factors, an unrecognized persistent infection, periodontal diseases, and atherosclerosis may also underlie inflammation among patients with decreased renal function or end-stage disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency/abstract/37-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-40</a>].

Routine monitoring of inflammatory markers in all end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients is not recommended by most guidelines, although it may improve patient management. Periodic measurement of C-reactive protein (CRP) or interleukin (IL)-6 to assess severity and frequency of inflammation is reasonable in select patients as part of an individualized work-up prompted by specific clinical characteristics, such as protein-energy wasting (PEW).</p><p>Several measures of general inflammation are used in both CKD and ESRD patients as well as in others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency/abstract/57-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-67</a>]. These include the following proteins:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum levels of positive acute-phase reactants, such as serum CRP, ferritin, or fibrinogen, are commonly elevated during an acute episode of inflammation. There is increasing literature on elevated serum CRP and increased cardiovascular risk, a relationship that is independent of other coronary risk factors.

Many negative acute-phase reactants are also traditionally utilized as nutritional markers since their serum levels are decreased with a decline in nutritional status.</p><p/><p>Since episodes of occult or overt inflammation may be chronic or recurrent, they have occasionally been referred to as representing a &quot;chronic&quot; acute-phase response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. Such chronic inflammatory responses are associated with an elevation of serum acute-phase proteins including CRP, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum amyloid A, and some proinflammatory cytokines including a variety of interleukins. Among the proinflammatory cytokines, IL-6 may have a central role in the pathophysiology of inflammation in patients with renal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p>No consensus exists as to what threshold levels of inflammatory markers optimally distinguish noninflamed versus inflamed patients with ESRD, as well as what exact markers should be measured.

In a small clinical trial, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation alleviated some markers of inflammation in hemodialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency/abstract/155\" class=\"abstract_t\">155</a>] and in patients with advanced nondialysis-dependent CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency/abstract/156\" class=\"abstract_t\">156</a>]. Fish oil administration in patients with CKD has also been shown to lower some (but not all) inflammatory markers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency/abstract/157\" class=\"abstract_t\">157</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vitamin D has multiple effects that have been invoked as potential explanations for its association with improved survival in patients with CKD and ESRD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency/abstract/158\" class=\"abstract_t\">158</a>]. One such effect is modulation of the inflammatory reaction. In a small proof-of-concept clinical trial, the administration of the selective vitamin D receptor activator, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paricalcitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paricalcitol</a>, resulted in significant reduction in CRP, IL-6, and TNF-alpha levels in patients with advanced nondialysis-dependent CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency/abstract/159\" class=\"abstract_t\">159</a>]. However, in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial including 46 patients with early CKD, high-dose cholecalciferol supplementation did not result in a significant change in most measured markers of inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency/abstract/160\" class=\"abstract_t\">160</a>]. Furthermore, in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of ergocalciferol supplementation in 276 patients with ESRD on hemodialysis, ergocalciferol supplementation for six months resulted in no significant change in CRP levels (among other outcomes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency/abstract/161\" class=\"abstract_t\">161</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>L-carnitine deficiency is common in dialysis patients. A systematic meta-analysis of clinical trials examining the effects of L-carnitine supplementation in hemodialysis patients indicated that this therapy resulted in a significant reduction in CRP levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency/abstract/162\" class=\"abstract_t\">162</a>].</p><p/><p>In addition to the above agents with complex mechanisms of action, there are multiple &quot;designer&quot; drugs that target a specific aspect of the inflammatory cascade. These drugs have applications mainly in rheumatoid arthritis, and most of them will likely not be utilized in patients with CKD. However, some agents are considered for patients with CKD:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Etanercept</a> &ndash; Etanercept is an anti-TNF agent that is effective in the treatment of various forms of inflammatory arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. In a pilot study involving 10 chronic hemodialysis patients, the administration of etanercept over 44 weeks appeared safe but resulted only in small improvement in prealbumin concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency/abstract/163\" class=\"abstract_t\">163</a>]. A phase-II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial examining the effectiveness of etanercept in improving serum albumin and CRP levels of hemodialysis patients was terminated due to insufficient patient enrollment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency/abstract/164\" class=\"abstract_t\">164</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentoxifylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pentoxifylline</a> &ndash; Pentoxifylline is a nonspecific phosphodiesterase inhibitor that inhibits TNF transcription [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency/abstract/165\" class=\"abstract_t\">165</a>].

The Anti-Inflammatory and Anti-Oxidative Nutrition in Dialysis Patients (AIONID) study was sponsored by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) and examined the effect of oral nutritional supplements with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties along with pentoxifylline therapy in a factorial design on malnutrition and inflammation in 100 patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis. Daily intake of a high-protein nutritional supplement with anti-inflammatory and antioxidative ingredients resulted in a slight but significant increase in serum albumin levels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other studies that tested the efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentoxifylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentoxifylline</a> were less successful in alleviating inflammation. In a small clinical trial of 71 adult patients with elevated CRP, the administration of 400 mg of pentoxifylline thrice weekly did not result in significant changes in serum hepcidin level compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency/abstract/167\" class=\"abstract_t\">167</a>]. This study did not test the effects of pentoxifylline on markers of inflammation such as CRP. Early-phase clinical trials are examining the pentoxifylline derivative CTP-499 as a treatment in diabetic nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency/abstract/168,169\" class=\"abstract_t\">168,169</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IL-1 receptor antagonists &ndash; Anakinra is a human recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist that is used in rheumatoid arthritis. It also shows some promise in the treatment of inflammation in patients with CKD. A single study examined the pharmacokinetics of this drug in patients with impaired renal function, showing that the main route of elimination for anakinra is renal clearance and that hemodialysis has a very small effect on clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency/abstract/170\" class=\"abstract_t\">170</a>]. The results of this study indicate that thrice-weekly dosing of anakinra may be possible. The safety and efficacy of anakinra in chronic hemodialysis patients was examined in a randomized, controlled clinical trial. This study reported significant beneficial effects of anakinra on serum CRP and IL-6 levels but no effects on serum albumin, prealbumin, and lean body mass levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency/abstract/171\" class=\"abstract_t\">171</a>]. A study examining the effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rilonacept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rilonacept</a> (another IL-1 receptor antagonist) on inflammatory markers, endothelial function, oxidative stress, insulin resistance, pulse wave velocity, urinary cytokines, and proteinuria in patients with nondialysis-dependent CKD is being conducted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency/abstract/172\" class=\"abstract_t\">172</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rituximab</a> &ndash; Rituximab is a B-cell-depleting monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency/abstract/173\" class=\"abstract_t\">173</a>]. B-cell depletion affects the levels of autoantibodies that play important roles in the pathophysiology of diseases such as rheumatoid factor in rheumatoid arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency/abstract/174,175\" class=\"abstract_t\">174,175</a>], systemic lupus erythematosus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency/abstract/176\" class=\"abstract_t\">176</a>], and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency/abstract/177-179\" class=\"abstract_t\">177-179</a>].

It is unclear if this agent will be employed for the treatment of chronic inflammation in CKD since the autoantibody depletion resultant after B-cell depletion may be more specific to certain types of diseases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemokine inhibitors &ndash; Several agents targeting chemokine pathways have been evaluated for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy, such as C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency/abstract/185\" class=\"abstract_t\">185</a>], the C-C motif-ligand 2 (CCL2) (ie, monocyte chemotactic protein 1) inhibitor emapticap pegol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency/abstract/186\" class=\"abstract_t\">186</a>], or the Janus kinase 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">(JAK1)/Janus</span> kinase 2 (JAK2) inhibitor baricitinib [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency/abstract/187\" class=\"abstract_t\">187</a>].

As an example, the use of biocompatible membranes decreases serum levels of CRP, although such interventions may not completely normalize its serum concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].

This is due to many underlying factors, including the uremic milieu, elevated levels of circulating proinflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, carbonyl stress, protein-energy wasting (PEW), enhanced incidence of infections (especially dialysis access related), and others. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Inflammation and kidney disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine monitoring of inflammatory markers in all ESRD or CKD patients is not recommended by most guidelines, although it may improve patient management. Periodic measurement of C-reactive protein (CRP) or interleukin (IL)-6 to assess severity and frequency of inflammation is reasonable in select patients as part of an individualized work-up prompted by specific clinical characteristics, such as PEW. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'General markers of inflammation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of elevated inflammatory markers (eg, CRP &gt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> or 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> in ESRD or CKD patients should prompt a search for immediately treatable causes of acute or chronic inflammation, such as occult infections, volume overload, inadequate dialysis treatment, PEW, or the presence of a nonfunctioning renal allograft. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Management issues'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No pharmacologic interventions are recommended to target specifically chronic inflammation. However, several pharmacologic and nutritional interventions are undergoing early clinical trials for this indication. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Management issues'</a> above and <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Novel approaches'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Yeun JY, Levine RA, Mantadilok V, Kaysen GA.
