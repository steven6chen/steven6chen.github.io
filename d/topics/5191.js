This concept allows for survival of tissues in isolation, but it requires the loss of integrated function of various organ systems. Death of the brain therefore qualifies as death, as the brain is essential for integrating critical functions of the body. The equivalence of brain death with death is largely, although not universally, accepted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Brain death implies the permanent absence of cerebral and brainstem functions. Although the term &quot;brain dead&quot; is often used colloquially and to extend to all those with severe brain damage and those in vegetative states, in medical-legal terms, its meaning is very specific. Persistent vegetative state is described elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury-in-adults-evaluation-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in adults: Evaluation and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The concept of brain death, or the complete, irreversible cessation of brain function, including the capacity for brainstem, respiratory, and vegetative activities, was first described in 1959, predating widespread organ donation; although the latter made its codification critically necessary. While most countries have a legal provision for brain death, institutional protocols for diagnosis are not universal and are often absent, particularly in lower-income countries and in those without an organized transplant network [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Even among countries with an organized diagnostic protocol, there is substantial variation in the criteria that are used.</p><p>While United States law equates brain death with cardiopulmonary death, specific criteria for diagnosis are not mandated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Some states and institutions have specific diagnostic mandates, especially when applied to organ donor candidates. Most clinicians rely on published guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. However, a 2007 survey of prominent neurologic institutions in the United States found that there was considerable variability in adherence to published guidelines and clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Variable documentation of brain death criteria was also observed in a series of 142 children referred for organ donation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and in a chart review of 226 organ donors collected from 68 hospitals in the midwest United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>In most adult series, trauma and subarachnoid hemorrhage are the most common event leading to brain death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Others include intracerebral hemorrhage, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, and ischemic stroke. Any condition causing permanent widespread brain injury can lead to brain death.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL CRITERIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of brain death can usually be made clinically, at the bed side.

A warming blanket is required to achieve normothermia in many patients with brain death. There is little evidence base for a choice of threshold temperature.

Brain-originating movements include cortically originating complex, purposeful movements, and also decerebrate or decorticate posturing, facial grimacing, and seizures.</p><p>Movements originating from the spinal cord or peripheral nerve may occur in brain death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These are common (33 to 75 percent) and may be triggered by tactile stimuli or occur spontaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/10,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,18,19</a>].

Core temperature &ge;36&ordm;C or 97&ordm;F, systolic blood pressure &ge;100 mmHg, eucapnia (PaCO<sub>2</sub> 35 to 45 mmHg), absence of hypoxia, and euvolemic status are prerequisites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The test is not valid in patients who chronically have high PaCO<sub>2</sub> values (CO<sub>2</sub> retainers) and in cases of neuromuscular paralysis or high cervical spinal cord lesions. In a positive apnea test there is no respiratory response to a PaCO<sub>2</sub> &gt;60 mmHg or 20 mmHg greater than baseline values and a final arterial pH of &lt;7.28.</p><p>Disconnecting the ventilator is often associated with profound hypoxemia and hemodynamic instability. This can be obviated by increasing inspired oxygen before and during the test. Preoxygenation eliminates stores of respiratory nitrogen and accelerates oxygen transport through the tracheal cannula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The fraction of inspired oxygen should be 1.0 for 10 minutes, up to a maximum PaO<sub>2</sub> of 200 mmHg or until the PaCO<sub>2</sub> exceeds 40 mmHg. Ventilation frequency is reduced to eucapnia; positive end-expiratory pressure is reduced to 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. If SaO<sub>2</sub> &gt;95 percent, then an arterial blood gas (ABG) is obtained. The patient is then disconnected from the ventilator. Oxygen is provided by a tracheal cannula at 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/minute;</span> the tip should lie at the carina. Alternatives include using a T-piece system with oxygen flow at 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/minute</span> and using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) 10 to 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, with oxygen flow at 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/minute</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p>Visual observation is the standard method for detecting respiratory movement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Eight to 10 minutes with no observable respiratory effort is a standard observation period. PaCO<sub>2</sub> is measured just prior to reconnection to the ventilator to confirm that the target level (&gt;60 mmHg or 20 mmHg greater than baseline values) was achieved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H110962412\"><span class=\"h3\">Challenges and test modification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypotension (systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg), hypoxemia (SaO<sub>2</sub> &lt;85 percent for &gt;30 seconds), or cardiac arrhythmia may occur during the apnea and lead to abortion of the apnea test. These events may suggest inadequate oxygenation or preoxygenation, or baseline cardiopulmonary disease. While complications precluding the completion of the apnea test have been reported to occur in 10 to 26 percent of individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>], a more recent study found that with appropriate prerequisites (adequate preoxygenation, no acid-base or electrolyte abnormalities, normotension, and stable cardiac rhythm), the apnea test was completed without complication in most (62 of 63) patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. When aborted, the test can be reattempted using CPAP as described above; in one series this method allowed completion of the apnea test in 2 of 20 patients who could not complete it using tracheal cannula oxygen supply [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Ancillary tests are necessary if the apnea test cannot be completed. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Ancillary tests'</a> below.)</p><p>An innovation in the apnea test involves introducing 3 to 5 percent CO<sub>2</sub> along with oxygen and providing approximately four breaths per minute using a ventilator that is capable of detecting respiratory effort, while monitoring the end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, other authors have criticized CO<sub>2</sub> supplementation techniques because rates of PaCO<sub>2</sub> accumulations may be unpredictable, excessive hypercarbia can cause complications, and more gradual increases in PaCO<sub>2</sub> may not effectively stimulate respiratory centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. PaCO<sub>2</sub> increases at a rate of 2.5 to 3 mmHg per minute in traditional testing.</p><p>Case reports have drawn attention to potential diagnostic confusion that may arise in the setting of spurious ventilator triggering by patients with apnea test-confirmed brain death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. Sensitive flow trigger settings on new-generation ventilators lead to ventilator self-cycling, which may be misinterpreted as respiratory effort. Increasing the trigger flow sensitivity threshold or changing to a pressure trigger mechanism eliminates this phenomenon. However, determination of apnea can only be assessed reliably by disconnecting the ventilator as described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>False evidence of spontaneous breathing has also been reported, even before apnea testing is performed, on patients on pressure support ventilation in which the threshold for triggering the ventilator is set so low that a hyperdynamic precordium can lead pressure changes to cause the ventilator to provide &quot;breaths&quot; with low threshold settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Formal apnea testing should be performed if this phenomenon seems likely.</p><p>The apnea test requires modification in patients who have been resuscitated using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), but has been shown to be feasible in a number of case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. One literature review summarizes a procedure that includes decreasing the sweep rate to achieve hypercapnia, maintaining oxygenation through oxygen circuit delivery or by supplementation through the endotracheal tube, maintenance of CPAP and hemodynamic support with circuit pump flow, and vasoactive medications as needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Observation period</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The length of observation required to determine brain death varies extensively. A follow-up evaluation after 24 hours was an early requirement for brain death diagnosis in the United States. Later, requirements in this regard were made age dependent: a 48-hour evaluation interval for infants age seven days to two months, 24 hours for those greater than two months to one year, and 12 hours for those between 1 and 18 years. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Brain death in children'</a> below.).</p><p>An observation period for adults is considered optional; six hours is often recommended, with longer periods, up to 24 hours, recommended in cases of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Guidelines in other countries recommend longer observation periods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/3,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,30</a>]. The American Academy of Neurology guideline update published in 2010 found insufficient evidence to determine a minimally acceptable observation period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In patients who have been resuscitated after cardiac arrest, we recommend observation for at least 24 hours from the time of the arrest, as spontaneous improvement in brainstem reflexes can occur hours after cardiac arrest. In such patients who have received induced hypothermia, the recovery time may be further extended, as some motor and brainstem reflexes may recover after being absent for three days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. It may be advisable to perform an ancillary test of brain blood flow with such patients; electrophysiologic parameters may also be affected by induced hypothermia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury-in-adults-evaluation-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in adults: Evaluation and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are limited studies of serial examinations in this setting upon which to base recommendations for a required length of observation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. One case series reviewed data from 1229 adult and 82 pediatric (greater than one year of age) cases of brain death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The interval between first and second examinations ranged from 3 to over 50 hours (mean 19.2 hours). None of the patients with an initial examination consistent with brain death regained brainstem function on repeat examination. However, rates of organ donation decreased with longer intervals between examinations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Examiner(s)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The expertise of the examiners required to make a diagnosis of brain death varies by state and country [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/3,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,6</a>]. Some states (eg, Virginia) specifically require the physician to be a specialist in the neurosciences, while others (Alaska, Georgia) give authority to nurses with subsequent certification by a physician. States and countries also differ as to whether more than one physician is required to certify a patient as brain dead [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/3,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,30</a>].</p><p>The examiner making the diagnosis of brain death should be familiar with the clinical criteria and comfortable in performing all aspects of the examination. A systematic review of the literature found that the precision of the neurologic examination in comatose patients is moderate to substantial; only one study found diminished precision in less-experienced examiners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Simulation-based training may improve the examiner's performance, at least in the short term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p>Another common requirement or recommendation is that the brain death examiner be someone other than the treating physician. In addition, when organ donation is being considered, the examiner should not be the same physician or surgeon who is part of the transplant team or has responsibilities to the potential recipient of one or more organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/17,30,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,30,35</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">ANCILLARY TESTS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H110962429\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A valid, complete clinical examination is sufficient and superior to diagnostic testing in the diagnosis of brain death in adults.

Studies examining their utility are limited; they are generally quite small and often examine only clinically brain dead individuals, not allowing for detection of false-positive errors. Individual tests have different strengths and weaknesses in different clinical situations, which may guide their selection.</p><p>Cerebral angiography best approximates a &quot;gold standard&quot; but is invasive, risky, and may be inaccurate (as are other tests of blood flow) in profound hypotension and when the cranial vault is breached by trauma, surgery, ventricular drain, or open cranial sutures. Under these circumstances an electrophysiologic test (electroencephalography [EEG] or somatosensory evoked potentials [SSEP]) may be superior. However, tests of cerebral blood flow are less subject to confounding by hypothermia, drugs, and metabolic factors than are electrophysiologic tests. For this reason, tests of cerebral blood flow are the most useful in those clinical settings in which the clinical criteria cannot be applied. SSEPs should not be used if the primary pathology is in the brainstem or in the setting of underlying neuropathy. EEG, evoked potentials (EPs), and transcranial Doppler (TCD) may be done at the bedside. The availability of different testing modalities and the requisite experience and expertise differ among institutions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H112519888\"><span class=\"h2\">Brain blood flow</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tests demonstrating absent blood flow to the brain are generally accepted as establishing whole brain death; it is axiomatic that the brain without a blood supply is dead. It does not always follow that the presence of some arterial blood flow in the intracranial compartment precludes the diagnosis of brain death.</p><p>Brain death is usually accompanied by elevated intracranial pressure from tissue edema or other mass effect. When this exceeds systemic arterial pressure, there is no cerebral blood flow.</p><p>Some intracranial arterial filling at the base of the brain without tissue perfusion can be seen in brain death, producing a &quot;false-negative&quot; test result for brain death. More refined techniques that examine brain perfusion are likely to be more accurate. Such tests include computed tomography (CT) perfusion studies (not widely available) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], radionuclide studies (see <a href=\"#H112519923\" class=\"local\">'Nuclear medicine'</a> below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], and magnetic resonance perfusion studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-41</a>]. Absent opacification of deep cerebral veins on conventional or CT angiography (CTA) may be more sensitive for brain death than filling of cerebral arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>].

These tests are not confounded by drugs, metabolic disorders, or hypothermia. A caveat is that the systemic blood pressure should be adequate (ie, the patient should not be in shock) when these tests are applied.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H112519895\"><span class=\"h3\">Cerebral angiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Four-vessel conventional cerebral angiography is the traditional gold standard among cerebral blood flow tests for brain death. The test is invasive and requires transportation to the radiology department. Blood pressure must be monitored during the procedure, as patients are often hemodynamically unstable. In addition, a severely damaged brain may have lost autoregulation, causing blood flow to vary with changes in perfusion pressure.</p><p>In cases of brain death, cerebral angiography usually demonstrates absent blood flow at or beyond the carotid bifurcation or circle of Willis. The external carotid system should be patent. In a minority of cases, angiography may demonstrate contrast stasis or delayed filling in intracranial arteries, perhaps as an evolutionary stage preceding absent filling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. False-negative cerebral angiograms showing normal-appearing blood flow in at least some intracranial blood vessels are reported to occur when intracranial pressure is lowered by surgery, trauma, and ventricular shunts or in infants with pliable skulls.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H112519902\"><span class=\"h3\">Transcranial Doppler</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TCD is safe, noninvasive, and inexpensive, and it can be done at the bedside. The test requires expertise; both anterior and posterior circulations should be evaluated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Findings of small systolic peaks without diastolic flow or a reverberating flow pattern suggest high vascular resistance and support the diagnosis of brain death. Limitations include a 10 to 25 percent prevalence of temporal bone thickening that precludes evaluation of 6 of the usual 11 insonated intracranial arteries. Because of these and other technical limitations, absence of arterial signals on TCD (a finding in 9 percent of brain dead patients) is considered nondiagnostic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. Both false-positive and false-negative tests (compared with cerebral angiography or other standard) are reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-51</a>].</p><p>As with cerebral angiography, patients with external ventricular drains or large craniotomies may have false-negative testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/45,51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,51,52</a>]. Caution should also be exercised with very young children, at least until further studies are done in this population.</p><p>In one study comparing 61 patients with clinical brain death with 39 control patients in coma but not brain dead, the sensitivity of TCD was 70.5 percent, and the specificity was 97.4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Similar results were observed in a case-control study of 101 comatose patients in which it was also observed that both sensitivity and specificity improved over time to 100 percent for examinations performed 24 hours or more after clinical diagnosis of brain death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H112519909\"><span class=\"h3\">Magnetic resonance angiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Absence of arterial blood flow on MRA supports the diagnosis of brain death. In addition, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) also shows variable degrees of cerebral edema and mass effect.

Disadvantages include that patients are required to lie flat and that there may be short periods of time in which clinical monitoring is impossible, making this somewhat problematic in unstable patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H112519916\"><span class=\"h3\">Computed tomographic angiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical utility of CTA and CT perfusion in the evaluation of brain death is uncertain, but appears to be similar to other ancillary studies. These tests are somewhat more invasive than MRA, in that contrast injection is required. Case reports document findings of absent cerebral circulation perfusion on CTA in patients with brain death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/57-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-60</a>]. However, systematic reviews of studies comparing CTA with an alternative brain death determination have concluded that the reported sensitivities are variable and appear low overall (ranging from 62 to 99&nbsp;percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. The highest sensitivity was achieved when the absence of opacification of the internal cerebral veins was used as a criterion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The absence of studies examining CTA findings in patients who are comatose but not brain dead precludes an assessment of this test's specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/6,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,62</a>]. In one series of 18 patients undergoing evaluation for brain death, the sensitivity and specificity of CTA was 75 and 100 percent, respectively, when compared with either clinical examination <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> conventional angiography; all nine patients who underwent both CTA and conventional angiography had concordant results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H112519923\"><span class=\"h3\">Nuclear medicine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common radionuclide modality for brain imaging uses the tracer, 99mTc-labeled hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HMPAO), and subsequent imaging with single-photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) brain scintigraphy. The tracer penetrates into the brain parenchyma in proportion to regional blood flow and shows no significant redistribution for several hours, making it easy to perform and interpret imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. The absence of isotope uptake (&quot;hollow skull phenomenon&quot;) indicates no brain perfusion and supports the diagnosis of brain death (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F76427\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76427 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Studies find that HMPAO-SPECT is useful in the diagnosis of brain death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/65-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">65-68</a>]. The sensitivity improves on follow-up examination in 24 to 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68</a>]. In studies with small &quot;control&quot; groups of brain injured, but not brain dead individuals, there were no false-positive studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>]. HMPAO-SPECT also appears to be useful in pediatric patients, although the examination in very young infants with open cranial sutures also appears to be subject to false-negative error, at least on initial examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. A false-positive appearance of absent brain blood flow was described in an infant in whom brain blood flow was assessed by SPECT in a single imaging plane; this emphasizes the importance of imaging in both anterior and lateral views [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrophysiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electrophysiologic tests used in the diagnosis of brain death include EEG and EPs. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Electroencephalography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electrocerebral silence or a flat EEG was a component of brain death declaration with the first guidelines published.

EEG remains strongly recommended in the United States and is an essential part of the American criteria for the diagnosis of brain death in very young children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. However, although the flat or suppressed recording prompts clinicians to consider brain death, EEG is anatomically and physiologically limited for this purpose.</p><p>The EEG records summated synaptic potentials from the cerebral neocortex and does not reveal potentials from subcortical structures, such as the brainstem or thalamus. Hence, the EEG may be flat or isoelectric in the presence of viable neurons in the brainstem and elsewhere. The EEG is also vulnerable to confounders, and it may be flat or isoelectric in cases of sedation from medication or toxic ingestion, hypothermia, or metabolic factors (conditions that do not necessarily imply complete and irreversible brain injury). A number of false-positive cases of flat EEG recordings in these situations have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/73,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,74</a>]. In addition, especially in the ICU, some electrical signals are recorded for which the source cannot be identified, even though they probably do not arise from the brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Such artifacts may be mistaken for residual cortical activity, producing a false-negative error.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Evoked potentials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SSEPs and brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) also have limited utility as ancillary tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/76-78\" class=\"abstract_t\">76-78</a>]. In SSEPs, the bilateral absence of the parietal sensory cortex responses (N19-P22) in response to median nerve stimulation is supportive of brain death. The absence of brainstem responses to an auditory stimulus (Waves III to V) in the presence of preserved cochlear response (Wave I) is required for a BAEP result to support the diagnosis of brain death.</p><p>Each test activates a discrete sensory pathway and extends the electrophysiologic interrogation beyond the EEG to areas of interest in the brainstem. However, these are highly specific, restricted pathways; EPs do not test the functional integrity of other central nervous system (CNS) structures. For both SSEP and BAEP, restricted proximal lesions, including those outside the CNS, may eliminate cortical response. Cases of preserved EEG integrity in the face of absent EPs have been described in individuals with primary brainstem pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p>Unlike EEG signals, the early components of SSEPs and BAEPs are minimally affected by sedative drugs and anesthetics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. However, hypothermia, drugs, and metabolic derangements can affect middle and late somatosensory and auditory potentials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. Some have argued that the combination of BAEPs and SSEPs with EEG offers greater assurance of an accurate diagnosis of brain death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. However, the requirement for an intact Wave I in the BAEP limits its broad applicability, as the cochlear end organ is frequently damaged in trauma.</p><p>One series of EP testing in 130 clinically brain dead patients (ages 8 to 77 years) showed that BAEPs provided information in 29.2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. In these patients, BAEP excluded brain death in 4.6 percent, while confirming the diagnosis in 24.6 percent. In the same 130 patients, SSEPs were useful in 97 percent, confirmed brain death in 94 percent, and excluded the diagnosis in 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. A cohort study of 181 comatose patients found that the P14 responses on SSEP were uniformly absent in all 108 brain dead patients and uniformly present in the remaining non-brain dead patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].

Examinations should be performed by different attending physicians. Apnea testing may be performed by the same physician. An observation period of 24 hours for term newborns to 30 days of age, and 12 hours for infants and children (30 days to 18 years) is recommended. Assessments in neonates and infants should be performed by pediatric specialists with critical care training.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The first examination determines the child has met the accepted neurologic examination criteria for brain death.

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical setting'</a> above.)</p><p>In adults, brain death rarely lasts for more than a few days before it is followed by somatic death. Brain ischemia leads to sympathetic nervous system collapse, leading to vasodilation and cardiac dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].

In this series, 80 patients survived two weeks, 44 survived four weeks, 20 survived two months, and seven survived six months. Those with long survivals were very young (two newborns).

The states of New Jersey and New York have dealt with this by passing laws that require cardiopulmonary death as the definition of death in these patients. There may be other sources of controversy. While there is legal precedent for discontinuing life support over the family's objection, many advocate delay, education, support, and negotiation in such cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death/abstract/2,4,104,105\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,104,105</a>].
