However, in resource-limited countries, this possible modest benefit is outweighed by the risk of adverse effects, the risk of selection of drug resistance, and the impracticality of selection and distribution of antimicrobials for the number of individuals affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-diarrhea-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>An important exception is the treatment of severe cholera in outbreak settings, for which antibiotics can decrease the duration of illness and the volume of fluid losses, thus simplifying patient management during a complex emergency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-diarrhea-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Reports of resistance in <em>V. cholerae</em> are increasing; data on local susceptibility should therefore be used to guide treatment choices.

In several trials of patients with dysentery, antibiotics reduced the duration of diarrhea and fever in infections caused by <em>Shigella</em>, which is the most common cause of dysentery in resource-limited settings and can otherwise be associated with severe complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-diarrhea-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/4,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,30</a>]. </p><p>Treatment should be particularly targeted at those with higher risks of complications, including individuals with AIDS and the elderly. The choice of antimicrobial should be based on recent susceptibility data from <em>Shigella</em> strains isolated in the area, if available. Because resistance of <em>Shigella</em> to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a>, and nalidixic acid has become widespread in resource-limited settings, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> had become the drug of choice for all patients with acute bloody diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-diarrhea-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, resistance to ciprofloxacin has also widespread in many parts of the world, which highlights the increasing importance of local susceptibility data. If no such data are available, ciprofloxacin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> are reasonable first line antibiotics, although clinicians should be aware that failure due to resistance is possible and second line drugs may be required.

Multidrug resistance has been identified in nontyphoidal <em>Salmonella</em>, <em>Shigella</em> spp, and <em>V. cholerae</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-diarrhea-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/33-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-37</a>]; resistance complicates the antibiotic treatment of severely ill patients and the management of diarrheal outbreaks.

Cases of diarrhea can occur as baseline endemic disease or in the setting of epidemics. Poor sanitation is a major risk factor for the prevalence of diarrhea in both endemic and epidemic forms.

However, several other systemic complications can occur, including bacteremia, hemolytic-uremic syndrome, Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome, and reactive arthritis.
