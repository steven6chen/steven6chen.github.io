Anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy have not been shown to reduce the risk of embolism in IE. However, many patients with IE have indications for antithrombotic therapy, particularly patients with mechanical prosthetic valves.

However, patients with IE frequently have <span class=\"nowrap\">other/separate</span> indications for anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy and such therapy is appropriate if the potential benefit of antithrombotic therapy outweighs the potential risk. Data to guide the use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet therapies in the setting of IE are limited. Thus, recommendations are based largely on observational data and expert opinion. Since there are competing risks of thromboembolism and bleeding in every patient with IE, we individualize therapy based on a multidisciplinary approach to patient and disease factors. When weighing the potential risks and benefits of antithrombotic therapy in patients with IE, the magnitude of risk as well as the duration of the period of risk should be considered.</p><p>The management approach described here is largely consistent with the 2015 American Heart Association (AHA) IE scientific statement, the 2015 European Society of Cardiology IE guidelines, and the 2012 American College of Chest Physicians guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombotic-therapy-in-patients-with-infective-endocarditis/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H453760009\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical settings</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H453759037\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients without other indications for antithrombotic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with IE without a separate indication for anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy, initiation of anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy is not indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombotic-therapy-in-patients-with-infective-endocarditis/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. The available data do not demonstrate a convincing benefit for antithrombotic therapy in preventing embolic complications in patients with IE and suggest possible increased risk of bleeding complications.

The risk of thromboembolism and valve thrombosis in patients with prosthetic valves is summarized here and discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-mechanical-prosthetic-valve-thrombosis-or-obstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of mechanical prosthetic valve thrombosis or obstruction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithrombotic-therapy-for-prosthetic-heart-valves-indications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antithrombotic therapy for prosthetic heart valves: Indications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with prosthetic valves are at risk for thromboembolism as well as for valve obstruction from valve thrombosis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of <strong>thromboembolism</strong> is highest during the first 30 to 90 days after valve implantation in patients with bioprosthetic or mechanical valves. After that early period, the risk is higher in patients with mechanical valves if not treated with anticoagulation (vitamin K antagonist or heparin). In patients with mechanical aortic valves who are treated with vitamin K antagonist therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>), the long-term frequency of systemic embolization, predominantly cerebrovascular events, is approximately 0.7 to 1.0 percent per year (which is similar to the risk of embolization in patients with bioprosthetic valves without anticoagulant therapy). The risk of systemic embolization is approximately twice as high with a mitral valve. By comparison, the risk of embolization is 2.2 percent per year with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and 4.0 percent per year with no anticoagulation in patients with mechanical valves (data not specific for valve position). The risk of thromboembolism during the first 10 to 30 days after valve replacement is approximately 15 to 25 times higher than after the first 90 days. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prosthetic valve thrombosis</strong> may be asymptomatic but can progress to acute or chronic valvular obstruction with mortality rates greater than 35 percent in those who become critically ill with acute obstruction. The reported annual incidence of prosthetic valve thrombosis ranges from 0.03 to 5.7 percent with higher rates observed in patients with mechanical valves treated with subtherapeutic anticoagulation. The risk of valve obstruction from thrombosis is also higher in the presence of a mitral valve. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-mechanical-prosthetic-valve-thrombosis-or-obstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of mechanical prosthetic valve thrombosis or obstruction&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with acute valve thrombosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> large vegetations may require emergency surgical valve replacement or surgical removal of the thrombus though some patients (eg, those who are more stable and have smaller thrombi) may be treated by thrombolysis or anticoagulation. Management is discussed in detail separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-management-of-bioprosthetic-valve-thrombosis-and-obstruction#H953686112\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and management of bioprosthetic valve thrombosis and obstruction&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>). However, thrombolysis is contraindicated in patients with IE who have a stroke given the risk of hemorrhagic transformation or worsening intracerebral hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"#H453759693\" class=\"local\">'Ischemic stroke'</a> below.) </p><p/><p>We recommend anticoagulation in patients with mechanical valves based upon moderate quality evidence supporting long-term anticoagulation (with vitamin K antagonist) to reduce thromboembolism and valve thrombosis. Limited evidence is available comparing various regimens for bridging with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> or low molecular weight heparin until patients are stable on vitamin K anticoagulant therapy. In the early treatment of patients presenting with IE, vitamin K antagonist is replaced with unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin as discussed below.

Since patients presenting with acute IE may be at increased risk for major bleeding, we generally suspend addition of aspirin to anticoagulant therapy in this setting in the absence of other indications for antiplatelet therapy. </p><p>The risk of thromboembolism is increased early after bioprosthetic as well as mechanical valve replacement, though there is limited evidence on the efficacy of anticoagulant therapy early after bioprosthetic valve replacement. We suggest early antithrombotic therapy after bioprosthetic valve replacement, though recommendations vary among experts.

Although prophylactic anticoagulation is often warranted in this population, the risk of VTE must be balanced against the risk of bleeding complications including intracerebral hemorrhage, particularly in those who already have ischemic stroke and are thus at risk for hemorrhagic transformation. Given this risk, for hospitalized patients with IE with limited mobility, we suggest mechanical thromboprophylaxis (eg, intermittent pneumatic compression).

This includes continuing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> indefinitely in all patients with coronary stents, in addition to time-limited dual antiplatelet therapy.

However, there are few data to guide decisions about the initiation or continuation of antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention in patients who develop IE. Given the increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke in acute IE, we generally suspend antiplatelet therapy during treatment of IE. However, in the absence of bleeding complications, it is reasonable to continue antiplatelet therapy in acute IE for patients deemed to be at particularly high risk of recurrent noncardioembolic ischemic stroke because of factors such as recent transient ischemic attack (TIA) or high-grade stenosis of an extracranial or intracranial large artery. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H453760598\"><span class=\"h5\">Primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Aspirin</a> use modestly decreases the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction, cancer incidence, and overall mortality, but increases the risk of major bleeding in adults without established cardiovascular disease and with average cancer risk.

In patients at high risk of cardioembolic stroke other than IE alone (eg, a patient with a mechanical prosthetic valve, particularly if high-risk features are present), cautious anticoagulation may be continued if a small ischemic stroke is identified, although this recommendation is controversial. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithrombotic-treatment-of-acute-ischemic-stroke-and-transient-ischemic-attack\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antithrombotic treatment of acute ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In patients with IE in whom a decision is made to continue anticoagulant therapy (eg, for a mechanical valve), we generally replace vitamin K antagonist therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>) with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> or low molecular weight heparin therapy at the time of presentation while stability and potential need for an invasive procedure is assessed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombotic-therapy-in-patients-with-infective-endocarditis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The switch is made so that anticoagulation can be quickly reversed should an indication for an invasive procedure develop or should a contraindication to anticoagulation arise (eg, a stroke or a bleeding complication). We generally initiate unfractionated heparin without a bolus to reduce the risk of bleeding. Patients treated with unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin should have a baseline platelet count obtained before heparin is started, and every two or three days from day four until the heparin is stopped [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombotic-therapy-in-patients-with-infective-endocarditis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Those with a drop in platelet count should be evaluated for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Patients treated with unfractionated heparin should receive careful monitoring of the aPTT and strict avoidance of overanticoagulation.

Thus, in the setting of IE, antithrombotic therapy (antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents) should be immediately discontinued in all patients with serious or life-threatening bleeding (including intracerebral hemorrhage) and in most patients with ischemic stroke. In patients with serious or life-threatening bleeding, anticoagulation should also be reversed. Recommendations for reversal of anticoagulation differ in patients with and without mechanical prosthetic valves, given the risks of valve thrombosis and valve thromboembolism in patients with mechanical valves.

An exception applies to patients judged to have high risk of cardioembolic stroke (above the general risk of stroke associated with IE; eg, a patient with a mechanical valve with high-risk features) in whom cautious anticoagulation may be continued if the ischemic stroke is small, although this recommendation is controversial. This exception is not included in the 2015 AHA IE scientific statement.

For those who have been taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> or other vitamin K antagonist, reversal strategies depend upon the severity of the bleeding and the degree of anticoagulation. Rapid reversal of warfarin can be achieved using a four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate or fresh frozen plasma; longer-term reversal of warfarin (eg, for several days) is maintained by administering vitamin K. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reversal-of-anticoagulation-in-warfarin-associated-intracerebral-hemorrhage#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reversal of anticoagulation in warfarin-associated intracerebral hemorrhage&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.) </p><p>In patients with mechanical prosthetic valves, reversal of anticoagulation should be undertaken with care to avoid risk of precipitating valve thrombosis.
