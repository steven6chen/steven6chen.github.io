However, some studies have questioned the need for supplemental perioperative glucocorticoids beyond the maintenance dose.</p><p>The management of the surgical patient on chronic glucocorticoid therapy is reviewed here.

While etomidate has many benefits in specific clinical settings, it is best avoided in patients with possible HPA suppression. If it is used, patients need to receive glucocorticoid coverage perioperatively or be closely monitored for any clinical features suggestive of adrenal insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-management-of-the-surgical-patient-taking-glucocorticoids/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>In patients with possible HPA suppression, the presence of unexplained nausea, vomiting, hypotension, orthostasis, change in mental status, hyponatremia, or hyperkalemia should prompt checking a random cortisol and, depending on the urgency of the situation, may require empiric therapy with additional corticosteroids. Additionally, postoperative stressors, such as infection, myocardial infarction, bleeding, or other complications may also prompt the administration of additional glucocorticoids.</p><p>Patients who are taking glucocorticoids should be monitored carefully for infection postoperatively because glucocorticoids may suppress the fever response.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CORTISOL SECRETION DURING STRESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute physical or psychological stress activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, resulting in increased plasma corticotropin (ACTH) and serum cortisol concentrations. Stress exerts its effects by stimulating the hypothalamus to release ACTH secretagogues, with corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) being the most important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-management-of-the-surgical-patient-taking-glucocorticoids/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p>Surgery is one of the most potent activators of the HPA axis. The degree of activation of the HPA axis depends on both the type of surgery performed and the anesthetic agents used during the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-management-of-the-surgical-patient-taking-glucocorticoids/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Plasma ACTH concentrations increase at the time of incision and during surgery, but the greatest ACTH and cortisol secretion occurs during reversal of anesthesia, extubation, and, in the immediate postoperative recovery period, primarily in response to pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-management-of-the-surgical-patient-taking-glucocorticoids/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. The response is mediated by afferent nerve impulses since it can be abolished by interrupting the neural connections from the operative site, such as by sectioning the spinal cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-management-of-the-surgical-patient-taking-glucocorticoids/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], epidural anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-management-of-the-surgical-patient-taking-glucocorticoids/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], or local anesthesia. The plasma ACTH and serum cortisol responses to surgery can also be reduced by opiate drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-management-of-the-surgical-patient-taking-glucocorticoids/abstract/29,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,32</a>].</p><p>There is considerable variation in the increase in cortisol secretion among individuals undergoing surgery; this variability is in part due to concomitant medication use, age, and concurrent illness.</p><p>However, in general, cortisol secretion is proportional to the degree of surgical stress:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The normal basal secretion of cortisol from the adrenal gland is approximately 8 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During a minor surgery or illness, secretion of cortisol increases to approximately 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-management-of-the-surgical-patient-taking-glucocorticoids/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

This leads to adrenal atrophy and loss of cortisol secretory capability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-management-of-the-surgical-patient-taking-glucocorticoids/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>The time course for recovery of the HPA axis after stopping glucocorticoid therapy following a prolonged treatment course is variable and depends upon a variety of factors including the dose, time of day, and duration of glucocorticoid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-management-of-the-surgical-patient-taking-glucocorticoids/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. Drugs such as azole antifungal agents and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ritonavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ritonavir</a> that inhibit cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme pathway may result in increased serum level of glucocorticoids. Such combination may result in more pronounced suppression of HPA axis. A detailed drug history and the presence of Cushingoid features may help identify such patients.
