They can arise from mesenchymal tissue at any body site. </p><p>The surgical management of primary soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) of the extremities will be reviewed here. The clinical features, diagnosis, classification, and staging of primary STS of the extremity and radiation-associated sarcomas, as well as an overview of multimodality therapy as used for STS of the extremities and chest wall, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-histopathology-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging-of-soft-tissue-sarcoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, histopathology, diagnostic evaluation, and staging of soft tissue sarcoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-associated-sarcomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation-associated sarcomas&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-multimodality-treatment-for-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities-and-chest-wall\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of multimodality treatment for primary soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities and chest wall&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Because of their rarity and the frequent need for multimodality treatment, surgical management of STS should ideally be carried out in a center with expertise in the treatment of sarcomas. The surgical expertise of dedicated subspecialists improves clinical outcomes. In one study that examined outcomes of 375 patients with STS of the extremities, local recurrence rates were 1.3-fold higher in those referred only after definitive surgery and were 2.4-fold higher for patients not referred at any time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

To achieve these goals, radiation therapy (RT) combined with wide surgical resection is recommended for most patients with high-grade primary extremity STS, with some exceptions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The role of chemotherapy continues to be studied and debated.</p><p>Adjuvant radiation is often used to aid with local control when it is predicted that adequate margins will be difficult to achieve, usually around major nerves and blood vessels. The particular adjunctive therapy (chemotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> RT) chosen is based upon the size and grade of the tumor but also upon institutional expertise, experience, and preferences. (See <a href=\"#H844287515\" class=\"local\">'Adjunctive medical therapies'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-multimodality-treatment-for-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities-and-chest-wall#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of multimodality treatment for primary soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities and chest wall&quot;, section on 'Radiation therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-multimodality-treatment-for-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities-and-chest-wall#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of multimodality treatment for primary soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities and chest wall&quot;, section on 'Initial chemoradiotherapy for large high-grade STS'</a>.)</p><p>Wide local excision of STS involves excision of the sarcoma with an adequate margin of normal (uninvolved) tissue, leaving the tumor pseudocapsule (if one exists) intact and as part of the en bloc resection specimen. Following resection of small tumors, primary closure of the wound may be possible, but, for larger defects, rotation flaps or free flap reconstruction may be necessary. (See <a href=\"#H1572311993\" class=\"local\">'Sarcoma resection and reconstruction'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3972843860\" class=\"local\">'Soft tissue reconstruction'</a> below.)</p><p>Although it is rarely needed, primary amputation may be indicated for patients with large locally advanced or recurrent STS not amenable to resection or in those with severe medical comorbidities. If amputation is not accepted, RT alone is an alternative treatment for STS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This is also considered when there is widespread metastatic disease and long-term survival is unlikely. Although some early data suggested that STSs were relatively radioresistant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>], cell lines derived from sarcomas are no less radiosensitive compared with epithelial cell lines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Myxoid liposarcomas are a particularly radiosensitive subtype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, tumor size matters. Although local control can be readily obtained in small tumors, high RT doses may be needed for local control rates to exceed 90 percent for tumors of estimated volume that is 15 to 65 mL (approximately a sphere of 3 to 5 cm in diameter), which require high RT doses (&gt;75 Gy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. As most treatment volumes are relatively large, the late normal tissue changes resulting from these dose levels are clinically important in nearly all patients and must be considered. </p><p>Where available, techniques such as systemic chemotherapy with regional hyperthermia or regional chemotherapy (isolated limb perfusion, isolated limb infusion) may also be considered as a means of sparing the limb. (See <a href=\"#H3777189870\" class=\"local\">'Primary amputation'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-locally-recurrent-and-unresectable-locally-advanced-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of locally recurrent and unresectable, locally advanced soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities&quot;, section on 'Unresectable locally advanced disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3338801214\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION AND PREPARATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1012492078\"><span class=\"h2\">Preoperative imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is the most useful test for the initial local assessment of a soft tissue sarcoma (STS). The main site of distant metastatic disease is within the chest for most histologic tumor types, and assessment for distant disease is carried out with chest computed tomography (CT). The added value of fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) or integrated PET-CT over routine cross-sectional imaging is uncertain, and PET scans are not routinely recommended as a component of the initial staging workup of STS in consensus-based guidelines from the <a href=\"https://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp&amp;token=Uq9WYRsg9p/PSM9vt3rBGtHa7uSejixwk2tJVlS5LMeu0awaX/Er3fekhDozpt3zew+Yt0LRtO7qp5BoCEEM5YoFu3K3VNa+mIo9yk7LJGM=&amp;TOPIC_ID=109748\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)</a> and the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

The use of adjuvant radiation lessens the necessity for primary amputation or radical resection and results in reasonable functional outcomes and acceptable cancer outcomes without the significant morbidity and cosmetic deformity of radical surgery or amputation. Neoadjuvant RT is generally preferred over postoperative RT for most patients because of significantly lower rates of late treatment-related toxicity. However, surgical resections are more challenging in a previously irradiated field, and wound healing is challenging in this setting.

We reserve surgical excision without RT for patients with superficial low-grade tumors that are 5 cm or less in diameter, as well as for carefully selected patients with small, purely intramuscular or subcutaneous tumors, even if higher-grade, provided that adequate surgical margins can be obtained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Some patients with larger, low-grade lesions that can be resected with wide margins may be considered for surgery alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. For all other patients, including those with low-grade histology, we advise RT in addition to surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neoadjuvant therapy is most often considered in the setting of a large or recurrent high-grade tumor, particularly if limb salvage is an issue. In these situations, RT is most commonly selected with or without chemotherapy. The optimal neoadjuvant regimen and how best to integrate RT, chemotherapy, and surgery are unknown.

The appropriateness of adjuvant chemotherapy should be addressed on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the patient's performance status, comorbid factors (including age), disease location, tumor size, and histologic subtype. The potential for benefit must be discussed in the context of expected treatment-related toxicities, including sterility in younger individuals, cardiomyopathy, renal damage, second cancers, and overall impairment of quality of life.

These treatments are only available in a few centers in the United States, but, where available, they represent potentially limb-preserving options.

The resection should take place through tissues outside of the tumor pseudocapsule, if one exists, through apparently normal uninvolved tissue. Violation of the tumor (ie, intralesional surgery or a resection that results in gross or microscopic residual tumor) is associated with a higher local failure rate even if radiation therapy (RT) is used. In one report, for example, the local control rate in 95 patients with extremity STS treated with preoperative RT followed by resection was 47 versus 87 percent in patients with and without tumor violation, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2137607410\"><span class=\"h3\">Lower versus upper extremity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The general principles of resection of STS are similar in the upper and lower extremities. The main difference is that amputation is avoided whenever possible in the upper extremity, particularly for proximal tumors. No prosthesis comes close to replicating the function of a normal hand, whereas for the lower extremity, modern prosthesis can offer reasonably good ambulatory function and, in younger patients, can support vigorous sport activities. To this end, when a major nerve requires resection, tendon transfers and (at times) nerve grafts are used in the upper extremity. While this is also possible in the lower extremity, in general, the results are not as favorable. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H76873764\"><span class=\"h3\">Resection margins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The status of the surgical margins is the most important surgical variable that influences local control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities/abstract/7,8,16-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,16-22</a>]. Although a positive margin by itself is not associated with a survival detriment, a positive surgical margin increases the risk of a local recurrence, which in turn is a risk factor for distant metastasis and inferior long-term survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities/abstract/21,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,23</a>]. Even in patients treated with combined surgery and RT, the status of the surgical margins influences the rate of local recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities/abstract/19,22,24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,22,24-26</a>].</p><p>However, the exact width (thickness) of the negative margin that is optimal for local control is not known. The postoperative assessment of the margin width is difficult once the specimen is removed due to the retraction of the tissues, especially skeletal muscle, when the specimen is passed off the surgical field. It is essential that the surgeon and pathologist work closely together to assess the true margin. Inking of the specimen may help, but the surgeon's assessment of how to orient and mark the specimen adds to the ability of the pathologist to determine a correct statement regarding margin. What may seem like a very wide margin through muscle to the surgeon may look very different to the pathologist when the muscle retracts. There is no perfect way to definitively assess margins, but the optimal result happens when there is direct communication between the surgeon and the pathologist. </p><p>Most clinicians recommend that if surgery is used as the sole modality of treatment, the margin should be at least 1 cm in all directions or include a fascial barrier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. One-centimeter margins seldom occur in reality, especially around neurovascular structures, and it is generally accepted that the type of tissue is important: thinner (1- to 2-mm) margins of fascia are likely adequate, whereas wider margins that consist of fat or muscle are suggested. </p><p>If surgery is combined with RT, the thickness of the surgical margin can be safely reduced without compromising local control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In one study of patients treated with preoperative RT followed by surgery for an extremity STS, local control rates were similar among patients with a negative margin of &le;1 or &gt;1 mm (96 versus 97 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

In the absence of frank bone invasion, resection up to and possibly including the periosteum is an adequate surgical margin for STSs that are treated with wide excision and radiation. Resection of the periosteum should be limited to those cases where the tumor is abutting the periosteum. Periosteal stripping should be avoided unless necessary to achieve a negative margin because it may increase the risk of a later radiation-related pathologic fracture, particularly of the femur, although the evidence to relate fractures to periosteal stripping is weak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. A fracture through irradiated bone does not heal normally and may be quite prolonged.</p><p>Large, deep tumors often do require periosteal stripping to obtain a margin. If radiation will be part of the treatment, some surgeons advocate prophylactic stabilization with a rod or a plate at the time of the resection, particularly when the femur is involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

The incidence of these fractures is fortunately low, but it is highest in the femur and directly related to radiation dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Because of poor fracture healing in irradiated bone, treatment may sometimes be augmented with the use of a vascularized fibular graft to assist in bony union [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3300556807\"><span class=\"h3\">Nerve resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is rarely necessary to resect a major nerve unless the tumor is a neurogenic STS. Surgical resection of the tumor can be accomplished in most patients without sacrificing a major nerve. </p><p>Major nerves can often be preserved if they are carefully resected from the tumor, leaving the nerve sheath as a margin, as it is rare that a nerve is actually invaded by a tumor. But if this is the case, such as with neurogenic tumors arising in the nerve itself, it is necessary to resect the nerve in continuity with the tumor.

With the specimen removed, we usually place vascular clips in the wound to mark the tumor bed for the radiation therapist to guide any necessary postoperative RT. </p><p>Ideally, the specimen will be reviewed by the pathologist and surgeon either in the operating room or the cutting room. The surgeon should point out areas of the resected specimen where the margin is concerning and discuss retraction of muscle from the specimen with the pathologist. If there is a question of a positive margin, additional tissue can be taken at the time of resection for frozen section study (and, later, permanent pathology) to look for residual tumor. Orientation of the additional tissue for the pathologist may be difficult in these situations, but communication with the pathologist regarding the &quot;new&quot; margin is critical.</p><p>If a positive margin is recognized at the time of the resection, further resection should be attempted to obtain final negative margins. Preoperative RT may make close margins more acceptable but can also make intraoperative assessment of margins more difficult because of radiation changes in the surrounding normal but irradiated tissues. </p><p>If a positive margin is detected postoperatively on the final specimen, then the treatment team needs to weigh the pros and cons of re-resection compared with adding more radiation. (see <a href=\"#H2776815620\" class=\"local\">'Inadequate initial resection'</a> below). Sometimes, it is possible to resect more tissue if it is known where the area of concern is, and at other times, this may add too much morbidity.

Formal wound closure is delayed until the surgical margins are certain, and if they are positive, more tissue can be resected before definitive flap closure.

For these cancers, the status of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) reflects the status of the nodal basin with 95 to 97 percent accuracy.</p><p>For STSs, particularly those types with a higher frequency of nodal involvement, it is unknown if earlier identification and treatment of occult nodal metastases using SLNB (followed by completion lymphadenectomy if the SLN is positive) would result in improved survival compared with lymphadenectomy only for clinically evident nodal metastases found by physical examination or radiologic imaging. The role of SLNB in patients with high-risk STS subtypes has been addressed in a few retrospective reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities/abstract/51-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-57</a>].

Only two patients with clear cell sarcoma had additional metastatic nodes after regional dissection, both of whom developed later distant metastases and died of disease. The other four were without evidence of disease on follow-up. One patient with synovial sarcoma and another with epithelioid sarcoma developed regional nodal disease following a negative SLNB, while a further patient with RMS developed distant, local, and regional metastases following a negative SLNB.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another report, 29 patients with a nonmetastatic extremity STS associated with a high rate of nodal metastases (synovial, clear cell, angiosarcoma, RMS, epithelioid sarcoma) underwent SLNB along with resection of the primary tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Among the 20 who had it, the preoperative staging positron emission tomography (PET) scan was interpreted as negative in 16, indeterminate in 3, and suspicious in 1. At least one SLN was found in 28 patients (97 percent). Only one patient (who had a suspicious PET scan) had a positive SLN with micrometastatic disease on pathologic evaluation. He refused completion lymphadenectomy and, despite regional nodal irradiation, developed lung metastases. Two other patients had only immunohistochemical evidence of SLN involvement, and neither relapsed despite not having a completion lymphadenectomy. An additional patient with a negative SLNB later developed a nodal metastasis, and five other patients with a negative SLNB developed distant metastatic disease.</p><p/><p>The results of other smaller series and single-case reports are mixed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities/abstract/52-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-56</a>]. In many but not all cases, patients with positive SLNB have developed distant metastases despite therapeutic lymphadenectomy, and several SLN-negative patients have developed later metastatic disease.</p><p>Taken together, these sparse data suggest that a positive SLNB does not necessarily imply future metastatic disease, nor does the removal of involved nodes by completion lymphadenectomy prevent later distant metastatic spread. Furthermore, a negative SLNB does not imply the absence of disease spread. The rarity of lymph node positivity makes the role of SLNB a difficult question to answer prospectively; this would require proof that patients with a positive SLN have inferior outcomes compared with those with a negative sentinel node in a population of patients, all of whom have had SLNB. Thus, the role of SLNB in this disease, even for histologies with a high rate of nodal spread, remains unclear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2776815620\"><span class=\"h2\">Inadequate initial resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a positive margin is detected postoperatively on the final specimen, the treatment team needs to weigh the pros and cons of re-resection compared with additional radiation. Sometimes, it is possible to resect more tissue if it is known where the area of concern is, and at other times, this may add too much morbidity. It may not be possible to determine exactly where the positive margin is, or it might be near a vital structure, in which case another operation will not be helpful. If the resection has been performed elsewhere prior to referral to the tumor center, it may not be possible to know whether the margins were adequate from the pathology reports or even from the histologic slides since this requires careful analysis. Many times, these are &quot;shell-out&quot; or &quot;oops procedures&quot; where the surgeon thought he or she was excising a benign neoplasm. </p><p>Because local control is still worse with positive as compared with negative margins, it is generally considered prudent to re-resect the tumor bed, but this can be challenging with regard to knowing what to resect and in achieving wound healing. However, it is important to note that only a minority of margin-positive (R1) resections ever result in a local recurrence (approximately 30 percent in most series), whereas not all complete (R0) resections avoid recurrence (5 to 10 percent in most series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities/abstract/58-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-62</a>]. Re-resection to negative margins is performed in conjunction with RT given either before or after re-resection. Approximately 37 to 68 percent of such patients will have residual tumor in the re-resection specimen. </p><p>Re-excision must take into account the size of the re-excised field and the potential for damage or exposure of critical neurovascular structures necessitating reconstructive surgical procedures. In major sarcoma centers, positive margins in patients with extremity lesions usually reflect tumor on the neurovascular bundle, and further surgery to achieve negative margins would usually entail an amputation; most patients in this setting are treated with higher doses of adjuvant RT (in the range of 66 to 68 Gy), with amputation reserved for salvage.</p><p>Partial excision of the tumor before referral to a tertiary center also does not appear to compromise limb preservation, local control, or, in most series, survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities/abstract/58,62-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,62-65</a>].

These data underscore the importance of transferring patients with soft tissue masses of uncertain diagnosis to centers that specialize in treating sarcomas so that they can undergo adequate initial resection.</p><p>Some patients are not candidates for re-resection because of either a medical contraindication or the desire to preserve extremity function. The use of RT as an alternative to re-resection can help secure local control in a substantial proportion of these patients, although there may be dose limitations because of prior radiation to the site. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2833327082\"><span class=\"h2\">Brachytherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brachytherapy is a well-established modality for treatment, but it may extend hospitalization and may not be covered by insurance.

A plastic surgeon is an essential part of this team. Discussion preoperatively about the resection plan, including how much skin and other soft tissue will be removed, and an estimation of the resulting &quot;dead space&quot; and the quality of the remaining soft tissues, especially in older adult patients who have had radiation, will affect the decision for the use or not of rotational or free flaps.

A thumb amputation is more devastating from a functional point of view, but a pollicization of the index finger or a toe-to-thumb free tissue transfer can be used depending on the location of the tumor. Other amputation levels, depending on the location of the tumor and prior treatments such as radiation therapy, include below- and above-elbow amputation, shoulder disarticulation, and, on rare occasions, forequarter amputation.

In one study of bone and soft tissue neoplasms, the detected incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was 4 percent and of pulmonary embolism was 1.2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. Fatal pulmonary embolism occurred in 0.4 percent in this study of 94 bone sarcomas and 158 STSs. It should be noted that not all patients (70 percent) received DVT prophylaxis. Unless the risk of hematoma or bleeding is high, it is reasonable to use thromboprophylaxis postoperatively, especially in lower-extremity STS resections.

Following radiation and resection for lower-extremity sarcomas, patients often require physical therapy and compressive stockings postoperatively to help control edema, particularly if there was extensive dissection involving lymphatics or veins. This is permanent in some patients but can often be controlled with stockings and other lymphedema treatment techniques. Many centers have specialized clinics to deal with these issues.

Following intracompartmental resection, local failure rates are between 10 and 20 percent. </p><p>While it is well documented that the risk of a local recurrence is higher for high-grade tumors, it is not uniformly low for low-grade tumors. In one of the randomized trials, the improvement in local control in irradiated patients appeared to be limited to patients with high-grade histopathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>], but, in the other, there was a significant reduction in risk for low-grade tumors as well (5 versus 30 percent local recurrence rate for patients treated with surgery alone) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. </p><p>A postoperative nomogram, which was based upon data from 684 patients with an extremity sarcoma treated with limb-sparing surgery alone at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center over a 24-year period, was proposed for predicting local recurrence rates at three and five years after limb-sparing surgery without radiation therapy (RT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. The nomogram includes five independent predictors of recurrence: age, size, margin status, grade, and histology. While this nomogram may be a useful tool to estimate the risk of a local recurrence in an individual patient, the appropriate cutoff point for deciding that the risk justifies the addition of RT is unclear.

In the 1970s, up to one-half of patients with extremity STS underwent primary amputation, whereas in contemporary series, the rate of amputation has been reduced to approximately 1 percent (without any measurable fall in overall survival) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities/abstract/7,17,18,58,93,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,17,18,58,93,94</a>].

They can arise from mesenchymal tissue at any body site. (See <a href=\"#H1492677891\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical resection of the primary tumor is the essential component of treatment for virtually all patients. The guiding principle is total resection of the primary tumor with a margin of normal tissue surrounding the tumor and avoidance of cutting into tumor tissue during the resection. (See <a href=\"#H1740909505\" class=\"local\">'Wide local excision'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with STS, surgical excision, typically in conjunction with adjunctive medical therapy, is recommended. What constitutes an &quot;adequate&quot; margin is not well defined and probably depends on the type of tissue. (See <a href=\"#H76873764\" class=\"local\">'Resection margins'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain histologies (synovial sarcoma, the vascular sarcomas, rhabdomyosarcomas [RMSs], and the epithelioid and clear cell subtypes) have a higher risk of nodal metastases than do other types of adult STS (11 to 44 percent versus 5 percent). However, we do not routinely perform lymphadenectomy, even with these histologies. Regardless of the histologic tumor type, regional lymph node dissection is recommended only if there is clinical or radiologic evidence of regional nodal disease. The role of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), even in patients with high-risk subtypes, is unclear. (See <a href=\"#H1749616028\" class=\"local\">'Lymphadenectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with an incompletely resected primary STS, re-resection is preferred, if possible. For patients who are not candidates for re-resection, either because of a medical contraindication or the desire to preserve extremity function, adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) can secure local control in a substantial proportion. (See <a href=\"#H2776815620\" class=\"local\">'Inadequate initial resection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The combination of RT plus surgery achieves better local control than either modality alone for the majority of STSs for which adjuvant therapy is indicated. The use of adjuvant radiation lessens the necessity for primary amputation or radical resection, and it results in reasonable functional outcomes and acceptable cancer outcomes without the significant morbidity and cosmetic deformity of radical surgery or amputation. Neoadjuvant RT is generally preferred over postoperative RT for most patients because of significantly lower rates of late treatment-related toxicity. However, surgical resections are more challenging in a previously irradiated field, and wound healing is challenging in this setting. (See <a href=\"#H844287515\" class=\"local\">'Adjunctive medical therapies'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neoadjuvant therapy is most often considered in the setting of a large or recurrent high-grade tumor, particularly if limb salvage is an issue. In these situations, RT is most commonly selected with or without chemotherapy. The optimal neoadjuvant regimen and how best to integrate radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and surgery are unknown. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-multimodality-treatment-for-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities-and-chest-wall#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of multimodality treatment for primary soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities and chest wall&quot;, section on 'Initial chemoradiotherapy for large high-grade STS'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, for patients with large, locally advanced, or recurrent extremity STS, neoadjuvant chemotherapy can be administered systemically in conjunction with regional hyperthermia or regionally (intra-arterially) using procedures such as isolated limb infusion and isolated limb perfusion. These treatments are rarely used in the United States, but, where available, they represent potentially limb-preserving options. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-locally-recurrent-and-unresectable-locally-advanced-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of locally recurrent and unresectable, locally advanced soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities&quot;, section on 'Regional chemotherapy'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following treatment, for patients with stage II or III disease, we suggest history, physical examination, and chest imaging every three to six months for two to three years, then every six months for the next two years, then annually. Following treatment of stage I disease, we suggest a history and physical examination at three- to six-month intervals for the first two years, and yearly thereafter. Periodic imaging of the primary site is also indicated in high-risk patients. For patients at higher risk of local recurrence, such as those with positive margins or whose primary tumor site is not easily examined, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is preferred over computed tomography (CT) scanning.
