It is a heterogenous condition characterized by multiple possible seizure types and syndromes, diverse etiologies, and variable prognoses. Accurate classification is essential for several reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ilae-classification-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To provide a framework for understanding the type(s) of seizure(s) a patient has, other types that are more likely to occur, potential seizure triggers, and prognosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To inform the risk of comorbidities (eg, psychiatric, cognitive) and mortality, including sudden unexpected death in epilepsy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To guide choice of optimal antiseizure drug and surgical therapies</p><p/><p>Over the past several decades, significant advances in neuroimaging, genomic technologies, and molecular biology have improved the understanding of the pathogenesis of seizures and epilepsy. In addition, additional epilepsy syndromes have been delineated. As a result, existing International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification systems for seizures and epilepsies have become outdated and inadequate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ilae-classification-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. </p><p>The ILAE Commission on Classification and Terminology proposed substantial changes to the 1989 classification system in 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ilae-classification-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] and made further revisions in 2017 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ilae-classification-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/2,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,7</a>]. The current framework allows for diagnosis at four levels, depending on information and resources that are available, and also addresses the broad concepts of etiology and associated comorbidities at all levels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F112425\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112425 \">figure 1</a>). In resource-poor settings with limited access to electroencephalography (EEG), neuroimaging, or specialized genetic and metabolic studies, or in situations in which limited history is present, the maximal level of diagnosis may be limited to seizure type only (level 1). Conversely, higher levels of diagnosis will likely be possible with more detailed history and greater availability of testing.</p><p>The most important concepts developed in the latest ILAE proposal are described here. The evaluation and diagnosis of seizures and epilepsy in children and adults are discussed separately.

Of note, the terms simple partial, complex partial, and secondarily generalized have been eliminated, since they were difficult to define pragmatically and were often used incorrectly.</p><p>Generalized seizures are further broken down into motor and nonmotor (absence) seizures. Focal seizures are further subdivided based on level of awareness (aware, impaired awareness, or unknown awareness). Additionally, focal seizures are subgrouped into motor and nonmotor seizures, based on signs and symptoms at onset. Additional descriptors for both generalized and focal seizures may be added based on specific motor or nonmotor symptoms. Focal seizures can also be more clearly described based on their elemental features (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F94645\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94645 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>The term &quot;focal to bilateral tonic clonic&quot; is used to describe a seizure that begins focally but then spreads to engage bilateral networks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2812505836\"><span class=\"h1\">LEVEL 2: EPILEPSY BASED ON SEIZURE TYPE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The 1989 classification categorized epilepsies as either focal or generalized. The 2017 classification retains these terms, but acknowledges that not all epilepsies can be dichotomized into these two categories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ilae-classification-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/2,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,7</a>]. Thus, two additional categories have been added: generalized and focal epilepsy and unknown if generalized or focal epilepsy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1882822503\"><span class=\"h2\">Generalized epilepsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epilepsy is considered generalized if the seizures originate at some point within, or rapidly engage bilaterally distributed networks, which can be subcortical or cortical structures and are frequently both. Generalized seizures do not need to necessarily include the entire cortex, however, and they may be asymmetric. Individuals with generalized epilepsy typically show generalized spike-wave or generalized paroxysmal fast activity on electroencephalogram (EEG). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=electroencephalography-eeg-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Electroencephalography (EEG) in the diagnosis of seizures and epilepsy&quot;, section on 'EEG findings in patients with epilepsy'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1145270672\"><span class=\"h2\">Focal epilepsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term focal has replaced partial to describe epilepsy associated with seizures that are inferred from clinical or EEG data to originate in networks limited to one hemisphere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ilae-classification-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/2,5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5-7</a>]. Focal seizures may arise from either subcortical structures or neocortex.

This category includes several epilepsy syndromes, particularly those with onset in early childhood, such as Dravet syndrome or Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, but may also be relevant for epilepsies associated with diffuse or focal structural, genetic, or metabolic etiologies. The interictal EEG may show both generalized and <span class=\"nowrap\">focal/multifocal</span> discharges, or epileptiform discharges may be absent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dravet-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dravet syndrome: Genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epilepsy-syndromes-in-children#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epilepsy syndromes in children&quot;, section on 'Lennox-Gastaut syndrome'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3905628168\"><span class=\"h2\">Unknown if generalized or focal epilepsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This term is used for epilepsies with seizures in which it cannot be clearly determined whether onset is focal or generalized. A key example is epileptic spasms, which may appear generalized despite being caused by a focal lesion. The term unknown should also be used in an individual who presents with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure and normal examination but whose EEG and neuroimaging is either noninformative or unavailable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3111074435\"><span class=\"h1\">LEVEL 3: EPILEPSY SYNDROME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An epilepsy syndrome represents a complex of clinical features, signs and symptoms that together define a distinctive, recognizable clinical seizure disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ilae-classification-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/2,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,7</a>]. Some syndromes are highly correlated with a single specific etiology (eg, <em>SCN1A</em> mutations in Dravet syndrome), whereas others may be due to a broad range of causes (eg, West syndrome or Lennox-Gastaut syndrome).</p><p>Many syndromes can be identified based on age at onset, seizure type(s), electroencephalogram (EEG) characteristics, etiology, and associated comorbidities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F91410\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91410 \">table 3</a>).

Familial focal epilepsy with variable foci and reflex epilepsies have a less specific relationship with age of onset.

Advances in neuroimaging and genetics, as well as improved understanding of the role of specific autoantibodies, have allowed greater accuracy in diagnosis for many people with epilepsy. Although patients may share a unifying etiologic diagnosis, phenotypic variability may still be marked, likely reflecting modifier genes and environmental factors.</p><p>Of note, not all patients who can be classified at Level 4 with a specific etiologic diagnosis will have an identifiable epilepsy syndrome. Thus, classification can be made at Level 4, but not at Level 3, in some individuals. In addition, a consistent correlation between a specific etiology and epilepsy syndrome is lacking. For example, <em>SCN1A</em> mutations may be associated with milder phenotypes, such as genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) or more severe phenotypes such as Dravet syndrome. Similarly, tuberous sclerosis complex may result in a broad range of severities of epilepsy.

The 2017 ILAE classification recognizes six etiologic categories: genetic, structural, metabolic, immune, infectious, and unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ilae-classification-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/2,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,7</a>]. The terms idiopathic, symptomatic, and cryptogenic were eliminated as of the 2010 revision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ilae-classification-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Etiology of epilepsy should be considered at all four levels of diagnosis.</p><p>Some etiologies are best described by a combination of categories. For example, tuberous sclerosis would be described as a genetic-structural etiology, and Leigh syndrome as a genetic-metabolic etiology.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1145270640\"><span class=\"h3\">Genetic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A genetic etiology is defined when epilepsy is the direct result of a known or presumed genetic defect and seizures are the core symptom of the disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ilae-classification-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A genetic etiology is most frequently based on family aggregation and twin studies; only a minority of patients have a known genetic mutation, but this is changing rapidly with advances in molecular technologies. </p><p>This category includes the epilepsy syndromes of the generalized genetic epilepsies (previously referred to as idiopathic generalized epilepsies), such as childhood absence epilepsy, juvenile absence epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and epilepsy with tonic-clonic seizures alone, in which there is strong evidence from both family and twin studies of a heritable etiology. In these syndromes, cognition is usually normal and seizure control is most often favorable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=childhood-absence-epilepsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Childhood absence epilepsy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Other genetic causes may be associated with intellectual disability and poor prognosis for seizure control, including Dravet syndrome, <em>PCDH19</em>-related epilepsy, and Down syndrome.

Structural etiologies may be congenital (eg, cortical dysplasia, tuberous sclerosis) or acquired (eg, stroke, trauma, infection, immune-based). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1525979778\"><span class=\"h3\">Metabolic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A metabolic etiology is defined when a patient has a documented metabolic condition that is associated with a substantially increased risk of developing epilepsy. Examples include glucose transporter deficiency, creatine deficiency syndromes, and mitochondrial cytopathies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3643609049\"><span class=\"h3\">Immune</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Distinct immune mediated etiologies are defined as those in which there is evidence of central nervous system inflammation that results in epilepsy. Examples of immune etiologies include Rasmussen encephalitis, anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paraneoplastic and autoimmune encephalitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2766178262\"><span class=\"h3\">Infectious</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Central nervous system infection may result in both acute symptomatic seizures as well as epilepsy. Infections are one of the most important causes of epilepsy worldwide. Examples of infectious etiologies of epilepsy include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), neurocysticercosis, malaria, and tuberculosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1145270659\"><span class=\"h3\">Unknown</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term unknown has replaced the term cryptogenic, and simply means that the nature of the underlying cause is not currently known. All types of epilepsies with normal imaging and no documented genetic, metabolic, immune or infectious etiology are included in this category.</p><p>This category should also be used for disorders previously classified as idiopathic focal epilepsy, including benign epilepsy of childhood with centrotemporal spikes and Panayiotopoulos syndrome; in such disorders, there may be some genetic contribution to the epilepsy, but current evidence does not suggest that genetic factors are paramount. Generalized epilepsies that do not fit into one of the generalized genetic epilepsy syndromes, and for which there is insufficient evidence to support a heritable cause, should also be classified as unknown.</p><p>Epilepsies of unknown cause are common, accounting for approximately one-third of all cases. In this heterogeneous group of disorders, it is particularly important to collect further information on other relevant features, including cognitive and developmental antecedents and consequences, abnormalities on neurological examination, EEG features, provoking or triggering factors, natural history, age at onset, and other features.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3184762245\"><span class=\"h2\">Comorbidities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All epilepsies, at any level of the diagnostic framework, can have associated cognitive, psychological, and behavioral comorbidities, which may impact quality of life even more profoundly than the seizures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=comorbidities-and-complications-of-epilepsy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Comorbidities and complications of epilepsy in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-initial-treatment-and-monitoring#H1539285619\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seizures and epilepsy in children: Initial treatment and monitoring&quot;, section on 'Psychiatric and behavioral health screening'</a>.)</p><p>Identification of specific etiologies and syndromes may assist in prediction of type and severity of comorbidity. As an example, West syndrome predicts significantly greater risk of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder, and girls with <em>PCDH19</em> mutations are also at high risk of behavioral problems and autism spectrum disorder.

This means that ongoing epileptic activity adversely impacts cognition and behavior, above and beyond what can be ascribed to the underlying etiology, if one is present (eg, cortical dysplasia).</p><p>Inherent to this concept is that amelioration of epileptiform activity has the potential to improve the developmental consequences of the disorder. However, many etiologies for epileptic encephalopathies also result in cognitive slowing and regression, independent of epilepsy, and it can be challenging to determine the degree to which developmental impact is caused by frequent seizures and epileptiform discharges versus the underlying etiology.</p><p>The 2017 proposal suggests broadening of this terminology to include both developmental <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> epileptic encephalopathy, to emphasize that both the underlying etiology and the epileptic process may independently impact development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ilae-classification-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/2,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,7</a>]. Acceptable terms include epileptic encephalopathy, developmental encephalopathy, or developmental epileptic encephalopathy. The term &quot;gene name&quot; encephalopathy (eg, <em>KCNQ2</em> encephalopathy) can be used when a genetic mutation of major effect is identified. </p><p>The terms benign, malignant, and catastrophic have been used in the past to describe the natural history of epilepsy. The 2010 proposal suggested replacing the term benign with more descriptive terms, such as self-limited (for epilepsies in which spontaneous remission is likely) and pharmacoresponsive (for those in which there is high likelihood of rapid control with medication) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ilae-classification-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification system is widely used and has been updated most recently in 2010 and 2017, with several key changes from prior versions. (See <a href=\"#H26939127\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of seizure requires that the clinician identify that the patient has had an epileptic seizure as opposed to some other type of paroxysmal event, and then establish the type of seizure(s) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F91409\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91409 \">table 1</a>). The four major seizure types are generalized, focal, unknown, and unclassified.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epilepsies can be subdivided into generalized, focal, generalized and focal, and unknown (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F112425\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112425 \">figure 1</a>). The latter includes epileptic spasms, for which current knowledge is inadequate to determine whether onset is focal or generalized. (See <a href=\"#H2812505836\" class=\"local\">'Level 2: Epilepsy based on seizure type'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An epilepsy syndrome represents a distinct clinical entity, defined as a complex of clinical features, signs and symptoms that together define a distinctive, recognizable clinical disorder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F91410\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91410 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3111074435\" class=\"local\">'Level 3: Epilepsy syndrome'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The 2017 ILAE classification recognizes six etiologic categories: genetic, structural, metabolic, immune, infectious, and unknown. (See <a href=\"#H1936315850\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ilae-classification-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Fisher RS, Acevedo C, Arzimanoglou A, et al.
