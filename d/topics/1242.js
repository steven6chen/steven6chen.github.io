In the United States, there are an estimated 14 million cancer survivors as of 2014, a figure that is expected to increase to approximately 18 million in the next 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-following-treatment-for-breast-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Over three million women have a history of breast cancer, which constitutes 41 percent of the population of female cancer survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-following-treatment-for-breast-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Although the vast majority of breast cancer survivors are women, approximately 2500 men are diagnosed with breast cancer annually in the United States alone, and most will achieve long-term disease-free survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-following-treatment-for-breast-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-cancer-in-men\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast cancer in men&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients who are living for decades beyond cancer experience the normal issues of aging, which are often compounded by the long-term effects of having had cancer and cancer therapy. These patients are at risk for a breast cancer recurrence (which is most common in the first five years but may occur even decades following treatment), a new primary breast cancer, other cancers, and short-term and long-term adverse effects of treatment. Additional issues for cancer survivors relate to psychological, genetic, reproductive, social, and employment concerns. </p><p>Unfortunately, there is a lack of clear evidence for what constitutes best practices in caring for patients with a history of cancer, and this contributes to wide variation in care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-following-treatment-for-breast-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Recommendations for post-treatment surveillance after primary therapy of breast cancer will be reviewed here. Detailed discussions of prognosis, the patterns of relapse (ie, locoregional recurrence, second primary breast tumor, metastatic disease), and long-term complications of breast cancer therapy are presented separately.

We define a cancer survivor as any person with cancer, starting from the moment of diagnosis. This is consistent with definitions from the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-following-treatment-for-breast-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] and the National Cancer Institute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-following-treatment-for-breast-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>This overview addresses breast cancer survivors who have completed initial treatment for breast cancer (ie, surgery, chemotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation therapy) and who are without evidence of disease. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H346411030\"><span class=\"h1\">GUIDELINES FOR POST-TREATMENT FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Guidelines from American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) suggest that patients with early stage breast cancer (tumor &lt;5 cm and fewer than four positive nodes) may follow up exclusively with a primary care provider (PCP); for patients and clinicians who agree with this plan, care may be transferred approximately one year after diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-following-treatment-for-breast-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In such cases, both the patient and the PCP should be advised of the appropriate follow-up and management strategy. </p><p>Additional guidelines for post-treatment follow-up were made by the Institute of Medicine; these are discussed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cancer-survivorship-care-for-primary-care-and-oncology-providers#H418030573\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cancer survivorship care for primary care and oncology providers&quot;, section on 'Guidelines for posttreatment follow-up'</a>). </p><p>Prognosis of non-metastatic breast cancer is discussed elsewhere.

Furthermore, input from an oncology specialist is warranted if there is suspicion or evidence of disease recurrence, or if questions arise regarding the safety of certain interventions (eg, vaginal estrogen in a patient who has severe atrophic vaginitis). </p><p>Breast cancer survivors should receive ongoing age-appropriate screening studies and preventive care, consistent with recommendations for the general population, for conditions other than those related to breast cancer and its treatment.

We suggest that patients be seen every three to six months during the first three years after primary therapy, every 6 to 12 months for the next two years, and then annually (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F61501\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61501 \">table 1</a>), consistent with American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2015 guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-following-treatment-for-breast-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, this schedule is arbitrary; no studies have evaluated the benefit of less frequent clinical visits in patients with low-risk disease or more frequent visits in those with higher-risk disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-following-treatment-for-breast-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H541711675\"><span class=\"h3\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the general components of a medical history, the breast cancer survivor should be screened for symptoms of local recurrence as well as metastatic disease. Any changes in the family history should be obtained, which may be important to discussions regarding genetic counseling. (See <a href=\"#H346411104\" class=\"local\">'Genetic counseling'</a> below.) </p><p>The history should include any interval changes in the patient&rsquo;s social environment (including partner status, life events, living arrangements, and occupational issues) that may have arisen since the end of treatment. </p><p>A review of systems should not only screen for metastatic disease but also may identify issues related to prior treatment.

This is particularly important in women who are receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> because of the increased risk for endometrial tumors.

This was illustrated best in a 2008 case-control study that compared mammographic utilization in women over 65 years who died or did not die of breast cancer and who lived at least 30 months following breast cancer diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-following-treatment-for-breast-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Women who had undergone a surveillance mammogram within one year were less likely to die of breast cancer (odds ratio [OR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.72-0.95). &#160; </p><p>The purpose of post-treatment mammographic surveillance is to detect ipsilateral local recurrences after breast conserving therapy (BCT), which develops in up to four percent of women treated for early breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-following-treatment-for-breast-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In addition, mammography is performed as surveillance for a contralateral breast cancer. There is a lack of high-quality evidence to inform the optimal timing and survival benefit of mammographic surveillance for detecting ipsilateral recurrence or a contralateral breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-following-treatment-for-breast-cancer/abstract/16,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,20</a>]. For women in long-term follow-up, mammographic surveillance should be obtained annually.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H469430935\"><span class=\"h4\">Local recurrence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no prospective trials that address the utility of mammography in the detection of local recurrence. Data from retrospective series suggest that mammography detects earlier lesions with a more favorable prognosis and that survival is improved in women whose lesions are detected mammographically as compared with those detected by other means [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-following-treatment-for-breast-cancer/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. However, other data suggest that mammographic screening in women with a personal history of breast cancer performs less well (lower sensitivity and slightly lower specificity) than in women without such a history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-following-treatment-for-breast-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In one study, women with a personal history of breast cancer had a higher rate of interval cancers compared with women without a history of breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-following-treatment-for-breast-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Fortunately, the majority of both screen-detected and interval cancers were early stage.

However, recommendations for mammographic surveillance are based upon the benefits seen in the general population without a history of breast cancer. In general, breast cancer survivors are higher-risk women than the general population, and it would seem reasonable to infer that they derive as much or even more benefit from mammography of the contralateral breast. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for breast cancer: Strategies and recommendations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is indirect evidence from retrospective series that supports a beneficial impact for mammography of the contralateral breast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-following-treatment-for-breast-cancer/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. One study compared outcomes among a cohort of breast cancer survivors in which both physical examination and mammography were performed for post-treatment follow-up versus a separate cohort of women who were followed only by physical examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-following-treatment-for-breast-cancer/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Although the frequency of contralateral breast cancer was similar in both groups, more recurrences were node-negative in the women with utilization of routine mammography (75 versus 57 percent, respectively). Furthermore, the contralateral tumors were more often smaller than 10 mm or in situ (noninvasive) (35 versus 7 percent, respectively). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12559900\"><span class=\"h3\">Breast MRI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not routinely recommended for breast cancer survivors because of a lack of evidence to inform its role in this population. This was demonstrated in a 2012 systematic review that included 10 case series (n = 494) on the role of MRI in the detection of a recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-following-treatment-for-breast-cancer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The sensitivity and specificity of MRI to detect recurrent breast cancer was no better than for mammography historically. However, breast MRI can be useful for patients suspected of a breast cancer recurrence when mammography (with or without breast ultrasound) is inconclusive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-following-treatment-for-breast-cancer/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Breast MRI is indicated in the follow-up of women at high risk for recurrent disease based on a known BRCA-mutation or strongly positive family history. However, this practice is extrapolated from the indications for breast MRI as a screening tool in high risk women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-patients-at-high-risk-for-breast-and-ovarian-cancer#H373713648\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of patients at high risk for breast and ovarian cancer&quot;, section on 'Breast magnetic resonance imaging'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H463691260\"><span class=\"h3\">Ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine use of breast ultrasound as part of surveillance is not recommended. The addition of breast ultrasound (US) to screening mammography was evaluated in a trial in which 2809 women with an elevated risk for breast cancer who were undergoing routine screening mammography were randomly assigned to mammography alone or with breast US [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-following-treatment-for-breast-cancer/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Compared with mammography alone, ultrasound plus mammography increased the diagnostic yield (from 8 to 12 per 1000 women, 95% CI 1.1-7.2) but also increased the rate of false positive results (4.4 versus 10.4 percent) and therefore lowered the positive predictive value. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H469431146\"><span class=\"h3\">Surveillance of reconstructed breasts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women who have undergone mastectomy, surveillance is usually performed by physical examination. Routine mammographic imaging is technically limited in patients who have prosthetic implants and is generally not advocated. However, mammography is technically feasible following autogenous myocutaneous flap reconstruction, particularly following TRAM (transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous) or perforator flap reconstruction, because abdominal adipose tissue forms the bulk of the reconstructed breast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-following-treatment-for-breast-cancer/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Although the available data are sparse, and there is no consensus on this issue, some institutions image TRAM-reconstructed breasts using mammography since even after mastectomy, some normal tissue may be left on the chest wall from which a new breast cancer may on occasion arise. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-breast-reconstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of breast reconstruction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-mastectomy#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of locoregional recurrence of breast cancer after mastectomy&quot;, section on 'Findings on imaging'</a>.)</p><p>The only place where cancer can occur is either right below the skin in the subcutaneous tissue or just over the pectoralis muscle. Physical examination remains the cornerstone of detection of recurrent breast cancer after reconstruction, and other modalities such as MRI should be used only as adjuncts to clarify any physical findings.

This was demonstrated in a 2011 meta-analysis of 14 case-control studies that evaluated the impact of pregnancy on the overall survival of women with breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-following-treatment-for-breast-cancer/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. Compared with women who did not get pregnant, those who became pregnant had a 40 percent reduction in the risk of death (pooled risk ratio [PRR] 0.59, 90% CI 0.50-0.70). This outcome is likely explained by a selection bias known as the &ldquo;healthy mother effect&rdquo;, such that only healthy breast cancer survivors were able to conceive and carry a pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-following-treatment-for-breast-cancer/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].

Clinicians should discuss the use of a nonhormonal contraceptive method (condom, diaphragm, copper IUD) and help the woman choose the method most consistent with her lifestyle and beliefs.</p><p>While women with a history of breast cancer may wish to preserve fertility, they may not have an imminent desire to become pregnant. Potential options for contraception include barrier methods (eg, diaphragms, condoms) and the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=copper-intrauterine-device-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">copper intrauterine device</a> (IUD). A more extensive discussion of the topic of contraception is covered separately.

The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine contraception device (LNG-IUD) has been evaluated in women with a history of breast cancer, although primarily as a method of endometrial protection from the effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> rather than as a contraceptive modality. Data are limited and inconclusive, but suggest an increased risk of cancer recurrence despite a low rate of systemic hormone absorption. This was shown in one retrospective cohort study of breast cancer survivors that evaluated the risk of cancer recurrence among cases (LNG-IUD users, n = 79) and controls (those who did not use LNG-IUD, n = 120) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-following-treatment-for-breast-cancer/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. The rate of breast cancer recurrence was higher in cases compared with matched controls (22 versus 17 percent, OR 1.86, 95% CI 0.86-4.00), although the difference was not statistically significant. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-the-side-effects-of-tamoxifen#H9482672\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Managing the side effects of tamoxifen&quot;, section on 'Endometrial protection'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H604338985\"><span class=\"h1\">QUALITY OF LIFE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Quality of life is a multidimensional construct that takes into account the physical, mental, social, economic, and spiritual aspects of life.

However, they may continue to have some lingering concerns. For example, in one study that included over 280 long-term survivors (without evidence of a recurrence &gt;7 years) compared with almost 170 controls (without a history of breast cancer), self-reported deficits appeared to be limited to issues related to cognitive functioning and finances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-following-treatment-for-breast-cancer/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].</p><p>Multiple studies have shown that exercise improves quality of life in breast cancer survivors. Therefore, patients should be encouraged to adopt a physically active lifestyle following treatment for breast cancer.

Clinicians should be experienced in the surveillance of these patients, the complications that may arise from treatment, and in breast examination, including the examination of irradiated breasts. A shared care model that integrates both specialists and primary care providers on ongoing follow-up care may provide the best adherence to guidelines for recommended care; but communication and coordination of care is required.
