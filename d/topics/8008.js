Children with hearing loss frequently appear to be normal. Hearing loss that is undetected and untreated can result in speech, language, and cognitive delays. Early identification and effective treatment of hearing loss improve language, communication, and cognitive skills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-impairment-in-children-evaluation/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p>The evaluation of hearing impairment in children is reviewed here. The etiology and treatment of hearing loss in children are discussed separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53903\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53903 \">table 1</a>). Newborn hearing screening is also covered in detail separately.

Infants with hearing loss should be evaluated by an otolaryngologist who is knowledgeable in pediatric hearing loss and should have at least one examination to assess visual acuity by an ophthalmologist who is experienced in evaluating infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-impairment-in-children-evaluation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In a series of 226 children with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), the prevalence of ophthalmologic abnormalities was 22 percent (compared with approximately 14 percent in the general population) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-impairment-in-children-evaluation/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].

As examples, a white forelock and heterochromia of the iris are seen in Waardenburg syndrome, micrognathia in Apert syndrome and Robin sequence, and enlarged thyroid in Pendred syndrome. Examination of the head and neck is especially important. In a retrospective analysis of 114 children with hearing loss referred to a tertiary care center, 43 percent had head and neck abnormalities that helped to establish the etiology of hearing loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-impairment-in-children-evaluation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

The external auditory canal should be cleared of cerumen for more accurate hearing testing. The tympanic membrane should be viewed to ensure that no middle ear abnormality (eg, middle ear fluid, tympanic membrane perforation, tympanic membrane scarring, cholesteatoma or other middle ear mass) exists. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-anomalies-of-the-ear\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital anomalies of the ear&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-pediatric-physical-examination-heent#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The pediatric physical examination: HEENT&quot;, section on 'Ears'</a>.)</p><p>Pneumatic otoscopy is performed with positive and negative pressure to evaluate mobility of the tympanic membrane. Diminished or absent tympanic membrane mobility can be caused by fluid, mass in the middle ear cavity, perforation, pressure equalization tube, or sclerosis of the tympanic membrane. Increased mobility of the tympanic membrane can indicate ossicular chain disruption.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Office hearing tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In older children and adolescents, hearing status can be assessed in the office using 256 Hz and 512 Hz tuning forks. Hearing loss at 256 Hz is equivalent to approximately 10 to 15 decibels (dB) and hearing loss at 512 Hz is equivalent to 20 to 30 dB. An ear with normal hearing has air conduction (sound waves traveling to the tympanic membrane and converted into sound in the inner ear) that is louder than bone conduction (sound transmitted via the vibration of the skull into the cochlea). The Weber and Rinne tests examine the relative adequacy of air and bone conduction of sound (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58032\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58032 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74488\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74488 \">table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Weber test is performed by placing the tuning fork on the bridge of the forehead, nose, or teeth and asking the child if the sound is louder in one ear or the other. The sound is heard equally in both ears in children with normal hearing. Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is suspected if the vibratory sound is louder on the &quot;good&quot; side. Conductive hearing loss is suspected if the vibratory sound is louder on the &quot;bad&quot; side.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Rinne test compares bone conduction (when the tuning fork is placed on the mastoid bone) with air conduction (when the tuning fork is held near the ear). The test is negative when bone conduction is greater than air conduction. A negative test is consistent with conductive hearing loss, especially if the Weber test also lateralizes to that side. The Rinne test is positive (or normal) when air conduction is greater than bone conduction. SNHL is suspected when the Weber test lateralizes to an ear in which the Rinne test was positive and the Rinne test in the opposite ear is also positive.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As examples, a conductive hearing loss on the right side would demonstrate a Weber test that lateralizes to the right (ipsilateral side), a Rinne test which is negative (bone conduction greater than air conduction) on the right, and a Rinne test which is normal (positive) on the left. A SNHL on the right side would demonstrate a Weber test that lateralizes to the left (contralateral side), and normal (positive) Rinne tests bilaterally. Testing results may vary for mixed hearing loss, severe SNHL (Rinne test on the bad ear will appear to be negative because bone conduction crosses over and is detected by the good ear), or conductive hearing loss below the thresholds that are detectable by the tuning forks used.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">OFFICE AUDIOLOGY SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Objective audiologic screening is recommended for all newborns and periodically for children between 4 and 11 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-impairment-in-children-evaluation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Pure tone audiometry, tympanometry, or otoacoustic emission (OAE) testing may be performed by the primary care provider. Pure tone audiometry and OAE may be performed in a quiet room rather than an expensive soundproof environment, but may fail to detect mild hearing losses (&lt;30 decibels [dB]). Any patient with abnormal office audiometry should be referred for formal audiology testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-impairment-in-children-evaluation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The schedule and indications for hearing screening are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-tests-in-children-and-adolescents#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening tests in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Hearing screen'</a>.)</p><p>Pure tone audiometry in the office involves determining the softest decibel threshold at which the child can hear a sound 50 percent of the time for each tested frequency. This is plotted on a graph showing hearing threshold (dB) as a function of frequency (Hz), with louder thresholds marked lower on the graph. Normal hearing threshold is between 0 to 20 dB. Often only air thresholds are tested in the office setting. Accurate results are dependent upon cooperation from the child. Any threshold &gt;20 dB suggests a hearing loss (conductive, sensorineural, or mixed). Conductive hearing loss is suggested in the setting of fluid in the middle ear or a flat tympanogram.</p><p>OAE testing is another pediatric hearing screening test. This test measures the presence and strength of low-intensity sound (OAE) produced by the cochlea in response to an acoustic stimulus. Testing does not require a behavioral response from the child; however, a quiet setting is still needed. An abnormal OAE may be due to cochlear dysfunction or conductive hearing loss.</p><p>Tympanometry can be used as a screening tool for otitis media with effusion (OME) that is often associated with conductive hearing loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-impairment-in-children-evaluation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Tympanometry is most valuable in conjunction with pneumatic otoscopy. Flat tympanograms (type B tympanograms) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67750\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67750 \">figure 2</a>) are usually due to middle ear effusion (acute otitis media or otitis media with effusion [also known as serous otitis media or middle ear effusion]). A hearing evaluation and referral to an otolaryngologist may be warranted if the abnormalities fail to resolve with appropriate therapy (for acute otitis media) or during the expected time frame (for otitis media with effusion). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-management#H170941090\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Otitis media with effusion (serous otitis media) in children: Management&quot;, section on 'Approach to management'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-otitis-media-in-children-treatment#H49926213\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute otitis media in children: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Follow-up'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">FORMAL AUDIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Formal audiologic assessment is performed by an audiologist in a soundproof environment and provides detailed information about hearing ability. Every audiologic work-up consists of numerous studies. The age of the child, the reason for the referral, the test environment, the equipment available, and the skill of the test administrator determine which tests will be performed. No child is too young to have his or her hearing evaluated. Children who have abnormal formal audiology results should be referred to otolaryngology, speech-language pathology, genetics, and early intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-impairment-in-children-evaluation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Pure tone audiometry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Audiology measures the ability to hear pure tones of various frequencies as a function of intensity measured in decibels (dB). The pure tone frequencies evaluated in a complete audiogram are 250 Hz, 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz, 3000 Hz, 4000 Hz, and 8000 Hz. The threshold for each tone is determined by finding the intensity level at which the child can detect the tone 50 percent of the time.</p><p>Hearing is tested with both air and bone conduction. Air conduction, performed with earphones, tests the ability to hear when sound waves travel their normal route through the external auditory canal to the tympanic membrane and the middle ear system. Bone conduction, performed with an oscillator placed on the mastoid bone, tests the ability to hear when the middle ear is bypassed and the inner ear fluid and cochlea are stimulated directly with bone vibration.</p><p>Hearing loss is defined by the pure tone threshold: normal hearing has a threshold of 0 to 20 dB; mild hearing loss from 20 to 40 dB; moderate hearing loss from 40 to 60 dB; severe hearing loss from 60 to 80 dB; and profound hearing loss greater than 80 dB. Characteristic patterns that vary with the type of hearing loss are seen:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The audiogram of a child with a conductive hearing loss shows normal bone-conducted pure tone thresholds and abnormal air-conducted pure tone thresholds. The difference in the air- and bone-conducted thresholds is termed the <span class=\"nowrap\">air/bone</span> gap.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The audiogram of a child with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) shows both air- and bone-conducted pure tone thresholds that are outside of the normal range. Unilateral SNHL usually suggests an inner ear disorder.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Audiograms of children with hereditary hearing loss have a characteristic U-shape, with better hearing in the high and low frequencies than in the middle.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Speech audiometry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Speech audiometry consists of two parts: the speech threshold (also called the speech reception threshold) and the word discrimination score. The speech threshold is the softest level at which a child can correctly repeat 50 percent of presented &quot;spondee&quot; words. Spondee words are usually two-syllable words such as airplane, armchair, or pancake. The speech threshold is recorded in decibels and serves as a cross-check for the pure tone air-conduction thresholds. The speech threshold is typically equal to the pure tone air-conduction average, &plusmn;10 dB. The pure tone average is the average decibel score at 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz.</p><p>The word discrimination score is the percentage of phonetically balanced words that a child can correctly repeat at a given sensation level. Testing is typically performed at 40 dB above the child's speech threshold. This discrimination score serves two purposes: it can establish the prognosis for the use of a hearing aid and it helps determine the site of the lesion. A poor discrimination score usually indicates significant neural degeneration. These individuals may not be good candidates for hearing aids because the aid will amplify sound, but may not permit the child to understand what is being said.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Behavioral testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some children are not able to cooperate with pure tone or speech audiometry testing as described above. Their hearing is assessed using behavioral methods in conjunction with other tests, such as acoustic impedance testing, otoacoustic emissions (OAEs), or auditory brainstem responses (ABRs), as discussed below.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Behavioral observation audiometry &ndash; Behavioral observation audiometry (BOA) is used to examine auditory function in infants younger than six to eight months, children with multiple handicaps, or adults who are not able to cooperate for other types of testing. Live voice, warbled tones, or narrow-band noises are presented in a sound field environment to elicit reflexive and orienting responses to auditory stimuli. The responses can include head or limb reflex, whole-body startle, sucking, eye blinking, raising of the eyebrows, or cessation of certain behaviors, such as movement or sucking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-impairment-in-children-evaluation/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Responses to stimuli are not reinforced.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Behavioral observation is a subjective measure of hearing ability and does not provide ear-specific or frequency-specific information. It is best used in conjunction with objective methods. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Impedance testing'</a> below and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Electrophysiology'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Visual reinforcement audiometry &ndash; Visual reinforcement audiometry (VRA) is used to evaluate the hearing of infants and young children from about six months of age through the second year. Sound stimuli (live voice and tones) are presented in the sound field and via insert earphones. The child is visually rewarded with lighted and animated toys for turning his or her head toward the sound source. The child is conditioned to perform this task repeatedly. An experienced audiologist will use several lighted and animated toys and an intermittent reinforcement schedule to maintain the child's attention. Under ideal circumstances, complete ear-specific information for speech stimuli and interactive frequencies from 250 through 8000 Hz can be obtained.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Play audiometry &ndash; Play audiometry is used to evaluate the hearing of children between the ages of 30 months and 5 years. Pure tones and speech information are presented via insert earphones. The child is taught to perform a simple task, such as placing a block in a bucket or a peg on a pegboard each time a sound is heard. They are expected to perform the task over and over again when they hear the sound. The detection of speech sounds is determined by the child's ability to point to simple pictures when instructed by the audiologist.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Speech understanding or speech discrimination scores are obtained in children who are able to perform the tests. Such tests use picture-pointing tasks for younger children and require reading skills for older children. Speech-understanding testing is used to evaluate the child's ability to hear and understand speech in quiet and noisy listening environments.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Impedance testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Impedance audiometry (also known as immittance audiometry) evaluates the integrity and function of the middle ear system, including middle ear pressure, tympanic membrane mobility, eustachian tube function, continuity and mobility of the ossicles, and acoustic reflex thresholds. It is a quick, noninvasive test that requires little cooperation from the child.</p><p>Full impedance audiometry encompasses tympanometry and stapedial reflex testing. Stapedial reflex testing is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Stapedial reflex'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Tympanometry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tympanometry measures the changes in the acoustic impedance of the middle ear system in response to changes in air pressure. As the pressure increases, the tympanic membrane is pushed medially; as negative pressure is placed, the tympanic membrane protrudes laterally. The point of maximum compliance of the middle ear is identified, indicating the status of air pressure in the middle ear.</p><p>Five types of tympanograms can be seen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67750\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67750 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-impairment-in-children-evaluation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type A &ndash; Normal middle ear pressure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type B &ndash; Little or no mobility, suggestive of fluid behind the tympanic membrane or perforation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type C &ndash; Negative pressure in the middle ear, suggestive of a retracted tympanic membrane</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type A<sub>S</sub> &ndash; A very stiff middle ear system that can be caused by myringosclerosis or otosclerosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type A<sub>D</sub> &ndash; The highly compliant tympanic membrane seen in ossicular chain discontinuity</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electrophysiologic tests of hearing do not require behavioral responses. They include auditory brainstem response (ABRs), otoacoustic emissions (OAEs), and stapedial reflex testing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Brainstem response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If an infant fails a newborn hearing screen or if parents or the pediatric healthcare provider are concerned about hearing, an ABR test should be performed. This test is also known as auditory brainstem evoked response (ABER), brainstem evoked response audiometry (BERA), or brainstem auditory evoked response (BAER). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-the-newborn-for-hearing-loss#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening the newborn for hearing loss&quot;, section on 'Automated auditory brainstem response'</a>.)</p><p>The ABR is used in children who are younger than 30 months, developmentally delayed, intellectually disabled (mentally retarded), are otherwise difficult to test, or for confirmation of behavioral audiometric results. Sedation may be required for more accurate testing, since movement by the child can disrupt ABR results. ABR testing can be used to estimate auditory sensitivity and it provides useful clinical information about the integrity of the eighth nerve pathway. It is not, however, a true test of hearing and should never be used alone or as a substitute for behavioral hearing testing.</p><p>The ABR test uses click stimuli and tone burst stimuli from loud (80 or 90 decibels [dB]) to soft (0 to 20 dB) to evoke responses from the auditory pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-impairment-in-children-evaluation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. These responses are recorded using electrodes placed on the head and ears of the child. A computer averages the responses, and the waveforms generated are compared with normative data.</p><p>Delayed or absent waves suggest cochlear or neurologic deficits. Normal hearing or conductive hearing loss patterns can also be recognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-impairment-in-children-evaluation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Children with central hearing loss, also known as auditory neuropathy, have absent or severely distorted ABRs with preserved OAEs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-impairment-in-children-evaluation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Otoacoustic emissions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OAE tests are used in newborn hearing screening programs and to confirm sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Normal OAE in conjunction with normal audiometry in children who are 6 to 30 months old can eliminate the need for ABR (which requires sedation). In addition, OAE testing has been used to monitor aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity and to differentiate central from peripheral auditory dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-impairment-in-children-evaluation/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-the-newborn-for-hearing-loss#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening the newborn for hearing loss&quot;, section on 'Otoacoustic emissions'</a>.)</p><p>OAEs are faint sounds produced by the electromobile motion of the outer hair cells of the cochlea in a healthy ear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-impairment-in-children-evaluation/abstract/17,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,20</a>]. These sounds are transmitted retrograde through the middle ear and the tympanic membrane and can be measured by a microphone sealed in the external auditory canal. The test is quick and noninvasive. The presence of OAE suggests normal cochlear function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Stapedial reflex</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The acoustic stapedius reflex (ASR) is the sound-evoked contraction of the stapedius muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-impairment-in-children-evaluation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. It is mediated by a neural network with afferent input from the auditory nerve and efferent output to the facial nerve. The central portion of the reflex pathway is comprised of several centers in the brain. ASR is used to evaluate retrocochlear pathology. An ear with a significant conductive hearing loss, however, will also demonstrate abnormal ASR.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with hearing loss should have a complete history, physical examination, and formal audiologic testing to determine the type and etiology of hearing loss (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53903\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53903 \">table 1</a>) and the optimal treatment plan. Infants with hearing loss should be evaluated by an otolaryngologist and have at least one examination to assess visual acuity. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Important aspects of the history include conditions associated with hearing loss (eg, congenital infection, prematurity, hyperbilirubinemia, meningitis, recurrent otitis media, exposure to ototoxic drugs, noise, or barotrauma, kidney disease, cardiac dysrhythmia, or decreased visual acuity), family history of hearing loss or retinitis pigmentosa, the onset and progression of hearing loss, associated symptoms (pain, drainage from the ear, tinnitus, vertigo, disequilibrium), and history of previous ear surgery. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical examination should include measurement of growth parameters and assessment of general appearance (looking for manifestations of syndromic hearing loss) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66758\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66758 \">table 2</a>). Examination of the ear should include inspection of the preauricular area and outer ear (for pits or sinuses, pinna size and shape, patency of the external auditory canal), inspection of the tympanic membrane (for perforation, scarring, middle ear fluid), and pneumatic otoscopy. In older children and adolescents, hearing status can be assessed in the office using 256 Hz and 512 Hz tuning forks. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Objective audiologic screening is recommended for all newborns, and periodically for children between 4 and 11 years of age. Abnormal hearing screening tests should be followed-up with formal audiology. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Office audiology screening'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-tests-in-children-and-adolescents#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening tests in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Hearing screen'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Formal audiologic assessment is performed by an audiologist in a soundproof environment and provides detailed information about hearing ability. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Formal audiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrophysiologic tests of hearing, which do not require behavioral responses, include auditory brainstem response (ABRs), otoacoustic emissions (OAEs), and stapedial reflex testing. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Electrophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The laboratory evaluation of hearing loss is directed by the history, physical examination, and results of audiologic or electrophysiologic testing. All children with newly diagnosed sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) should have a urinalysis, an electrocardiogram, and an eye examination. Other tests that may be indicated are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77212\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77212 \">table 4</a>). A high percentage of hearing loss that presents in infancy and early childhood is genetic. Single gene and simultaneous gene (&quot;gene chips&quot;) testing is becoming increasingly available.
