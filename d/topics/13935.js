The goals of postnatal management of infants with fetal hydronephrosis is to identify those with clinically significant CAKUT while avoiding unnecessary testing in patients with physiologic or clinically insignificant hydronephrosis. In addition, early identification of infants with significant disease allows initiation of interventional therapy that may minimize adverse effects of CAKUT.</p><p>Postnatal management of infants diagnosed with fetal hydronephrosis is reviewed here. The definition, etiology, and prenatal issues of fetal hydronephrosis and specific urologic conditions that may present as fetal hydronephrosis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-fetal-hydronephrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of fetal hydronephrosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-ureteropelvic-junction-obstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital ureteropelvic junction obstruction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-megaureter-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary megaureter in infants and children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ectopic-ureter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ectopic ureter&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BACKGROUND AND MANAGEMENT GOALS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, renal pelvic dilation diagnosed in utero is a transient, physiologic state, however, congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) can present with fetal hydronephrosis due to urinary tract obstruction and vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). These conditions may be associated with impaired <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> normal renal development <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cause renal injury. Nevertheless, the majority of cases of fetal hydronephrosis are not clinically significant, and therefore excessive concern may lead to unnecessary testing of the newborn infant and anxiety for parents and health care providers.</p><p>The goals of postnatal management of infants with fetal hydronephrosis are to identify patients with significant CAKUT while avoiding unnecessary testing in patients with physiologic or clinically insignificant hydronephrosis. Evaluation includes physical examination and the use of imaging studies to detect abnormalities that will require postnatal intervention.</p><p>There is not a single test or finding that accurately differentiates infants with significant disease from those who are normal or have insignificant findings. In our practice, we use an approach based upon the presence of predicative factors (bilateral involvement and severity of persistent fetal hydronephrosis) for postnatal management that limits unnecessary testing and minimizes parental distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postnatal-management-of-fetal-hydronephrosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Approach'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-fetal-hydronephrosis#H17635046\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of fetal hydronephrosis&quot;, section on 'Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT)'</a>.)</p><p>It is important to remember that it is rarely necessary to operate on an obstructed kidney in a neonate in the first few days or weeks of life because the fetal kidneys start to make urine between the fifth and ninth week of gestation; therefore, an additional few days <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> weeks of observation after birth awaiting an accurate diagnosis rarely affects long-term outcome. In addition, the added anesthetic risk in the neonatal period needs to be taken into account. An important exception are patients with posterior urethral valves (PUV), who require intervention to relieve post-bladder obstruction as soon as possible after birth to preserve as much as possible both renal and bladder function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-posterior-urethral-valves#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of posterior urethral valves&quot;, section on 'Postnatal management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The neonatal physical examination can identify abnormalities that are indicative of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), which are associated with fetal hydronephrosis. These include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of an abdominal mass that could represent an enlarged kidney due to obstructive uropathy or multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK).

The timing of ultrasonography and the need for other studies depend upon the severity of fetal hydronephrosis and whether there is bilateral involvement or an affected single kidney.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The preferred initial postnatal imaging study for infants with clinically significant fetal hydronephrosis is an ultrasound examination of the kidneys and bladder. Ultrasonography can detect most congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) associated with fetal hydronephrosis without radiation exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postnatal-management-of-fetal-hydronephrosis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The need and timing of the study depends upon the severity of the fetal hydronephrosis. In general, postnatal evaluation is performed for cases that reach a minimum <strong>prenatal</strong> renal pelvic diameter (RPD) of 10mm based on an antenatal ultrasound performed in the third trimester, as RPDs below this level are unlikely to be associated with CAKUT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-fetal-hydronephrosis#H17635046\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of fetal hydronephrosis&quot;, section on 'Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT)'</a>.)</p><p>In general, examination should be avoided in the first two or three days after birth, because hydronephrosis may not be detected due to extracellular fluid shifts that will underestimate the degree of hydronephrosis. However, infants with bilateral hydronephrosis and those with a hydronephrotic single kidney require more urgent evaluation within 48 hours of birth because of the increased likelihood of significant disease and a possible need for early intervention.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Voiding cystourethrogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) is performed in the majority of neonates with persistent <strong>postnatal</strong> hydronephrosis (RPD &ge;10 mm) to identify patients with bladder outlet obstruction, most commonly posterior urethral valves (PUV), and to detect vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69172\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef69172 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74670\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef74670 \">algorithm 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Approach'</a> below and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Persistent postnatal ultrasound findings'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-posterior-urethral-valves#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of posterior urethral valves&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.) However, data suggest that children with classic UPJ-type obstruction with a normal bladder, nondilated ureter, and normal contralateral kidney, have a low risk of VUR, and VCUG is not warranted in this group of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postnatal-management-of-fetal-hydronephrosis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>For this procedure, a urinary catheter is inserted into the bladder and contrast material is instilled. Fluoroscopic monitoring is performed while the bladder is filling and during voiding. Infants usually tolerate this procedure well. Although the duration of fluoroscopy is minimized, the gonads, especially the ovaries, are exposed to radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postnatal-management-of-fetal-hydronephrosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Diuretic renography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diuretic renography (renal scan and the administration of a diuretic, typically <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">furosemide</a>) is used to diagnose urinary tract obstruction in infants with persistent grade 4 and possibly grade 3 hydronephrosis after a VCUG has demonstrated no VUR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postnatal-management-of-fetal-hydronephrosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. It measures the drainage time from the renal pelvis, and assesses the relative contribution of each kidney to overall renal function.</p><p>The test requires insertion of a bladder catheter to relieve any pressure that can be transmitted to the ureters and kidneys. Intravenous access is needed for hydration and the administration of the radioisotope and diuretic. The preferred radioisotope is technetium-99m-mercaptoacetyltriglycine (Tc99mMAG3), which is taken up by the renal cortex, filtered across the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) to the renal tubules, and excreted into the renal pelvis and urinary tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postnatal-management-of-fetal-hydronephrosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The study includes two phases:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial phase &ndash; Radioisotope is injected intravenously and renal parenchymal (cortical) uptake is measured during the first two to three minutes. The relative contribution of each kidney to overall renal function referred to as <strong>split renal function</strong> is assessed quantitatively. Split renal function is the most useful measure to detect differences in renal function between the two kidneys. As a rule of thumb, spilt renal function of less than 5 percent difference is unlikely to be clinically significant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In patients with unilateral hydronephrosis (which is the most common clinical scenario), if the normal nonhydronephrotic kidney and hydronephrotic kidney both have similar function (ie, difference in split renal function &lt;5 percent), conservative management without surgery is a safe option. Subsequent studies can be compared with the initial baseline scan to determine whether kidney function remains stable or whether increasing differences in split renal function develop that indicate a decrease in the function of the hydronephrotic kidney, most likely due to significant obstruction, which may require intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postnatal-management-of-fetal-hydronephrosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Second phase &ndash; In the second phase, at peak renal uptake, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">furosemide</a> is administered and the excretion of isotope from the kidney is measured (referred to as the &quot;washout curve&quot;). This phase indicates the extent of obstruction, if present. In the normal kidney, the administration of furosemide results in a prompt washout. In a dilated system, if washout occurs rapidly after diuretic administration (&lt;15 minutes), the system is not obstructed. If washout is delayed beyond 20 minutes, the pattern is consistent with obstructive uropathy. However, a delayed washout must be interpreted with caution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postnatal-management-of-fetal-hydronephrosis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. As an example, in a series of 39 infants with antenatal unilateral hydronephrosis followed without surgery, diuretic renography indicated obstruction in 24 patients whose renal function never decreased and thus could not have been obstructed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postnatal-management-of-fetal-hydronephrosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. These results may partly be due to the normally low neonatal glomerular filtration rate (GFR) that can be refractory to diuretic therapy. If washout is between 15 and 20 minutes, the study is considered indeterminate.</p><p/><p>A number of factors can affect the accuracy of the diuretic renogram. This includes the state of hydration of the infant, the functionality of the bladder catheter, the timing of diuretic administration, the accuracy of physically outlining the renal tissue in the presence of severe hydronephrosis, and the background effect from the liver and spleen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Magnetic resonance urography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnetic resonance urography (MRU) in children is becoming more commonly used in the diagnosis and management of congenital uropathies, such as ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postnatal-management-of-fetal-hydronephrosis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. MRU is especially useful in the management of obstructed kidneys that have rotation or ascent anomalies, or are single. MRU can more clearly define the anatomy and delineate the proper surgical approach (ie, retroperitoneal versus transperitoneal). The disadvantage of MRU is that the study often requires general anesthesia or heavy conscious sedation in children. However, for patients in the newborn period, many centers are now performing &quot;swaddle MRI&quot; after the infant falls asleep after feeding, thus avoiding general anesthesia and conscious sedation. Another disadvantage is the use of the contrast agent gadolinium, which can only be used if the renal function is normal (requiring a preprocedure serum creatinine test) because of reports of irreversible renal fibrosis in patients with renal insufficiency. Newer MRU technology may even define obstruction, eliminating the need for diuretic renal scans.

Infants with fetal bilateral hydronephrosis or those with a hydronephrotic single kidney with a renal pelvic diameter (RPD) &gt;10 mm in the third trimester should be initially evaluated by ultrasonography on the first to second postnatal day (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69172\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef69172 \">algorithm 1</a>). Bilateral hydronephrosis suggests an obstructive process at the level of or distal to the bladder, such as ureterocele, or posterior urethral valves (PUV) in a male infant, which can be associated with impaired renal function and ongoing renal injury.</p><p>If the postnatal ultrasound demonstrates persistent hydronephrosis, a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) should be performed to identify cases of PUV or bilateral vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).

In our center, antibiotic prophylaxis is not generally administered to infants with low-grade and moderate-grade fetal hydronephrosis (ie, SFU grades I, II, and III, or an RPD &le;12 mm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postnatal-management-of-fetal-hydronephrosis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].

In our practice, antibiotic prophylaxis is continued for cases with severe SFU grade IV hydronephrosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50549\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50549 \">image 1</a>) or RPD &ge;15 mm until surgical correction is performed or there is a decrease in the severity of hydronephrosis detected by ultrasonography (RPD &lt;15 mm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postnatal-management-of-fetal-hydronephrosis/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. It is prudent to remember that prior to the era of prenatal sonography, ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) typically presented with urosepsis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-ureteropelvic-junction-obstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital ureteropelvic junction obstruction&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In our center, infants with <strong>moderate</strong> postnatal hydronephrosis (RPD 10 to &lt;15 mm) have a repeat ultrasound when they reach four to six months of age. The majority of cases with mild or moderate postnatal hydronephrosis resolve by 18 months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postnatal-management-of-fetal-hydronephrosis/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. If the degree of hydronephrosis increases in subsequent ultrasounds, diuretic renography may be performed to determine if there is an obstructive process.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, in a small number of patients, hydronephrosis may worsen after initial improvement. In a retrospective review, 4 of 394 kidneys (1 percent) with hydronephrosis followed nonoperatively worsened after initial spontaneous improvement on renal ultrasonography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postnatal-management-of-fetal-hydronephrosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. All four patients presented with clinical symptoms including abdominal pain, gross hematuria, and vomiting at a mean age of 40 months (range 22 to 60 months), consistent with a diagnosis of intermittent UPJO requiring pyeloplasty.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As a result, if there is persistent dilation at three months of age, we continue to monitor the degree of hydronephrosis with an ultrasound performed at one year of age, and if needed, between three and five years of age. In symptomatic cases, or if there is a marked increase in dilation, diuretic renography may be performed to determine if there is an obstructive process.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Normal ultrasound or mild hydronephrosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants with a normal postnatal examination or mild hydronephrosis (defined as an RPD &le;10 mm without any evidence of calyceal or ureteric dilation, or signs of renal dysplasia or anomalies) require no further evaluation. This was supported in one study of patients with fetal hydronephrosis and normal postnatal ultrasounds that demonstrated normal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dimercaptosuccinic-acid-succimer-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dimercaptosuccinic acid</a> (DMSA) scans in 49 of the 103 children available for evaluation at two years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postnatal-management-of-fetal-hydronephrosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].
