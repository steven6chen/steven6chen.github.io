The purpose of this review is to discuss the physiologic basis for functional exercise testing, methodologic considerations, and clinical applications. Cardiologists have used this technique most often in the evaluation and management of patients with heart failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-capacity-and-vo2-in-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise capacity and VO2 in heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGIC ASPECTS OF EXERCISE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An understanding of exercise physiology and the Fick equation is a prerequisite for appreciating the utility of functional exercise testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-physiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise physiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Aerobic parameters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Fick equation states that oxygen uptake equals cardiac output times the arterial-mixed venous oxygen content difference. This is usually expressed as follows:</p><p>Vo<sub>2</sub> &#160;= &#160;(SV &#160;x &#160;HR) &#160;x &#160;(CaO<sub>2</sub> &#160;- &#160;CvO<sub>2</sub>)</p><p>where Vo<sub>2</sub> is the oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) uptake, SV is the stroke volume, HR is heart rate, CaO<sub>2</sub> is arterial oxygen content, and CvO<sub>2</sub> is the mixed venous oxygen content. Oxygen uptake is often normalized for body weight and expressed in units of mL O<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/kg</span> per min. One metabolic equivalent (MET) is the resting oxygen uptake in a sitting position and equals 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per min.</p><p>At maximal exercise, the Fick equation is expressed as follows:</p><p>Vo<sub>2</sub>max &#160;= &#160;(SVmax &#160;x &#160;HRmax) &#160;x &#160;(CaO<sub>2</sub>max &#160;- &#160;CvO<sub>2</sub>min)</p><p>The Vo<sub>2</sub>max reflects the maximal ability of a person to take in, transport, and use oxygen, and it defines that person's functional aerobic capacity. Vo<sub>2</sub>max has become the &quot;gold standard&quot; laboratory measure of cardiorespiratory fitness and is the most important parameter measured during functional exercise testing. Although some investigators insist that a Vo<sub>2</sub> plateau occurs at near maximal exercise, this is not always seen. It has been suggested that the term &quot;peak Vo<sub>2</sub>&quot; be used instead of Vo<sub>2</sub>max to define this situation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-exercise-testing-ventilatory-gas-analysis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Several important changes occur in the Fick equation as a healthy person goes from rest to maximal exercise before and after exercise training (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63505\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63505 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-exercise-testing-ventilatory-gas-analysis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Vo<sub>2</sub>max response to exercise is linear until maximal Vo<sub>2</sub> is achieved. In many individuals, there is a plateau at near maximal exercise beyond which the Vo<sub>2</sub> does not change. Exercise training enables the person to achieve a greater maximal workload and a higher Vo<sub>2</sub>max.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The heart rate response is linear up to a maximal heart rate that approximately equals &quot;220 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min</span> - age.&quot; After training, the heart rate is lower at rest and at each stage of exercise, but the maximal heart rate does not change.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The stroke volume response is curvilinear, increasing early in exercise with little change thereafter. The training effect increases the resting stroke volume and the stroke volume at each workload.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The a-v O<sub>2</sub> content difference widens as the mixed venous O<sub>2</sub> content falls since arterial O<sub>2</sub> content does not change in normal subjects. The maximal a-v O<sub>2</sub> content difference increases after training.</p><p/><p>Functional aerobic impairment (ie, exercise intolerance) is defined as an abnormally low Vo<sub>2</sub>max. This can occur with any factor that affects one or more of the four parameters of the Fick equation that determine Vo<sub>2</sub>max: a reduction in maximal heart rate, maximal stroke volume, or maximal CaO<sub>2</sub>; or an increase in minimal CvO<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57900\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57900 \">figure 2</a>). As an example, the major factor limiting Vo<sub>2</sub>max in patients with heart failure (HF) is the marked reduction in stroke volume response to exercise with smaller reductions in maximal heart rate and maximal a-v O<sub>2</sub> content difference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-exercise-testing-ventilatory-gas-analysis/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p>Other conditions that can compromise stroke volume are segmental wall motion abnormalities and valvular stenosis or regurgitation. On the other hand, diseases of the lungs, skeletal muscles, and hematologic system often have a profound effect on Vo<sub>2</sub>max by affecting arterial or mixed venous oxygen content.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Anaerobic parameters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there is still considerable debate in the literature concerning the validity of the ventilatory anaerobic threshold (VAT), functional exercise testing often includes such measurements because it is clinically useful in assessing functional impairment in patients with HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-exercise-testing-ventilatory-gas-analysis/abstract/1,4,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,6,7</a>].</p><p>During the initial (aerobic) phase of a progressive exercise test, which lasts until 50 to 60 percent of Vo<sub>2</sub>max is reached, expired ventilation (VE) increases linearly with Vo<sub>2</sub> and reflects aerobically produced CO<sub>2</sub> in the muscles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F69342\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69342 \">figure 3</a>). Blood lactate levels do not change substantially during this phase, since muscle lactic acid production is minimal.</p><p>During the latter half of exercise, anaerobic metabolism occurs because oxygen supply cannot keep up with the increasing metabolic requirements of exercising muscle. At this time, there is a significant increase in lactic acid production in the muscles and in the blood lactate concentration. The Vo<sub>2</sub> at the onset of blood lactate accumulation is called the lactate threshold or anaerobic threshold.</p><p>In the peripheral blood, almost all the lactic acid is buffered by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> according to the following reactions:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;Lactic acid &#160;+ &#160;NaHCO<sub>3</sub> &#160; = &#160; Na lactate &#160;+ &#160;CO<sub>2</sub> &#160;+ &#160;H<sub>2</sub>O</p></div></div><p>The excess CO<sub>2</sub> produced during the buffering process is added to the aerobically produced CO<sub>2</sub>, causing expired ventilation to increase more steeply during the later stages of exercise. It is during this phase that exercising subjects begin to experience dyspnea.</p><p>Because the change in expired ventilation at the onset of anaerobic metabolism is reasonably well defined, noninvasive methods have been developed to detect this transition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-exercise-testing-ventilatory-gas-analysis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The Vo<sub>2</sub> at the onset of this ventilatory change is appropriately called the ventilatory threshold (VAT) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F69342\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69342 \">figure 3</a>). However, the validity of these noninvasive measures and whether or not a true threshold exists remain controversial.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">METHODS OF FUNCTIONAL EXERCISE TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several different methods exist for measuring ventilation and respiratory gas parameters during exercise. Most clinical systems rely on breath-by-breath analysis techniques because they provide the best measures of the metabolic response to exercise. Functional exercise testing procedures and interpretation are reviewed in a 2010 American Heart Association guide to cardiopulmonary exercise testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-exercise-testing-ventilatory-gas-analysis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Gas analysis techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three basic parameters are continuously monitored at the mouthpiece during a breath-by-breath exercise study:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Percent O<sub>2</sub></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Percent CO<sub>2</sub></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory airflow</p><p/><p>A nonrebreathing valve is connected to the mouthpiece to prevent mixing of inspired and expired air. Oxygen and carbon dioxide gas analyzers are usually incorporated in a &quot;metabolic cart&quot; designed specifically for functional testing. Respiratory volumes are computed by integrating the air flow signals over the time of inspiration and expiration. Breath-by-breath volumes of O<sub>2</sub> intake, CO<sub>2</sub> output, and expired ventilation are obtained by integrating the continuous variables over the time course of inspiration (for O<sub>2</sub>), and expiration (for CO<sub>2</sub> and expired ventilation [VE]). Average minute volumes are derived from the breath-by-breath data multiplied by the respiratory rate. The gas volumes obtained under ambient conditions are then converted to STPD (standard temperature and pressure, dry) conditions using the appropriate conversion equations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Exercise test protocols</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many different protocols are used for functional testing (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-ecg-testing-performing-the-test-and-interpreting-the-ecg-results\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise ECG testing: Performing the test and interpreting the ECG results&quot;</a>). The purpose of the test and the functional capabilities of the patient determine the choice of protocol. In evaluating patients with heart failure (HF), both bicycle and treadmill protocols have been used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79768\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79768 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p>The rate of workload progression is somewhat arbitrary, although it has been suggested that optimal exercise duration for functional assessment on the bicycle is between 8 and 17 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-exercise-testing-ventilatory-gas-analysis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Bicycle work is quantified in watts or in kilopond meters per min <span class=\"nowrap\">(kpm/min;</span> 1 watt equals approximately 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">kpm/min)</span>. The initial workload for patients with HF patients is usually 20 to 25 watts and increased by 15 to 25 watts every two minutes until maximal exertion is reached. Alternatively, the workload can be computer controlled for electronically-braked bicycle ergometers, and a ramp protocol (eg, increasing by 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">watts/min)</span> is often used.</p><p>The modified Naughton protocol is recommended for treadmill exercise testing in patients with HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-exercise-testing-ventilatory-gas-analysis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This protocol is designed to increase the workload by approximately 1 metabolic equivalent (MET) (3.5 mL O<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/kg/min)</span> for each two-minute stage.</p><p>Patients with heart disease require continuous electrocardiogram monitoring and frequent blood pressure measurements during exercise testing. Hand signals (eg, one to five fingers for perceived intensity and thumbs down to stop) are used by the patient during exercise, since verbal communication is usually not possible with the mouthpiece apparatus.</p><p>Symptoms at maximal exercise that result in test termination include muscle fatigue, exhaustion, extreme dyspnea, and lightheadedness. Cardiac arrhythmias are usually not an indication to stop the test unless sustained tachyarrhythmias develop or the physician monitoring the test feels that further exercise is contraindicated.</p><p>A decrease in systolic blood pressure below the resting pressure is a sign of severe left ventricular dysfunction and an indication to stop the test. However, many patients with HF fail to significantly increase their systolic pressure during exercise because of left ventricular dysfunction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Ventilatory anaerobic threshold determination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several methods for estimating the ventilatory threshold (VAT) from the respiratory gas data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-exercise-testing-ventilatory-gas-analysis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The VAT or the Vo<sub>2</sub> at the onset of anaerobic metabolism is visually identified as the onset of a disproportionate rise in <span class=\"nowrap\">VE/Vo<sub>2</sub></span> relative to <span class=\"nowrap\">VE/Vco<sub>2</sub></span>. This occurs because CO<sub>2</sub> production rather than O<sub>2</sub> consumption is driving ventilation; a rise in <span class=\"nowrap\">VE/Vo<sub>2</sub></span> without a change in <span class=\"nowrap\">VE/Vco<sub>2</sub></span> indicates that ventilation is increasing in parallel with the increased CO<sub>2</sub> production that occurs with anaerobic metabolism.</p><p>The VAT is usually visually detected from the plotted breath-by-breath data. The VAT can also be visually identified as a disproportionate rise of Vco<sub>2</sub> or VE relative to Vo<sub>2</sub> or a disproportionate rise in end-tidal O<sub>2</sub> relative to end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Unfortunately, there is considerable inter- and intra-observer variability in the visual detection of the onset of anaerobic metabolism from the breath-by-breath data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-exercise-testing-ventilatory-gas-analysis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. To overcome this problem, computer-detection algorithms have been developed to more objectively measure the anaerobic threshold. One successful approach is called the &quot;V-slope method&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F50602\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50602 \">figure 5</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-exercise-testing-ventilatory-gas-analysis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>With this method, the breath-by-breath Vco<sub>2</sub> data are plotted against Vo<sub>2</sub>, and the computer selects the upper and lower slopes by a least-square linear regression technique. The intersection of the two slopes identifies the anaerobic threshold. One can also visually select the breakpoint from the plot of Vco<sub>2</sub> versus Vo<sub>2</sub> with less ambiguity than when using the ventilatory equivalent data.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL APPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC/AHA)</span> Update of Practice Guidelines for Exercise Testing listed the following indications for ordering a functional Vo<sub>2</sub> exercise test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65640\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65640 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-exercise-testing-ventilatory-gas-analysis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation of exercise capacity and response to therapy in patients with heart failure (HF) who are being considered for heart transplantation.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-and-contraindications-for-cardiac-transplantation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications and contraindications for cardiac transplantation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assistance in the differentiation of cardiac versus pulmonary limitations as a cause of exercise-induced dyspnea or impaired exercise capacity when the cause is uncertain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation of exercise capacity when indicated for medical reasons in patients in whom the estimates of exercise capacity from exercise test time or work rate are unreliable.</p><p/><p>A scientific statement from the AHA and a joint scientific statement from the European Association for Cardiovascular Prevention and AHA provide guidance on clinical applications for cardiopulmonary exercise testing, including evaluation of patients with heart failure, unexplained dyspnea, and skeletal muscle disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-exercise-testing-ventilatory-gas-analysis/abstract/8,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,16</a>]. </p><p>The functional Vo<sub>2</sub> exercise test is a global test of a patient's cardiorespiratory capacity, since it reflects the entire oxygen transport system beginning with the lungs and pulmonary circulation, including the heart, the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, the peripheral circulation, and the skeletal muscles. This objective global assessment offers advantages over other methods to assess the severity of HF:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The traditional New York Heart Association classification of functional impairment in HF is not always accurate because it is based upon a patient's symptoms rather than on objective criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52683 \">table 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-exercise-testing-ventilatory-gas-analysis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resting central hemodynamics, such as cardiac index, ejection fraction, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures do not always correlate well with functional impairment measured during exercise testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-exercise-testing-ventilatory-gas-analysis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The symptoms of exercise intolerance in HF, such as dyspnea on minimal exertion, fatigue, or both, result from a complex interplay of mechanisms originating from both the central and peripheral components of the oxygen transport system. These symptoms are nonspecific and may also be due to medication side effects or other coexisting conditions that may or may not be related to the underlying heart disease.</p><p/><p>Thus, the exercise test is often helpful for classifying disease severity for treatment decisions and in the differential diagnosis of exercise intolerance and symptoms of dyspnea and fatigue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57900\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57900 \">figure 2</a>). Knowledge of the factors that can adversely affect the Fick equation parameters and result in a low Vo<sub>2</sub>max combined with the results of functional exercise testing and other ancillary tests (eg, pulmonary function tests) often leads to the correct diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Prognosis of heart disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The parameters obtained during functional exercise testing also have prognostic importance. Several studies have found that ventilatory parameters are better predictors of HF mortality than Vo<sub>2</sub>max [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-exercise-testing-ventilatory-gas-analysis/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. In a study of 470 patients, for example, an abnormal elevation in the ratio of peak minute ventilation to CO<sub>2</sub> production <span class=\"nowrap\">(VE/Vco<sub>2</sub></span> &ge;44.7) was the strongest predictor of death during 1.5-year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-exercise-testing-ventilatory-gas-analysis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>An enhanced ventilatory response to exercise is a marker of decreased ventilatory efficiency, and is predictive of outcome in patients with preserved exercise capacity. In one study of 123 patients with a Vo<sub>2</sub>max &ge;18 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per minute, the three-year survival was significantly lower in those with a <span class=\"nowrap\">VE/Vco<sub>2</sub></span> &gt;34 (57 versus 93 percent for <span class=\"nowrap\">VE/Vco<sub>2</sub></span> &le;34) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-exercise-testing-ventilatory-gas-analysis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-capacity-and-vo2-in-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise capacity and VO2 in heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most studies of functional exercise testing in heart failure focused primarily on patients with systolic dysfunction. The prognostic importance of peak Vo<sub>2</sub> and <span class=\"nowrap\">VE/Vco<sub>2</sub></span> was evaluated in a mixed population of 409 HF patients with both systolic and diastolic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-exercise-testing-ventilatory-gas-analysis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Depending upon the definition of diastolic HF that was applied (ie, HF with an left ventricular ejection fraction &ge;40, &ge;45 or &ge;50 percent), the number of patients with diastolic HF and the optimal predictors of outcome varied. However, regardless of which definition was used, both peak Vo<sub>2</sub> and the <span class=\"nowrap\">VE/Vco<sub>2</sub></span> slope were predictors of one year event-free survival (mortality and cardiac-related hospitalization) in patients with diastolic HF.</p><p>An objective grading system that is based upon values of Vo<sub>2</sub>max and the anaerobic threshold has been proposed that is especially applicable to patients with chronic HF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F82568\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82568 \">table 3</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-exercise-testing-ventilatory-gas-analysis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Because of the close relationship between Vo<sub>2</sub>max and the maximal cardiac index, the grading system provides an excellent measure of disease severity.</p><p>This classification, although widely used, can be criticized because it fails to consider age, sex, and weight differences in Vo<sub>2</sub>max that occur in normal subjects. Vo<sub>2</sub>max declines with age and is lower in women than in men; as a result, it may be more appropriate to use age- and sex-specific normal values and to classify impairment as a percentage reduction from these normal values. Formulas for predicting Vo<sub>2</sub>max in normal sedentary adults have been published for both cycle ergometry and treadmill testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-exercise-testing-ventilatory-gas-analysis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Functional exercise testing may have long-term predictive value in patients with coronary heart disease. This was illustrated in a study of over 12,000 men who were referred for cardiac rehabilitation (post-myocardial infarction, post-coronary artery bypass graft surgery, or new ischemic heart disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-exercise-testing-ventilatory-gas-analysis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. At a median follow-up of 7.9 years, Vo<sub>2</sub>max &lt;15, 15 to 22, and &gt;22 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per min were associated with adjusted hazard ratios for cardiac death of 1.0, 0.62, and 0.39, respectively; similar values were noted for all-cause mortality. The only other significant predictors of cardiac mortality in the different groups were smoking and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> therapy.</p><p>It is important that physicians performing these tests understand the different procedures for analyzing and interpreting the respiratory gas data. Knowledge of calibration techniques and equipment maintenance is also an important prerequisite in providing accurate functional assessments in the exercise laboratory. It is likely that the number of exercise Vo<sub>2</sub> studies will increase in the future as new and innovative therapies for chronic HF become available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1296180809\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
