The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom developed a similar checklist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-pregnancy-prediction-of-preeclampsia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>In a 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies including &ge;1000 patients that evaluated the risk of preeclampsia in relation to common clinical risk factors assessed at &le;16 weeks of gestation, the highest rate of preeclampsia occurred in women with antiphospholipid syndrome (pooled rate 17.3 percent, pooled relative risk [RR] 2.8), and the highest relative risk of preeclampsia occurred in women with a past history of the disease (pooled rate 12 percent, pooled RR 8.4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-pregnancy-prediction-of-preeclampsia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

However, current models have low positive predictive value. One reason may be insufficiently accounting for factors that mitigate risk, such as a previous normotensive pregnancy. Another reason may involve not distinguishing between early-onset and late-onset preeclampsia, which have different risk profiles and recurrence rates. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Risk prediction models'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3173286781\"><span class=\"h2\">Early prenatal assessments of women at high risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women who are at high risk of developing preeclampsia, establishing gestational age, baseline blood pressure, and baseline laboratory values, including platelet count, creatinine concentration, liver function tests, and 24-hour urinary protein estimation early in pregnancy can be helpful later in gestation in distinguishing preeclampsia from underlying disorders associated with similar clinical and laboratory findings.

Obese women can reduce their risk of developing preeclampsia by losing weight before pregnancy and limiting weight gain during pregnancy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fertility and pregnancy after bariatric surgery&quot;, section on 'Preeclampsia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=weight-gain-and-loss-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Weight gain and loss in pregnancy&quot;</a>).

For women at low risk for development of preeclampsia, available evidence does not support use of low-dose aspirin for prevention of preeclampsia, but a modest (approximately 10 percent) reduction in the risk of preeclampsia and its sequelae (growth restriction, preterm birth) is possible for women at moderate to high risk of developing the disease. The evidence for this approach is reviewed separately.

Based on data from patients with established preeclampsia, a wide variety of laboratory and imaging tests have been proposed to detect subgroups of women at high risk of developing the disease. Because the prevalence of preeclampsia in the general obstetric population is relatively low (1 to 7 percent), a test would need very high sensitivity and specificity to accurately predict or exclude the development of the disease. Systematic reviews of studies that evaluated clinically available tests have generally concluded that these tests are not sufficiently accurate (high sensitivity and specificity) for screening the general obstetric population and that the overall methodological quality of available studies was generally poor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-pregnancy-prediction-of-preeclampsia/abstract/5,14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,14-17</a>]. For this reason, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends taking a detailed medical history to assess a patient's risks for developing preeclampsia, and recommends against the use of laboratory and imaging screening tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-pregnancy-prediction-of-preeclampsia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The utility of systematic reviews of tests for prediction of preeclampsia has been limited by several factors, including (1) variation in the definition of preeclampsia, which introduces heterogeneity in the classification of the syndrome; (2) variation in <span class=\"nowrap\">inclusion/exclusion</span> criteria, which also increases heterogeneity; (3) variation in the criteria defining level of risk (low versus high) of a given population (some studies of low-risk populations have had preeclampsia incidence rates higher than high-risk populations in other studies); (4) multiplicity of potential tests, test combinations, and timing of screening during pregnancy; (5) lack of inclusion of specific important information; and (6) flawed study design <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> conduct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-pregnancy-prediction-of-preeclampsia/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Biomarkers</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2578005277\"><span class=\"h4\">Angiogenic modulators</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data from both human and animal models suggest that aberrant expression of angiogenic modulators is important in the pathogenesis of diffuse endothelial injury and increased capillary permeability, which are the pathophysiologic hallmarks of preeclampsia. The angiogenic factors of interest include vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and placental growth factor (PlGF), as well as two anti-angiogenic proteins, soluble endoglin (sEng) and the truncated form of the full-length VEGF receptor type-1 (Flt-1), known as soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1). </p><p>Ischemic trophoblast, which is a characteristic finding in preeclampsia, increases production of anti-angiogenic proteins (sEng, sFlt1) and reduces production of angiogenic proteins (VEGF, PlGF).

The concentrations of PlGF and VEGF were lower in women who developed preeclampsia and the concentrations of sFlt-1 and sEng were higher in these women; the summary diagnostic odds ratios (ORs) were: PlGF 9.0 (95% CI 5.6-14.5), sFlt-1 6.6 (95% CI 3.1-13.7), sEng 4.2 (95% CI 2.4-7.2), which correspond to sensitivities of 32, 26, and 18 percent, respectively, with a 5 percent false-positive rate. However, when assessed by gestational age, most of the markers did not perform well in the first half of pregnancy and had better performance after 30 weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinary PlGF also does not perform well in early pregnancy as a screening test. A nested case-control study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-pregnancy-prediction-of-preeclampsia/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>] evaluated urine PlGF to predict preeclampsia using stored urine specimens from women who had been enrolled in the Calcium for Preeclampsia Prevention trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-pregnancy-prediction-of-preeclampsia/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>], which included healthy nulliparous women with singleton pregnancies followed from between 13 and 21 weeks of gestation until 24 hours postpartum. Urine samples were collected before enrollment, at 26 to 29 weeks of gestation, at 36 weeks, and at onset of preeclampsia. Baseline urinary PlGF levels at 8 to 21 weeks of gestation were not significantly different between women who developed preeclampsia and those who remained normotensive.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, the test was predictive of preeclampsia late in gestation. Women who went on to develop preeclampsia had lower levels of PlGF than controls at each sampling interval from 25 weeks through onset of disease.

Fractional excretion modeling (ratios) may offer advantages over absolute levels of urinary angiogenic factors for identifying women at risk for developing preeclampsia since ratios account for dilutional effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-pregnancy-prediction-of-preeclampsia/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The sFlt-1:PlGF ratio may be the best test for predicting preeclampsia, but like the above tests is not useful early in pregnancy. In a 2018 systematic review that evaluated the sFlt-1:PlGF ratio in blood for prediction of preeclampsia (15 studies, 534 cases of preeclampsia and 19,587 controls), pooled sensitivity was 80 percent (95% CI 0.68-0.88), specificity 92 percent (95% CI 0.87-0.96), positive likelihood ratio 10.5 (95% CI 6.2-18.0), and a negative likelihood ratio 0.22 (95% CI 0.13&ndash;0.35) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-pregnancy-prediction-of-preeclampsia/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. However, all of these women were at least 20 weeks of gestation.

Increased impedance for gestational age is an early radiographic feature of preeclampsia and likely reflects high downstream resistance due to defective differentiation of trophoblast, which leads to defective invasion of spiral arteries and failure of these vessels to transform into low resistance vessels.</p><p>Two types of uterine artery Doppler waveform analysis techniques have emerged for prediction of preeclampsia as well as other disorders associated with impaired placentation (eg, fetal growth restriction, pregnancy loss): (1) presence or absence of diastolic notching (unilateral, bilateral) of the uterine arcuate vessels and (2) flow waveform ratios (eg, high resistance or pulsatility index, <span class=\"nowrap\">systolic/diastolic</span> ratio).</p><p>The use of uterine artery Doppler velocimetry for prediction of preeclampsia was best illustrated in a 2008 systematic review of 74 studies including almost 80,000 women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-pregnancy-prediction-of-preeclampsia/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. These studies involved 15 uterine artery Doppler indices and women at either low or high risk of developing preeclampsia. The authors found that uterine artery Doppler ultrasonography was more accurate for prediction of preeclampsia when performed in the second trimester than in the first trimester. In women at high risk of developing preeclampsia, the overall risk of preeclampsia was best predicted by second-trimester elevation of pulsatility index accompanied by uterine artery notching (sensitivity 19 percent, specificity 99 percent, positive likelihood ratio [+LR] 21, negative likelihood ratio [-LR] 0.82), and the risk of severe preeclampsia was best predicted by second-trimester elevated resistance index (sensitivity 80 percent, specificity 78 percent, +LR 3.7, -LR 0.26). </p><p>Studies of uterine artery Doppler velocimetry for prediction of preeclampsia are difficult to compare because investigators have used different Doppler sampling techniques, definitions of abnormal flow velocity waveform, populations, gestational age at examination, and criteria for the diagnosis of preeclampsia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk prediction models</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As described above, specific maternal characteristics, Doppler ultrasound findings, and biomarkers in blood are associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia.

Ideally, women identified as high risk would be encouraged to address any modifiable risk factors, educated about the signs and symptoms of preeclampsia so they will notify their provider as soon as clinical manifestations occur, and followed with more frequent office visits.

Furthermore, methodological deficiencies are common, which limits their reliability and validity. For example, a 2015 systematic review evaluated 24 studies of 38 predictive models that included uterine artery Doppler as one of the independent variables [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-pregnancy-prediction-of-preeclampsia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The median number of study participants was 697, the median number of cases of preeclampsia per model was 37, and the median number of risk predictors was 5.

By quantifying the risk of preeclampsia conferred by various individual clinical risk factors, the clinician is better equipped to estimate a woman's risk of preeclampsia, educate her about this risk and its implications, determine the appropriate frequency of pregnancy surveillance, and consider whether she is a candidate for prophylactic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>. (See <a href=\"#H3498824244\" class=\"local\">'Identifying women at high risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most risk factors for preeclampsia are not modifiable; avoiding obesity and excessive gestational weight gain are notable exceptions. (See <a href=\"#H830566426\" class=\"local\">'Interventions to reduce risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> is the only drug for which there is some evidence of benefit in reducing the risk of preeclampsia when administered throughout the second and third trimesters to women at high risk for developing the disease. For women at low risk for development of preeclampsia, available evidence does not support use of low-dose aspirin for prevention of preeclampsia, but a modest (approximately 10 percent) reduction in the risk of preeclampsia and its sequelae (growth restriction, preterm birth) is possible for women at moderate to high risk of developing the disease. (See <a href=\"#H830566426\" class=\"local\">'Interventions to reduce risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women who are at high risk of developing preeclampsia, establishing gestational age, baseline blood pressure, and baseline laboratory values including platelet count, creatinine concentration, liver function tests, and urinary protein estimation early in pregnancy can be helpful later in gestation in distinguishing preeclampsia from underlying disorders associated with similar clinical and laboratory findings. (See <a href=\"#H3173286781\" class=\"local\">'Early prenatal assessments of women at high risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A wide variety of laboratory and imaging tests have been proposed to distinguish women who will develop preeclampsia from those who will not. Systematic reviews of studies that evaluated clinically available tests have generally concluded that these tests were not sufficiently accurate for screening the general obstetric population and that the overall methodological quality of available studies was generally poor. For this reason, we agree with American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommendations for taking a detailed medical history to assess a patient's risks for developing preeclampsia but not using laboratory and imaging screening tests (including uterine artery Doppler velocimetry and serum biomarkers such as pro- and anti-angiogenic factors). (See <a href=\"#H144643848\" class=\"local\">'Screening tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specific maternal characteristics, Doppler ultrasound findings, and biomarkers in blood are associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia. Multiple investigators have used these variables in logistic regression analysis to create tools to predict an individual woman's risk of developing preeclampsia while she is still early in pregnancy. We do not use these tools because they have low positive predictive values, so many women will be made anxious and treated unnecessarily, and methodological deficiencies are common, which limits their reliability and validity.
