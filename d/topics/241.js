Most cases are due to cellular rejection. Antibody-mediated (noncellular, vascular, humoral) rejection is a less well understood and less easily diagnosed process, but potentially produces morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The 2009 report from the Registry of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) of patients with one-year follow-up between July 2004 and July 2008 found that 21 to 30 percent were treated for rejection during the first year after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This represents an underestimate for overall rejection, since the Registry did not collect data on mild rejection episodes (grade 1 R) or on antibody-mediated rejection (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'ISHLT grading system'</a> below). The 2014 registry report noted that the incidence of any rejection between discharge and one year decreased from 30 percent for primary transplants in 2004 to 2006, to 25 percent in 2010 to 2011. Furthermore, with the recognition that mild cellular rejection may not need acute treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], the incidence of treated rejection decreased from 23 percent for primary transplants in 2004 to 2006, to 13 percent in 2010 to 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>In the 2009 ISHLT report, among deaths occurring between January 1992 and June 2008, acute rejection accounted for 6 percent of deaths in the first 30 days, 12 percent from 31 days to one year, 10 percent from one year to three years, and less than 2 percent at more than five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The contribution of rejection to post-transplant mortality has decreased over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>]. This is primarily due to improvements in maintenance immunosuppression and in the diagnosis and treatment of rejection. Nevertheless, acute heart allograft rejection remains an important clinical problem. In the 2014 ISHLT registry report, acute rejection accounted for no more than 11 percent of deaths in the first three years, but acute and chronic immune injury are likely important contributors to graft failure, which remains a leading cause of death throughout follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the risk factors for and the clinical features and diagnostic evaluation of acute cellular rejection in the heart transplant recipient. The treatment of acute rejection is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute cardiac allograft rejection: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although acute cellular rejection is always a potential concern in a heart transplant recipient, the likelihood of a rejection episode is influenced by several factors, particularly the time after transplantation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Time after transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute cellular rejection is much more common early after a heart transplant. In a multicenter analysis by the Cardiac Transplant Research Database of 1251 patients transplanted between 1990 and 1993, the incidence of cellular rejection peaked at one month after transplant, then declined rapidly over the subsequent five months, reaching a low constant rate by the end of the first year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The mean number of rejection episodes per patient in the first, second, third, and fourth years was 1.25, 0.18, 0.13 and 0.02, respectively. Newer immunosuppressive strategies have resulted in significant delays in the time that acute cellular rejection occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Freedom from hospitalization for rejection has improved considerably during the last 20 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Type of immunosuppression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) Registry, a nonrandomized data set, has attempted to delineate important determinants for cellular rejection in the first year following transplant. Since the data are not randomized, a cause-and-effect relationship cannot be assumed.</p><p>Patients who at transplant discharge were receiving tacrolimus-based immunosuppression, particularly when in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil, had lower rates of treated rejection (but not ISHLT grade &gt;2R rejection) than those receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> in combination with mycophenolate mofetil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A similar observation was noted in the 2009 ISHLT report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Variables that appear to increase the risk of rejection include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Younger recipient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/7,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10,11</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Female recipient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/7,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Female donor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/7,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10,11</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Black recipient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More HLA mismatches between the donor and recipient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of intensive (protocol) surveillance, most cases of acute cellular rejection are diagnosed by endomyocardial biopsy at a time when the patient is asymptomatic. In a review from the Cardiac Transplant Research Database of 3367 patients experiencing 4137 episodes of cellular rejection on either surveillance or clinically indicated endomyocardial biopsy, severe hemodynamic compromise was present in only about 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>When symptoms do occur, they are most often manifestations of left ventricular dysfunction such as dyspnea on exertion or at rest, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, and syncope or near-syncope. However, the majority of patients who have significant rejection detected on routine, protocol-mandated biopsy are asymptomatic. The presence of left ventricular dysfunction can be confirmed by echocardiography, which may reveal an acute decrement in systolic function or, less easily detected, a demonstrable worsening of diastolic function. Gastrointestinal symptoms, probably due to secondary hepatic congestion resulting from the increase in central venous pressure, can also be prominent and, in some cases, lead to a delay in diagnosis as other causes of gastrointestinal symptoms are pursued.</p><p>Infrequently, acute cellular rejection presents with atrial arrhythmias, including atrial premature depolarizations, atrial fibrillation, or atrial flutter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Fever and a reduction in QRS voltage on ECG, which were diagnostic features of acute cellular rejection in the first decade of heart transplantation, are rare in the calcineurin inhibitor era [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of acute cellular rejection is established by endomyocardial biopsy, which is performed as part of routine surveillance or, on occasion, because of suggestive symptoms or echocardiographic evidence of new left ventricular dysfunction. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Surveillance biopsy schedule</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surveillance endomyocardial biopsies are performed most frequently in the first three to six months after transplantation, the time at which acute cellular rejection is most common. Late biopsies continue to detect clinically significant episodes of rejection five years after transplantation (grade 3A or greater in 8 of 77 patients in one report), and the absence of early rejection does not predict freedom from late rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The following represents a typical biopsy schedule:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Every week for the first four weeks</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Every two weeks for the next six weeks</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monthly for the next three to four months</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Every three months until the end of the first year</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Three to four times per year in the second year</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One to two times per year in subsequent years</p><p/><p>The above schedule may be modified during an attempt to wean a patient from steroids, or to make significant changes in maintenance immunosuppression. In addition, follow-up biopsies are usually obtained one to two weeks after an episode of cellular rejection is treated to assess the adequacy of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>However, the utility of continued biopsy surveillance in clinically stable patients over the long term (eg, more than one to two years post-transplant) has become controversial. A study of the Cardiac Transplant Research Database found no benefits from surveillance biopsy beyond five years post-transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Evidence from the IMAGE study of subjects six months to five years post-transplant indicates that even if rejection is not identified until graft dysfunction occurs, intermediate-term outcomes may not be worse than with earlier detection of rejection. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Gene expression profiling'</a> below.)</p><p>Alternatives to surveillance biopsies have been investigated including monitoring using a gene-expression profiling test. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Gene expression profiling'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Biopsy procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endomyocardial biopsies are generally performed in a specialized facility, either a cardiac catheterization laboratory or a special biopsy suite. Access is obtained through the right internal jugular vein or, less commonly, through a femoral vein. A specialized cardiac bioptome, which appears similar to bronchoscopic bioptomes, is then guided down the superior vena cava and across the right atrium and tricuspid valve into the right ventricle (using fluoroscopy or occasionally echocardiography). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endomyocardial-biopsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endomyocardial biopsy&quot;</a>.) </p><p>A minimum of three and preferably four or more evaluable specimens of endomyocardial tissue containing at least 50 percent myocardium are obtained from the right ventricular septum and submitted for pathologic assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Most of the biopsy specimens are fixed immediately in 10 percent buffered formalin for light microscopy; tissue can also be frozen for immunohistochemical studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The potential complications of endomyocardial biopsy are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endomyocardial-biopsy#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endomyocardial biopsy&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a>.)</p><p>A complication that is relatively unique to cardiac transplant recipients, presumably because of the performance of biopsies in which the bioptome is repeatedly passed across the tricuspid valve, is tricuspid regurgitation (TR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The reported prevalence of TR ranges from 47 to 98 percent and is moderate to severe in as many as one-third of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p>Severe TR is most often due to a flail leaflet, which probably reflects injury to the tricuspid chordae by the bioptome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Other factors that may contribute include distortion of the tricuspid valve ring due to size mismatch between the donor and recipient, and pulmonary hypertension after transplantation.</p><p>The TR is usually well tolerated but valve replacement is occasionally required. In a review of 17 such patients in the Utah program (2 percent of all cardiac transplants), the average time to valve replacement was 77 months after transplantation and the average number of biopsies before the diagnosis of severe TR was 33 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Histologic findings of acute rejection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute cellular rejection is diagnosed by light microscopy of hematoxylin and eosin stained specimens on endomyocardial tissue. Morphologically, acute cellular rejection is manifested as a mononuclear inflammatory response, predominantly lymphocytic, that is infiltrating the myocardium. In more severe cases, granulocytes are also seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Significant grades of rejection are also accompanied by evidence of cardiac myocyte injury or necrosis. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'ISHLT grading system'</a> below.)</p><p>Immunohistologic assessment shows that the infiltrating mononuclear cells are predominantly T lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. These cells are CD4 and CD8 positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] and express high affinity interleukin-2 receptors on their surfaces. Rejection also induces increased expression of MHC class II molecules and intercellular adhesion molecules on the surfaces of cardiac myocytes and endothelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p>Occasional patients have hemodynamically significant rejection with little or no cellular infiltrate or myocyte necrosis apparent in the biopsy specimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. These patients may have humoral (antibody-mediated) rejection, which is associated with antibody deposition that can be detected by immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy. A formalized description of humoral rejection has been agreed upon by the transplant community [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Acute antibody-mediated (humoral) rejection'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">ISHLT grading system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiac transplant biopsies have been graded for acute cellular rejection according to the standardized International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) nomenclature, which was introduced in 1990 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>] and revised in 2004 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, sampling error associated with endomyocardial biopsy may result in underestimation of the severity of rejection. As a result, the absence of pathologic evidence for severe rejection in the presence of unexplained left ventricular dysfunction, heart failure, or shock should not deter treatment for rejection.

This lack of consistency as well as the costs and potential of morbidity of the biopsy procedure have motivated the search for alternative methods to detect rejection.

The 2004 ISHLT revision included the following biopsy findings of nonrejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ischemic injury &mdash; early (up to six weeks post-transplant); and late (related to allograft coronary disease)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quilty effect</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymphoproliferative disorder</p><p/><p>Perioperative ischemic damage can cause myocardial necrosis as a result of donor trauma with catecholamine excess, pressor therapy during acute care, ex vivo organ ischemia, or reperfusion injury. The histologic appearance of ischemic damage early after transplant usually includes myocyte necrosis out of proportion to the cellular infiltrate, which is predominantly polymorphonuclear rather than mononuclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Later ischemic injury is related to allograft coronary disease, which is also called transplant vasculopathy.

Quilty lesions differ from rejection in two respects: They extend to the endocardial surface of the heart, and they include a substantial proportion of B lymphocytes. Quilty lesions are felt to have no clinical significance.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Opportunistic infections such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Toxoplasma myocarditis can produce lymphocytic infiltration in the allograft myocardium.

In a review of 587 patients at a single center, 19 percent of rejection episodes were due to AMR or vascular rejection alone, 60 percent to cellular rejection (AMR) alone, and 23 percent to mixed cellular and AMR rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>AMR may occur during the first month after transplantation, in association with antidonor antibodies, and can occur as early as two to seven days if the recipient is presensitized to donor HLA antigens, or may occur as late as months to years after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/36,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,38</a>]. Graft dysfunction is present in two-thirds of early episodes, with hemodynamic compromise (shock, hypotension, decreased cardiac output, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a rise pulmonary capillary wedge pressure) in approximately one-half [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/36,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,39</a>].

The test correctly identified 84 percent of moderate to severe rejection. Patients with a score &lt;30 at more than one year post-transplant were highly unlikely to have moderate to severe rejection (negative predictive value 99.6 percent). Although evidence is preliminary, this assay has been adopted clinically by several cardiac transplant programs, primarily for patients beyond the first 6 to 12 months after transplantation.</p><p>The Invasive Monitoring Attenuation through Gene Expression (IMAGE) trial was performed as a noninferiority comparison between a commercially available gene-expression profiling test and routine biopsies for a composite primary outcome of rejection with hemodynamic compromise, graft dysfunction due to other causes, death, or retransplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. The 602 patients were enrolled six months to five years following transplantation. A mandatory biopsy was performed for a gene-expression test score of 30 (increased to a threshold of 34 mid-trial). There was no significant difference in two-year cumulative rates of the composite outcome between the gene-expression profiling and routine biopsy groups (14.5 and 15.3 percent; hazard ratio 1.04, 95% CI 0.67-1.68). However this result is consistent with as high as a 68 percent increase in risk using the gene-expression profiling strategy.</p><p>Fewer treated episodes of rejection occurred in the gene-profiling group than in the routine biopsy group (34 versus 47). Only six of 34 rejection episodes identified in the gene-profiling group were detected on the basis of the profiling test since the others were detected by heart failure symptoms or echocardiographic evidence of graft dysfunction. In the routine biopsy group, 22 of 47 rejection episodes were asymptomatic. These observations may have broader implications for post-transplant surveillance since they indicate that outcomes may not be worse if rejection is detected with graft dysfunction rather than detected early.</p><p>One criticism of the IMAGE study was that it only enrolled patients beyond six months after transplant and that 85 percent of the participants were one year or more post-transplant while acute cellular rejection occurs mainly within the first six months after transplant. E-IMAGE (Early IMAGE) is a single center that randomized 60 transplant patients from two months after transplant to either gene expression profiling or biopsy guided therapy (30 patients in each group) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. It too was a noninferiority comparison with the same primary composite end point as the original IMAGE trial. E-IMAGE also showed no difference in the composite end point, the detection of rejection, or cardiac function between the two groups. As opposed to IMAGE, this study also included intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS) at baseline and one year after transplant and showed no difference in IVUS markers of cardiac allograft vasculopathy between the two groups. The results of E-IMAGE would suggest that gene expression profiling can be used safely in the early (two months and beyond) post-transplant period. </p><p>Further evidence will be needed to determine the utility of this molecular diagnostic assay as a replacement for routine biopsies and its potential role in weaning immunosuppression and other aspects of long-term management of cardiac transplant recipients.</p><p>Another approach to the noninvasive diagnosis of acute cellular rejection is the assessment of the percentage of donor-derived cell-free DNA in the peripheral blood. Quantification of cell-free DNA has already been used clinically for the prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>] and has been applied as a research tool to develop a &ldquo;liquid biopsy&rdquo; for the detection of metastatic cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. In cardiac transplant recipients, a rise in peripheral blood donor-derived cell-free DNA was shown to occur after graft injury from acute cellular rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. In a prospective study, donor-derived cell-free DNA rose in peripheral blood in 44 adult and 21 pediatric heart transplant recipients at the time of ISHLT Grade 2R acute cellular rejection or ISHLT Grade 2 antibody-mediated rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. A group using a somewhat different approach to donor-derived cell-free DNA quantification in the peripheral blood noninvasively detected allograft damage from acute cellular rejection and from cardiac allograft vasculopathy in 26 heart transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Further research is needed to determine the utility of quantification of donor-derived cell-free DNA in the peripheral blood as a noninvasive diagnostic technique for detecting acute cellular rejection and other forms of cardiac allograft injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1940177919\"><span class=\"h2\">Molecular microscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A study of investigational gene expression profiling of endomyocardial biopsies from heart transplant patients compared 55 patients with antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) with a matched group of 55 patients without AMR and also evaluated a validation cohort of 27 cases of AMR and 71 controls. AMR was found to have a distinct molecular signature characterized by endothelial activation, microcirculatory inflammation from macrophages, and natural killer (NK) cells. These gene transcripts could distinguish AMR from its absence in endomyocardial biopsies and may shed light on AMR pathogenesis. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy correlated with endomyocardial biopsy transcripts of endothelial activation, interferon-gamma, and NK cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

Acute cellular rejection can cause graft dysfunction and contributes to approximately 11 percent of deaths in the first three years after transplantation. Acute antibody-mediated rejection may also occur but its impact on morbidity and mortality is less well defined. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Incidence and outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors for acute cellular rejection include younger recipient, female recipient, female donor, black recipient, and greater HLA mismatches between the donor and recipient. The combination of maintenance <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil is associated with higher rates of acute rejection than the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> with mycophenolate mofetil, although a causal relationship has not been established. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When transplant recipients are monitored with a typical surveillance endomyocardial biopsy schedule, most cases of acute cellular rejection are asymptomatic and detected initially by biopsy. Surveillance endocardial biopsies are performed most frequently during the first three to six months with fewer biopsies typically performed after the first year. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Surveillance biopsy schedule'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms of acute rejection include symptoms of graft dysfunction including dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or near-syncope, and symptoms of hepatic congestion. Atrial arrhythmias are less frequent symptoms of acute rejection. Fever and decrease in ECG voltage are rare. Echocardiographic evidence of acute rejection includes worsening systolic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diastolic function. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute cellular rejection is graded according to the histologic appearance of endomyocardial biopsy specimen. False negative results can occur due to sampling error. Evidence of rejection should be distinguished from nonrejection alterations. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Histologic findings of acute rejection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'ISHLT grading system'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several noninvasive markers of acute cellular rejection have been investigated. Of these noninvasive tests, gene expression profiling is supported by the strongest evidence. A clinical trial indicated that gene expression profiling may be noninferior to routine surveillance biopsies. Further study is needed to establish the efficacy of this approach. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Noninvasive detection of rejection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibody mediated rejection, usually due to development of donor specific anti-HLA antibodies, can occur at any time. It is commonly accompanied by hemodynamic compromise when it occurs in the early post-transplant period. It can be diagnosed on endomyocardial biopsy and confirmed by detection of donor specific antibodies.
