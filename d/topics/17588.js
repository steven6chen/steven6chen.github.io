There is considerable overlap between AD and VaD with regard to comorbidity as well as shared risk factors and even pathogenesis. The combination of pathologies may be more common than either in isolation, and it is not generally easy to identify the primary etiologic entity.</p><p>Preventative agents and treatments for VaD have at least potential overlap. The same agent could both prevent the development of VaD in patients at risk and prevent cognitive decline in patients with VaD or in earlier stages of cognitive impairment.</p><p>This topic will review the treatment, prevention, and prognosis of VaD. Other aspects of this disorder are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-vascular-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of vascular dementia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTOR MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with cognitive impairment and clinical or radiologic evidence of cerebrovascular pathology should be screened and treated for vascular risk factors, especially hypertension. Although these measures may be more helpful in preventing rather than ameliorating dementia, there is a strong rationale for aggressive secondary stroke prevention measures in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-vascular-dementia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Recurrent stroke is associated with greater risk of cognitive decline, and poststroke dementia is associated with higher mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-vascular-dementia/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>Based on the observed prevalence of potentially modifiable risk factors (eg, hypertension, diabetes, inactivity) combined with their associated relative risk for dementia, it has been estimated that risk factor reductions of 10 to 25 percent could prevent up to half of dementia cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-vascular-dementia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Although population-based data are not entirely consistent and do not establish causality, it does appear that the incidence of all-cause dementia, and especially vascular dementia, is declining in high-income countries over the past several decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-vascular-dementia/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>].</p><p>This trend has occurred as the prevalence of many vascular risk factors has also decreased over time. As an example, using data from 5205 patients enrolled in the Framingham Heart Study and under surveillance for dementia since 1975, the five-year cumulative hazard rate for dementia fell from 3.6 per 100 persons during the late 1970s to 2.0 per 100 persons in the late 2000&rsquo;s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-vascular-dementia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The decline was only observed among individuals with at least a high school diploma and was of greater magnitude for vascular dementia than for Alzheimer disease. Rates of hypertension, heart disease, and stroke declined over the same time period, while rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes rose.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Antihypertensive drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While blood pressure lowering is generally recommended for hypertensive individuals because of its compelling benefit for the reduction of mortality and cardiovascular events, randomized, controlled studies and meta-analyses have yielded conflicting data regarding the effect of antihypertensive therapy on incident dementia in general [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-vascular-dementia/abstract/11-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hypertension-in-adults#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-dementia#H727955342\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of dementia&quot;, section on 'Antihypertensive therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Blood pressure lowering strategies have not been specifically tested for treatment or prevention of vascular dementia (VaD). Moreover, there is some concern that aggressive lowering of blood pressure could potentially compromise cerebral perfusion and actually may be deleterious in patients with established cerebrovascular disease. Studies have provided conflicting results regarding a possible association between hypotension and impaired cognition and incident dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-vascular-dementia/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>].</p><p>Further studies are needed to define the optimal blood pressure targets in patients who have and who may be at risk for vascular dementia. The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) found that intensive blood pressure lowering (goal <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;120/90</span> mm Hg) improved mortality and composite cardiovascular outcomes compared with standard treatment (goal <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;140/90</span> mm Hg), but rates of stroke were similar between groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-vascular-dementia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Cognitive outcomes were assessed during the trial but results have not yet been presented. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-is-goal-blood-pressure-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;What is goal blood pressure in the treatment of hypertension?&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A consensus-based scientific review by the American Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/American</span> Stroke Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(AHA/ASA)</span> states that blood pressure lowering to lower the risk of post-stroke dementia is effective and that it is reasonable to lower blood pressure in mid-life to lower the risk of late-life dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-vascular-dementia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The review cautions that less is known about the effects of blood pressure lowering among those older than 80 years of age.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Diabetes management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies assessing treatment of diabetes mellitus in relation to cognitive function or dementia are limited. Mixed results from several small trials with methodological problems such as open-label design, subjective cognitive measures, and lack of baseline function suggest the need for larger trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-vascular-dementia/abstract/27-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-31</a>].The <span class=\"nowrap\">AHA/ASA</span> states that treatment of hyperglycemia and diabetes for the prevention of dementia is not well established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-vascular-dementia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>While unproven in the treatment or prevention of vascular dementia, tighter glucose control is generally recommended for the prevention of complications associated with diabetes. A randomized trial comparing two oral antidiabetic agents in 156 older patients with diabetes found that higher postprandial plasma glucose excursions (less tight diabetes control) were associated with greater declines in cognitive performance measures over one year of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-vascular-dementia/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In another trial, even a one percent higher A1C value was significantly associated with poorer cognitive performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-vascular-dementia/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. However, most data on the effects of hyperglycemia on cognitive outcomes come from observational studies, and data from randomized trials is limited. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Statins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Statin drugs are of interest in the prevention of cerebrovascular disease both because of their lipid lowering effect and also their pleiotropic effects on vascular function, combining to inhibit atherosclerosis. Their effect on incident dementia is uncertain, however [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-vascular-dementia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>A population-based nested case-control study revealed a substantively lowered risk of dementia among patients treated with statin therapies but did not distinguish between types of dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-vascular-dementia/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In another nonrandomized cohort, patients on statins did not have a lower risk of VaD compared with patients not on statins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-vascular-dementia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Randomized controlled clinical trials of cholesterol lowering have not shown a reduction in the incidence of cognitive decline or dementia in patients on statins, but they were probably underpowered to show this effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-vascular-dementia/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Antiplatelet agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While of established efficacy in secondary stroke prevention, no randomized trials have found a benefit for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> or other antiplatelet therapy in the prevention or treatment of VaD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-vascular-dementia/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The Aspirin for Asymptomatic Atherosclerosis (AAA) trial randomly assigned 3350 participants (50 to 75 years) to aspirin or placebo, but after five years of follow-up, there was no difference in cognitive test scores between the groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-vascular-dementia/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Other trials comparing antiplatelet agents to each other have also found no benefit on cognitive function or recurrent lacunar stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-vascular-dementia/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Homocysteine lowering</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elevated homocysteine is an independent risk factor for vascular disease and may also be associated with risk of dementia.

In one small randomized trial, a six-month, three days per week aerobic exercise training program improved short-term cognitive performance compared with an educational control group, but differences in cognitive outcomes did not persist when participants were retested six months later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-vascular-dementia/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1939405164\"><span class=\"h2\">Multimodality interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A few studies have examined the effects of programs that target all aspects of vascular risk factor reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-vascular-dementia/abstract/49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-51</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the largest trial, 116 general medical practices in the Netherlands (3526 patients aged 70 to 78 years) were randomly assigned to usual care or a six-year multidomain cardiovascular intervention consisting of nursing visits every four months for assessment and treatment of smoking habits, diet, physical activity, weight, and blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-vascular-dementia/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. After a median follow up of 6.7 years, the rate of all-cause dementia was 7 percent in both groups; all other outcomes were similar as well, including mean disability scores and incident cardiovascular disease. Subgroup analysis suggested a possible benefit in the outcome of non-AD dementia (hazard ratio 0.37, 95% CI 0.18&ndash;0.76), although the number of cases was small (n = 34).

Other agents with mixed but overall negative results in VaD trials include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nicardipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nicardipine</a> and cyclandelate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-vascular-dementia/abstract/80,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,81</a>].</p><p>Actovegin, a deproteinized calf blood hemodialysate licensed in some countries in Europe and Asia, showed possible benefit for hastening recovery of post-stroke cognitive impairment in a randomized trial of 503 patients enrolled within one week of ischemic stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-vascular-dementia/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. At six months, Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale extended version (ADAS-cog+) scores improved more in the Actovegin group than in the placebo group (between-group difference 2.3 points, 95% CI 0.7-3.9), but the magnitude was below the four-point difference that investigators prespecified as representing a clinically important effect. In addition, recurrent ischemic stroke occurred more often in the Actovegin group, although the difference was not statistically significant (5.2 versus 2 percent; OR 2.09, 95% CI 0.83-5.26). Given modest benefits and potential harms, more studies are needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF BEHAVIORAL SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other categories of treatment include the treatment of behavioral and emotional problems related to vascular dementia (VaD).

However, fluctuations in symptoms, with periods of improvement, may occur in some affected individuals. In one clinical trial the presence of hippocampal atrophy on MRI predicted the course of cognitive change; patients in the placebo group experienced overall cognitive decline in the presence of hippocampal atrophy, and cognitive stability when hippocampal atrophy was not present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-vascular-dementia/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].

Also, many studies are hospital or clinic based, resulting in referral bias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-vascular-dementia/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].
