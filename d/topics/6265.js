The number of patients enrolled in the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) Medicare-funded program has increased from approximately 10,000 beneficiaries in 1973 to 661,648 as of 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Although the exact reasons for the growth of the ESRD program are unknown, changes in the demographics of the population, differences in disease burden among racial groups, and under-recognition of earlier stages of CKD and of risk factors for CKD may partially explain this growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>].</p><p>Patients with ESRD consume a disproportionate share of health care resources.</p><p>However, despite the magnitude of the resources committed to the treatment of ESRD and the substantial improvements in the quality of dialysis therapy, these patients continue to experience significant mortality and morbidity and a reduced quality of life.</p><p>This topic reviews the epidemiology of CKD and its associated morbidity and mortality. Overviews of the management of CKD, its complications, and screening recommendations are discussed separately.

Such abnormalities may include one or more markers of kidney damage (eg, albuminuria &gt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g</span> of creatinine, urine sediment abnormalities, electrolyte and other abnormalities due to tubular disorders, abnormalities detected by histology, structural abnormalities detected by imaging, or history of kidney transplantation) or the presence of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> (GFR categories 3a to 5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Formulas that utilize easily obtained values have been developed that help estimate the GFR. These include the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) and CKD Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-kidney-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of kidney function&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The CKD Guidelines workgroup decided to classify CKD as a GFR &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> or as the presence of a marker of kidney damage. Using a GFR of &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> as a definition for CKD, the prevalence is 4.7 percent or 8.3 million.</p><p>Based upon these definitions, the following was the recommended classification of CKD by stage and the estimated prevalence within the United States of each stage, as largely determined by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) performed in 1999 to 2004 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/3,8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8-11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 1 disease is defined by a normal GFR (&gt;90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>) and persistent albuminuria (1.8 percent of the total United States adult population).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 2 disease is a GFR between 60 to 89 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> and persistent albuminuria (3.2 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 3 disease is a GFR between 30 and 59 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> (7.7 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 4 disease is a GFR between 15 and 29 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> (0.35 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 5 disease is a GFR of &lt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> or end-stage renal disease (ESRD; 2.4 percent).</p><p/><p>Since the original Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) classification was published, stage 3 CKD (GFR of 30 to 59 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>) has been subdivided into GFR stages 3a and 3b to more accurately reflect the continuous association between lower GFR and risk for mortality and adverse kidney outcomes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F68921\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68921 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Patients receiving treatment with dialysis are subclassified as GFR stage 5D to highlight the specialized care that they require.

Data from the NHANES database, with GFR estimated with the CKD-EPI equation, showed that the overall prevalence of CKD stages 3 through 4 increased from 4.8 percent (95% CI 4.3-5.4) in 1988 to 1994 to 6.9 percent (95% CI 5.9-7.9) and remained stable after that with prevalence of 6.9 percent (95% CI 5.5-8.3) in 2011 to 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The prevalence was largely unchanged when the definition of CKD was broadened to include individuals with estimated GFR (eGFR) &ge;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> and a one-time demonstration of increased protein excretion (defined by urine albumin to creatinine ratio of &gt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g)</span>.

This has been shown in a variety of studies. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study from Japan calculated the creatinine clearance using the Cockcroft-Gault method among nearly 100,000 subjects &gt;20 years of age who participated in a mass screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Based upon these KDOQI definitions, &gt;80 percent of those &gt;70 years of age would be considered to have at least stage 3 disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A population-based cross-sectional study of &gt;6000 healthy men and women in the Netherlands determined that 42 percent of men and 44 percent of women &gt;85 years of age had an MDRD eGFR &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p>Age- and gender-specific eGFR values may provide a more accurate definition of CKD than KDIGO definitions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The CKD-EPI equation may provide more accurate estimates of the GFR, especially among individuals who have normal or only mildly reduced GFR. Analysis of NHANES data with GFR estimated with the CKD-EPI equation showed that, among individuals ages 65 to 79 years, the prevalence of stage 3 and 4 CKD was 21.7 percent (95% CI 18-25.4) in 2011 to 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This is down from prevalence of 25.1 percent (95% CI 20.7-29.5) in 2003 to 2004.

Albuminuria staging has been added because of the graded increase in risk for mortality, progression of CKD, and ESRD at higher levels of albuminuria, independent of eGFR, without an apparent threshold value (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F68921\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68921 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F58089\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58089 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The increase in risk is significant for urine ACR values &ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g,</span> even when GFR is &gt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>, consistent with the current threshold value for albuminuria (&ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g)</span> as a marker of kidney damage. An increased risk is also apparent with urine ACR levels between 10 and 29 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g</span> (&quot;high-normal&quot; albuminuria), suggesting that levels &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g</span> may also warrant increased attention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-staging-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults#H27259169\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and staging of chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Albuminuria'</a>.)</p><p>Increased urinary protein excretion is the earliest clinical finding of diabetic nephropathy. Moderately increased albuminuria may also be an early marker for nondiabetic CKD and is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). In some nondiabetics, for example, moderately increased albuminuria may be a general signal via the kidney that the vasculature in general is not functioning normally. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-and-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Moderately increased albuminuria (microalbuminuria) and cardiovascular disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An analysis of NHANES data from 4101 individuals in the years 1999 to 2000 evaluated the prevalence of increased albuminuria alone as a marker of early kidney disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The prevalence of severely increased albuminuria, defined as urine albumin concentration &gt;300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L,</span> was 1.7 and 0.9 percent among males and females, respectively. The overall prevalence of moderately increased albuminuria (defined as urinary ACR &ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g</span> but &lt;300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g)</span> was 8.8 percent and was lower in males (7.3 percent) than females (10.4 percent), which may be explained by the higher average urine creatinine in men compared with women. As expected, there was a higher prevalence of albuminuria among individuals with diabetes. These values are higher than those observed in the years 1988 to 1994, which held generally for gender, age, and <span class=\"nowrap\">race/ethnicity</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The ACR, combined with eGFR, may provide a better predictor of patients at risk for progression to ESRD than eGFR alone. This was shown in an analysis of data from the Nord-Tr&oslash;ndelag Health (HUNT 2) Study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Of 65,589 adults who participated in the study, 124 patients progressed to ESRD after 10 years of follow-up. Both eGFR and albuminuria were independently and strongly associated with progression to ESRD. Combining the <span class=\"nowrap\">albumin/creatinine</span> ratio with the eGFR provided the most discriminating model for predicting progression.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence in other countries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of CKD in countries other than the United States has been reported, although cross-country comparisons are difficult because of variations in study design, differences in definitions used, lack of standardization of laboratory calibrations, and lack of knowledge of significant factors such as age and comorbidity. CKD, most commonly defined as an elevated serum creatinine level or decreased eGFR or moderately increased albuminuria, reportedly ranges from approximately 1 to 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/21-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-30</a>].</p><p>As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a population-based study in Korea, the prevalence of moderately increased albuminuria was 2.8 percent among normotensive, normoglycemic individuals and 10 and 16 percent among hypertensives and diabetics, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

However, the relative risk for progression from CKD stages 3 or 4 to ESRD in US white patients compared with Norwegian patients was 2.5, suggesting that lower progression to ESRD rather than a smaller pool of individuals at risk accounts for the lower incidence of ESRD in Norway.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study of 13 European countries, the adjusted prevalence of CKD 1 to 5 in the general population aged 45 to 74 years ranged from 6.3 percent in Norway to 25.6 percent in Germany.

According to the United States Renal Data System (USRDS), a total of 117,162 ESRD patients began chronic dialysis in the US in 2013, with an adjusted incidence rate of 352 per <span class=\"nowrap\">million/year</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The latter increased sharply in the 1980s and 1990s, leveled off in the early 2000s, and declined slightly since its peak in 2006.

Despite that the number of ESRD incident cases plateaued in 2010, the number of ESRD prevalent cases continues to rise by approximately 21,000 cases per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>The rising prevalence of treated ESRD can be attributed to the increase in the number of patients who start renal replacement therapy (RRT) each year and to the increased survival of patients with ESRD. Since the incidence rates of treated ESRD have flattened in recent years, the longer lifespans of prevalent ESRD patients may partially explain the steady growth of this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>There are a paucity of data concerning the correlation of the change in prevalence (or incidence) of CKD over time with changes in the incidence of ESRD.

As an example, nine new cases of ESRD developed in 1983 for every 1000 patients with CKD in 1978. By comparison, 16 cases of ESRD had developed in 1996 for every 1000 patients with CKD in 1991.

Among individuals without ESRD at age 40 years, the lifetime risk of ESRD was 2.66 percent among men and 1.76 percent among women.

Among individuals with eGFR 60 to 89 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>, the risk was 1.01 and 0.63 percent, respectively.

The estimated number of patients who needed RRT was between 4.902 million (95% CI 4.438-5.431 million) calculated using a conservative model and 9.701 million (95% CI 8.544-11.021 million) using a high-estimate model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. These estimates suggest that at least 2.284 million people might have died prematurely because RRT could not be accessed. The largest treatment gaps occur in low-income countries, particularly Asia and Africa. Worldwide use of RRT is projected to more than double to 5.439 million (95% CI 3.899-7.640 million) people by 2030, with the most growth in Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>According to the USRDS, the highest prevalence of treated ESRD was reported for Taiwan, Japan, and the US, and, in the Chronic Kidney Disease Inventory, the prevalence of treated ESRD was highest in Portugal and lowest in Switzerland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/34,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19652768\"><span class=\"h1\">RACIAL VARIATIONS IN PREVALENCE OF ESRD AND CKD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are striking racial and ethnic differences in the incidence and prevalence rates of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. In 2005, the incidence rates for ESRD in the United States were 268 per million population in Caucasians; 991 in African Americans; 355 in Asian Americans, native Hawaiians, and other Pacific Islanders; and 516 in American Indians and Alaska Natives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Examined by ethnicity, Hispanics had higher incidence rates than non-Hispanics (490 versus 337 per million population). Racial and ethnic differences persist, with 2008 incident rates in the African-American and American-Indian populations 3.6 and 1.8 times greater, respectively, than the rate among whites and the rate in the Hispanic population 1.5 times higher than that of non-Hispanics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Similarly, the incidence of ESRD in South-Asian and African-Caribbean immigrants in the United Kingdom is three- to fourfold higher than in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Analysis of National Health and Nutrition Examination (NHANES) data suggested that, although the prevalence of stage 3 and 4 CKD stabilized among non-Hispanic white persons between 2003 to 2004 and 2011 to 2012, the prevalence among non-Hispanic black persons continued to increase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>There is also significant variability in the causes of ESRD among the various racial and ethnic groups. As an example, whereas diabetic nephropathy is the most common cause of ESRD in all <span class=\"nowrap\">racial/ethnic</span> groups, hypertensive nephropathy is the cause of ESRD in 33 percent of African Americans compared with &lt;25 percent in all other <span class=\"nowrap\">racial/ethnic</span> groups. The age- and gender-adjusted ratio (African American to Caucasian) of hypertensive ESRD is 6:1.</p><p>African Americans and, to a lesser extent, other racial and ethnic minorities have a disproportionately higher incidence rate of ESRD due to diabetes and glomerulonephritis compared with Caucasians. Furthermore, African Americans and Hispanics tend to reach ESRD at a younger age than Caucasians (mean age 57 and 58 years, respectively, compared with 63 years). In the United Kingdom, a similarly increased risk of diabetic nephropathy is seen in the South-Asian population, whereas the African-Caribbean population also has additional susceptibility to kidney damage from hypertension and sickle cell disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Since not all patients with CKD reach ESRD, it is conceivable that the incidence and prevalence rates of earlier stages of CKD among some <span class=\"nowrap\">racial/ethnic</span> groups differ from those observed in ESRD patients. These racial and ethnic disparities are unlikely to be purely due to genetic factors, especially since the two most common causes of ESRD (diabetes and hypertension) are highly modifiable conditions. These disparities raise the possibility that differential access to health care and, thus, management of CKD and probably faster progression to ESRD, may be a cause for concern in minority groups, particularly among African Americans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].</p><p>There are limited data regarding the prevalence of CKD stratified by race and ethnicity:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>From NHANES III data, it was estimated that the prevalence of CKD (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>) was 5, 3.5, and 1 percent among non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among participants in the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES), the prevalence of CKD was 13, 3, and 4 percent among Cuban Americans, Mexican Americans and Puerto Ricans, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a population-based study of the Zuni Indians, the prevalence of albuminuria (urine albumin creatinine ratio [ACR] &ge;0.3) was approximately 20 percent among diabetic patients and &lt;2 percent among nondiabetic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1626413\"><span class=\"h2\">APOL1 in African Americans</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genetic factors underlie, at least in part, the markedly increased risk of ESRD among African Americans. Two separate disease-causing polymorphisms, originally believed to reside in the podocyte nonmuscle myosin IIA (<em>MYH9</em>) gene but now known to be located in the neighboring apolipoprotein L1 (<em>APOL1</em>) gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/54-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-57</a>], follow an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance and confer a substantially higher risk of ESRD (10-fold higher risk of ESRD due to focal glomerulosclerosis and sevenfold higher risk of ESRD attributed to hypertension) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/57-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-61</a>].

In a study of 407 African-American patients receiving hemodialysis, patients with two mutant alleles were significantly younger at the time of dialysis initiation than those without any disease-causing <em>APOL1</em> mutation (49 versus 62 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. In addition, these polymorphisms are associated with earlier stage CKD. In a population-based study that included 1776 African Americans without known kidney disease (mean age 45 years), homozygotes for <em>APOL1</em> mutations were more likely to have moderately increased albuminuria (formerly called &quot;microalbuminuria&quot;; 18 versus 9 percent) and an estimated GFR (eGFR) &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> (6 versus 3 percent) compared with other individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>Among patients who have CKD, high-risk <em>APOL1</em> alleles are associated with more rapid decline in eGFR. In post-hoc analyses of the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) study, 2955 patients (48 percent black and 46 percent with diabetes) were analyzed by race and according to the absence or presence of high-risk <em>APOL1</em> alleles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Over a mean follow-up of 4.4 years, the eGFR declined faster among black patients with a high-risk <em>APOL1</em> allele compared with black patients with a low-risk <em>APOL1</em> allele and compared with white patients. This association was observed among diabetic patients (with declines in eGFR of -4.3 versus -2.7 and -1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> per year, respectively) and nondiabetic patients (-2.9 versus -1.0 versus -0.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> per year, respectively).</p><p><em>APOL1</em> mutations are found exclusively among individuals of African descent and, although speculative, are believed to provide resistance to disease-causing trypanosomes. The functional significance of these gene variants is unclear, but they may lead to diminished expression of <em>APOL1</em> in podocytes and inappropriate expression in renal arterioles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>The association of <em>APOL1</em> polymorphisms with specific renal diseases is discussed separately.
