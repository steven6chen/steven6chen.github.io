This procedure is most commonly performed following cystectomy due to medically refractory invasive bladder cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-complications-following-ureteral-diversion/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Other indications for cystectomy include neurogenic bladder disease due to spinal cord lesions, urinary incontinence, vesicovaginal fistulae, scarring due to infection or chemotherapy, and failed reconstruction after congenital anomalies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-complications-following-ureteral-diversion/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>There are three major forms of urinary diversion performed in patients requiring a cystectomy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-diversion-and-reconstruction-following-cystectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary diversion and reconstruction following cystectomy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radical-cystectomy-and-bladder-sparing-treatments-for-urothelial-bladder-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radical cystectomy and bladder-sparing treatments for urothelial bladder cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laparoscopic-robotic-assisted-radical-cystectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laparoscopic/robotic-assisted radical cystectomy&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ileal conduit &ndash; A non-continent cutaneous diversion in which the urine flows from the ureters through a segment of bowel (usually ileum, termed ileal conduit) to the skin surface as a stoma, where it is collected in an external bag or other appliance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continent cutaneous diversion &ndash; A cutaneous continent reservoir may be constructed to avoid the need for an external appliance (usually using the right colon and terminal ileum).

However, clinicians still encounter patients who have had this procedure.Although infrequent, a segment of bowel can be interposed between the pelvis of the kidney and the bladder.</p><p>These techniques and their complications are discussed elsewhere in detail.

In one series, for example, glomerular filtration rate declined by 15 to 25 percent during a mean of 11 years after the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-complications-following-ureteral-diversion/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The major causes of renal injury in such patients include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reflux nephropathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stenosis of the ureteral-intestinal anastomosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nephrolithiasis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prerenal azotemia</p><p/><p>It is important that continent urinary diversions have low storage and emptying pressures since high pressures can lead to reflux nephropathy and pressure-induced renal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-complications-following-ureteral-diversion/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Reflux of urine into the urinary pelvis can also predispose to ascending urinary tract infections and pyelonephritis, further contributing to progressive loss of renal function.</p><p>To ensure a low pressure system, all bowel segments used for diversion are usually detubularized and then refashioned into a more spherical shape. This maneuver allows for greater holding capacity and reduced luminal pressures compared with unaltered segments. Detubularization is not required, however, if a ureterosigmoidostomy is performed, because the sigmoid colon has a large capacity and is therefore an inherently low pressure system. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-diversion-and-reconstruction-following-cystectomy#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary diversion and reconstruction following cystectomy&quot;, section on 'Continent cutaneous diversions'</a>.)</p><p>In addition to reflux nephropathy, stenosis of the ureteral-intestinal (or intestinal-cutaneous) anastomosis and nephrolithiasis may cause urinary obstruction resulting in renal function decline.</p><p>Prerenal kidney dysfunction may develop because some patients who undergo extensive resection of the terminal ileum during ileal conduit creation can develop diarrhea due to malabsorption of bile salts and fat as well as bacterial overgrowth. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-diversion-and-reconstruction-following-cystectomy#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary diversion and reconstruction following cystectomy&quot;, section on 'Nutritional and metabolic abnormalities'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H548816994\"><span class=\"h1\">NEPHROLITHIASIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with urinary diversion are at increased risk for development of upper tract calculi, particularly those composed of struvite. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-struvite-stones\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of struvite stones&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Important risk factors for this complication are chronic bacteriuria with urease-producing organisms and upper urinary tract dilatation associated with urinary stasis. The maintenance of sterile urine is important in minimizing the risk of stones in these patients. In high-risk patients, antibiotic prophylaxis and vigilant surveillance may be warranted. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of struvite or staghorn calculi&quot;, section on 'Treatment options'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4939831\"><span class=\"h1\">METABOLIC DISTURBANCES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The nature and severity of metabolic disturbances are primarily a function of the duration of contact time between the urine and bowel, the total surface area of bowel exposed to urine, and the anatomic origin of the bowel segment utilized for the anastomosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4939837\"><span class=\"h2\">Metabolic acidosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A hyperchloremic (normal anion gap) metabolic acidosis develops in up to 80 percent of patients who undergo ureterosigmoidostomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-complications-following-ureteral-diversion/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. In such patients, urine is exposed to an extensive surface area of colonic mucosa for a prolonged period of time. The colon has an abundant luminal anion exchanger (SLC26A3) that absorbs chloride and secretes bicarbonate. Thus, when chloride-rich urine enters the colon, the chloride is absorbed in exchange for bicarbonate, resulting in &quot;inappropriate&quot; bicarbonate loss, and chloride retention.</p><p>Metabolism of urinary urea by intestinal bacteria is another potential mechanism for metabolic acidosis in patients with a ureterosigmoidostomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-complications-following-ureteral-diversion/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Urea delivered to the colon is metabolized to ammonium and bicarbonate. Bicarbonate generated from urea may be excreted unchanged in the stool, or it may react with organic acids such as lactate or butyrate, and those anions are excreted instead of bicarbonate. Intestinal absorption of the ammonium ions, either in exchange for sodium or together with chloride, represents an acid load. The absorbed ammonium ions are transported via the portal circulation to the liver where they are metabolized to urea. This process generates hydrogen ions. The net effect is the loss of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> or the addition of hydrochloric acid to body fluids.</p><p>Metabolic acidosis is much less likely to develop in patients who have a well-functioning ileal conduit. Rapid drainage of urine into an external collection bag limits the contact time between the urine and intestinal mucosa, thereby preventing significant changes in urinary composition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-complications-following-ureteral-diversion/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>]. However, metabolic acidosis can develop if contact time is increased due to malfunction of the loop (most often the result of a stomal [anastomotic] stenosis). Thus, a loopogram should be performed when an otherwise unexplained metabolic acidosis develops in a patient with an ileal conduit. When acidosis occurs in such patients, ileal absorption of urinary ammonium may be a more important mechanism of metabolic acidosis than chloride-bicarbonate exchange [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-complications-following-ureteral-diversion/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1209772466\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypokalemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypokalemia is common with ureterosigmoidostomy and sigmoid loop bladders, although the mechanism is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-complications-following-ureteral-diversion/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Hypokalemia is less common with ileal as compared with sigmoid diversions, perhaps because the sigmoid secretes potassium while the ileum does not.</p><p>Hypokalemia may also result from renal losses. First, systemic acidosis can lead to renal potassium wasting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-complications-following-ureteral-diversion/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Metabolic acidosis is associated with decreased net proximal Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-complications-following-ureteral-diversion/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. The subsequent increase in distal delivery leads to volume contraction and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may also be activated by the &quot;inappropriate&quot; loss of HCO<sub>3</sub> salts generated by the intestinal segment. The combination of increased distal Na<sup>+</sup> delivery and aldosterone increases renal K<sup>+</sup> excretion.</p><p>The metabolic acidosis associated with a ureteral diversion can usually be corrected by the administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> or potential bicarbonate such as sodium citrate. However, if patients have severe potassium deficits, it is important that the potassium replacement be initiated before the administration of any bicarbonate salts. Otherwise, correction of the acidosis can further reduce the serum potassium concentration to dangerous levels.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4939843\"><span class=\"h2\">Hyperammonemic encephalopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperammonemic encephalopathy is an unusual complication of ureteral diversion that typically develops in patients who also have chronic liver disease or acute hepatic dysfunction. In such patients, the ammonia that is derived from intestinal metabolism of urine urea and then absorbed cannot be metabolized rapidly enough to prevent hyperammonemia and encephalopathy.</p><p>Urinary obstruction may exacerbate hyperammonemia by increasing exposure time of the urine with intestinal mucosa. In addition, urinary infection caused by bacteria that hydrolyze urea to ammonium, such as Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella oxytoca, can also increase ammonia levels, even in the absence of liver dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-complications-following-ureteral-diversion/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Thus, patients with a ureteral diversion who develop hyperammonemic encephalopathy should be evaluated and, if necessary, treated for acute or chronic liver disease, urinary tract obstruction, and urinary tract infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4939855\"><span class=\"h2\">Hyperkalemia and hyponatremia with ureterojejunostomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anastomosis of the ureter to a segment of jejunum can lead to hyperkalemia since the jejunum normally reabsorbs potassium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-complications-following-ureteral-diversion/abstract/5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8</a>]. This complication developed in a 77-year-old man undergoing extensive pelvic surgery for treatment of rectal carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-complications-following-ureteral-diversion/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Due to the presence of multiple pelvic adhesions, the ureters were inadvertently diverted into a section of the jejunum. Upon institution of enteral feedings containing a high-potassium content, the patient quickly developed hyperkalemia.</p><p>The jejunum also avidly absorbs electrolyte-free water, which can lead to hyponatremia in patients who drink large amounts of water. Although the urine excreted by the kidney may be dilute, as it passes through the jejunum, urinary osmolality rises to the level of plasma osmolality because electrolyte-free water is absorbed by the bowel mucosa.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4939861\"><span class=\"h2\">Metabolic alkalosis with gastrocystoplasty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastric acid loss leading to a metabolic alkalosis can result from gastrocystoplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-complications-following-ureteral-diversion/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Although not commonly performed, this procedure involves implantation of a gastric patch onto the bladder. The gastric mucosa retains its normal secretory function and, depending upon the patch size, can produce significant acid loss from the body into the urine. Exposure of the gastric patch to an alkaline urine increases gastrin secretion, as does mechanical stretch of the patch. Gastrin production in turn stimulates hydrogen ion secretion. Thus, serum gastrin and serum bicarbonate concentrations are correlated in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-complications-following-ureteral-diversion/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Acid secretion by the gastric patch can be minimized with administration of a proton-pump inhibitor.</p><p>In some patients, the markedly acid urine can damage the remaining bladder mucosa, resulting in dysuria and hematuria. Another long-term complication of gastric patch bladder augmentation procedures is an increased risk of malignancy in the gastric patch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-complications-following-ureteral-diversion/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4939867\"><span class=\"h2\">Effects on mineral metabolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with chronic metabolic acidosis, some of the retained acid is buffered in bone, resulting in the release of bone calcium.
