It typically leads to deformity through the stretching of tendons and ligaments and destruction of joints through the erosion of cartilage and bone. If it is untreated or unresponsive to therapy, inflammation and joint destruction lead to loss of physical function, inability to carry out daily tasks of living, and difficulties in maintaining employment.</p><p>Early recognition and treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) is important in achieving control of disease and prevention of joint injury and disability. However, in patients with early disease, the joint manifestations are often difficult to distinguish from other forms of inflammatory polyarthritis. The more distinctive signs of RA, such as joint erosions, rheumatoid nodules, and other extraarticular manifestations, are seen primarily in patients with longstanding, poorly controlled disease but are frequently absent on initial presentation.</p><p>This topic will review the approach to the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of RA. The clinical features of this disorder, its extraarticular manifestations, and laboratory markers that are clinically useful in the diagnosis of RA are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-systemic-and-nonarticular-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the systemic and nonarticular manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biologic-markers-in-the-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biologic markers in the diagnosis and assessment of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8594869\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION FOR SUSPECTED RA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) should be suspected in the adult patient who presents with inflammatory polyarthritis. The initial evaluation of such patients requires a careful history and physical examination, along with selected laboratory testing to identify features that are characteristic of RA or that suggest an alternative diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>We focus especially on the following for the purposes of diagnosis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We perform a thorough medical history, with particular attention to joint pain, reported swelling, and the presence, location (peripheral joints rather than low back), and duration (at least 30 minutes) of morning stiffness. The absence of other conditions or symptoms suggesting an alternative diagnosis, such as psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), or a systemic rheumatic disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), helps to exclude other disorders.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Symptoms of arthritis that have been present for a short time (for example, less than six weeks) may well be due to an acute viral polyarthritis rather than to RA. The longer symptoms persist, the more likely the diagnosis of RA becomes. Thus, in patients presenting very early, close observation with frequent follow-up appointments is required, with repeated serologic analysis for anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies, rheumatoid factor (RF), and acute phase reactants. In a minority of patients, several such visits are required before the differential diagnosis between RA and viral arthritis becomes established. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Typical 'classic' RA'</a> and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A complete physical examination is indicated to assess for synovitis, including the presence and distribution of swollen or tender joints and limited joint motion; extraarticular disease manifestations, such as rheumatoid nodules; and signs of diseases, such as SLE or psoriasis, included in the differential diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Symptoms and physical findings'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rheumatoid-nodules\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rheumatoid nodules&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We perform the following laboratory tests, which support the diagnosis if positive <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> elevated:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>RF and anti-CCP antibodies &ndash; We perform both RF and anti-CCP antibody testing when initially evaluating a patient with suspected RA. The results of both tests are informative, since a positive result for either test increases overall diagnostic sensitivity, while the specificity is increased when both tests are positive. Despite this, both tests are negative on presentation in up to 50 percent of patients and remain negative during follow-up in 20 percent of patients with RA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biologic-markers-in-the-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biologic markers in the diagnosis and assessment of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Rheumatoid factors'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biologic-markers-in-the-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biologic markers in the diagnosis and assessment of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels &ndash; Both the ESR and CRP are typically elevated in RA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biologic-markers-in-the-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biologic markers in the diagnosis and assessment of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Erythrocyte sedimentation rate'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biologic-markers-in-the-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biologic markers in the diagnosis and assessment of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'C-reactive protein'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We perform the following testing in all patients, which may be helpful in the differential diagnosis of RA and as baseline testing for monitoring of disease activity or progression and medication safety:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing &ndash; A negative ANA helps exclude SLE and other systemic rheumatic diseases; the ANA may be positive in up to one-third of patients with RA. In patients with a positive ANA, anti-double stranded DNA and anti-Smith antibody testing should also be performed; these antibodies have high specificity for SLE. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-and-clinical-significance-of-antinuclear-antibodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement and clinical significance of antinuclear antibodies&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Complete blood count (CBC) with differential and platelet count, tests of liver and kidney function, serum uric acid, and a urinalysis &ndash; The CBC is often abnormal in RA, with anemia and thrombocytosis consistent with chronic inflammation. Liver and kidney testing abnormalities indicate a disorder other than RA; if caused by comorbid conditions, they may affect therapeutic choices or drug dosing. Hyperuricemia may prompt additional efforts, including arthrocentesis and crystal search, to exclude gout; polyarticular gout can infrequently be mistaken for RA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematologic-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematologic manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Anemia of chronic disease'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematologic-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematologic manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Platelet abnormalities'</a> and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Radiographs of the hands, wrists, and feet &ndash; We obtain radiographs during the initial evaluation primarily as a baseline for monitoring disease progression. However, characteristic joint erosions may be observed in patients presenting with symptoms for the first time and, hence, aid in diagnosis. Additionally, in patients with other disorders, such as psoriatic arthritis, spondyloarthropathy, gout, or chondrocalcinosis, radiographic changes more characteristic of these conditions may point to an alternative diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H12499388\" class=\"local\">'2010 ACR/EULAR criteria'</a> below and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis#H1597644\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Imaging'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We perform the following studies in selected patients:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Serologic studies for infection &ndash; In patients with a very short history (for example, less than six weeks) particularly those who are seronegative for anti-CCP and RF, we perform serologic testing for human parvovirus B19, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV). In areas endemic for Lyme disease, we perform serologic studies for Borrelia as well. In people who live in or have traveled to parts of the world where mosquito (<em>Aedes aegypti</em> and <em>Aedes albopictus)</em>-bite transmitted viral diseases are prevalent, chikungunya virus infection should be suspected in patients with fever and arthralgia, as this may be followed by a chronic polyarthritis; diagnosis is confirmed by serologic tests.

Synovial fluid testing should include a cell count and differential, crystal search, and Gram stain and culture. Synovial fluid analysis should also be obtained to exclude infection or crystalline arthropathy in patients who undergo glucocorticoid injections for symptomatic relief. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis#H1597589\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Laboratory findings'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=synovial-fluid-analysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Synovial fluid analysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound &ndash; MRI studies and ultrasonography do not have an established role in the routine evaluation of patients with polyarthritis. However, MRI and ultrasound are more sensitive than radiography at detecting changes resulting from synovitis and may be helpful in establishing the presence of synovitis in patients with normal radiographs and uncertainty regarding either the diagnosis or the presence of inflammatory changes, such as patients with obesity or subtle findings on examination.

The wrists are also commonly involved, as are the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints in the feet, but any upper or lower extremity joint may be affected. Symmetric polyarthritis, particularly of the MCP, MTP, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> PIP joints, strongly suggests RA. Although distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint disease can occur in patients with RA, DIP involvement strongly suggests a diagnosis of osteoarthritis or psoriatic arthritis.

Their diagnostic utility is limited by their relatively poor specificity, since they are found in 5 to 10 percent of healthy individuals, 20 to 30 percent of people with SLE, virtually all patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia (usually caused by hepatitis C virus [HCV] infections), and in those with many other inflammatory conditions. Higher titers of RF (at least three times the upper limit of normal) have somewhat greater specificity for RA. The prevalence of RF positivity in healthy individuals rises with age. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Origin and utility of measurement of rheumatoid factors&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biologic-markers-in-the-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biologic markers in the diagnosis and assessment of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Rheumatoid factors'</a>.)</p><p>Antibodies to citrullinated <span class=\"nowrap\">peptides/proteins</span> are usually measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) using CCPs as antigen. Anti-CCP antibodies have a similar sensitivity to RF for RA but have a much higher specificity (95 to 98 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. The specificity is greater in patients with higher titers of anti-CCP antibodies (at least three times the upper limit of normal). Another test, anti-mutated citrullinated vimentin, gives similar results to anti-CCP and is used as an alternative in some laboratories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Normal acute phase reactants may occur in untreated patients with RA, but such findings are very infrequent. The degree of elevation of these acute phase reactants varies with the severity of inflammation. As an example, an ESR of 50 to 80 is not uncommon in patients with severely active RA. By comparison, an ESR of 20 to 30 can be observed with only a few mildly to moderately active joints. Although increased levels of acute phase reactants are not specific for RA, they are often useful for distinguishing inflammatory conditions from noninflammatory disorders that present with musculoskeletal symptoms (eg, osteoarthritis or fibromyalgia).

These criteria were developed for the classification of patients with RA for the purpose of epidemiologic studies and clinical trials, not primarily for clinical diagnosis. Nevertheless, the same features that are of value in classification tend to be useful for the purpose of diagnosis in clinical practice.

Lyme arthritis is characterized by intermittent or persistent inflammatory arthritis in a few large joints, especially the knee. The most commonly involved joints, after the knee, are the shoulder, ankle, elbow, temporomandibular joint, and wrist. Migratory arthralgias without frank arthritis may occur during early localized or early disseminated Lyme disease.

In addition, several clinical features help distinguish Lyme arthritis from RA. Unlike RA, for example, involvement of the small joints of the hands and feet is uncommon in patients with Lyme arthritis. Furthermore, many, but not all, patients with Lyme arthritis will describe an antecedent history of erythema migrans or other early disease manifestations.

We generally make the diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis in such patients who also have psoriasis and are seronegative for RF and anti-CCP. However, we diagnose RA in those with a symmetric polyarthritis who are seropositive for at least one of these antibodies, since skin psoriasis is so common. However, serologic testing and skin findings may not be informative, since patients with RA may not have RF or CCP antibodies (eg, seronegative RA) and the joint symptoms of psoriatic arthritis may precede the onset of skin disease by many years. Such patients should be evaluated and monitored for other signs more characteristic of psoriatic arthritis, such as nail changes or enthesitis; occasional patients exhibit overlapping features of both disorders.</p><p>In some patients with a symmetric inflammatory polyarthritis, the only clue to the diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis is a family history of psoriasis. However, in the majority, the findings of skin psoriasis, nail changes (onychodystrophy), sausage toes or fingers, oligoarticular asymmetric large joint or spinal involvement, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> arthritis mutilans help distinguish the two entities.

Unlike RA, PMR is usually associated with marked myalgias in the shoulders and hips, and joint involvement tends to be milder, more limited, and more often asymmetric.</p><p>Stiffness is thus more axial in PMR and more likely to be described as difficulty getting out of bed, while stiffness in the small joints of the hands and other involved joints predominates in RA, in which difficulty buttoning clothing is more likely to be reported. However, similar complaints to RA may be present in patients with PMR with synovitis affecting the small joints in the hands.</p><p>The arthritis in PMR tends to respond strikingly to modest doses of glucocorticoids used to control other symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In patients initially diagnosed with PMR, persistent or recurrent small joint arthritis with tapering of glucocorticoids and the absence of other findings suggestive of PMR may lead to a change in the diagnosis to RA after several months or even years of treatment.

Peripheral blood leukocytosis with a left shift is common but not invariably present.</p><p>A low threshold for suspecting infection is required, particularly in compromised hosts. Patients with RA are at increased risk for joint infections because a damaged joint can serve as a nidus of infection. Synovial fluid changes, including marked granulocytosis and low glucose levels, are similar to those seen in RA.

The initial evaluation of such patients requires a careful history and physical examination, along with selected laboratory testing to identify features that are characteristic of RA or that suggest an alternative diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H8594869\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for suspected RA'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The following components of the medical evaluation are helpful in making a clinical diagnosis of RA, both for the identification of characteristic findings and for the exclusion of other diagnoses (see <a href=\"#H8594869\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for suspected RA'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A thorough medical history, with particular attention to joint pain, stiffness, and associated functional difficulties</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A complete physical examination to assess for synovitis, limited joint motion, extraarticular disease manifestations, and signs of diseases included in differential diagnosis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Basic and selected laboratory testing, including assays for acute phase reactants (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] and C-reactive protein [CRP]), rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies, and antinuclear antibodies (ANA)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Selected imaging studies, including bilateral radiographs of the hands, wrists, and feet</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Arthrocentesis, if there is diagnostic uncertainty</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of RA can be made in a patient with inflammatory arthritis involving three or more joints, positive RF <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anti-citrullinated <span class=\"nowrap\">peptide/protein</span> antibody, disease duration of more than six weeks, and elevated CRP or ESR, but without evidence of diseases with similar clinical features.
