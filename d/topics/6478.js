The tests listed in the figure do not differentiate Cushing's syndrome from non-Cushing's syndrome because the response of normal corticotropes is most often similar to that of corticotrope adenomas. Thus, testing for the cause of Cushing's syndrome should be performed only if the normal corticotrope responses are suppressed by ongoing hypercortisolism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F79853\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef79853 \">algorithm 1</a>). This precaution will avoid erroneous diagnosis of Cushing's disease in a normal individual or a patient with another cause of Cushing's syndrome.</p><p>Both laboratory and patient errors can cause misleading results.

Because of this, measurement on at least two separate days is recommended. One can abbreviate the diagnostic evaluation by obtaining blood for ACTH measurement on the same days that a late-night cortisol or 24-hour urine specimen is collected if the patient is strongly suspected of having Cushing's syndrome.

The great majority of these patients have a pituitary corticotroph adenoma (Cushing's disease) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F50582\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50582 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F75003\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75003 \">image 3</a>) rather than ectopic ACTH secretion, bearing in mind that ectopic CRH secretion may very rarely cause Cushing's syndrome.</p><p>In patients with the classic form of ectopic ACTH syndrome, the degree of ACTH hypersecretion and excretion of urinary cortisol is typically greater, and hypokalemia is more common than in those with Cushing's disease. However, because of overlap, especially with occult tumors, other tests should be performed to confirm the diagnosis. Ectopic ACTH-secreting tumors typically do not process proopiomelanocortin (POMC) efficiently. Because of this and their higher ACTH production they have a higher plasma ratio of ACTH precursors (POMC and proACTH) to ACTH compared with Cushing's disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/establishing-the-cause-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Because of this concern, we recommend documentation of a twofold or greater increase in urinary free cortisol (UFC) for six to eight weeks before inferior petrosal sinus sampling to ensure that the normal corticotropes are suppressed.</p><p>CRH is not commercially available in certain countries or is more expensive than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a>.

In a larger retrospective series of 56 patients with ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome, desmopressin alone was found to amplify the central to peripheral ACTH gradient and to provide sensitivity and specificities similar to reported series using CRH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/establishing-the-cause-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

However, others have not found such strong predictive values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/establishing-the-cause-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/41,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,48</a>].

In view of the risk of thromboembolic events, some groups give heparin for anticoagulation before the procedure and protamine afterward to avoid the possibility of inferior petrosal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cavernous sinus venous thrombosis, but most do not believe that this is necessary.</p><p>The frequency of less serious complications, such as inguinal or jugular hematomas is less common.</p><p>Some investigators recommend that all patients with ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome undergo bilateral catheterization of the inferior petrosal venous sinuses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/establishing-the-cause-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/47-49,60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49,60,61</a>]. While petrosal sinus sampling has the best overall diagnostic accuracy, it is more expensive, less safe and less available than non-invasive tests.</p><p>In our opinion, the risk of venous sampling is rarely justified in a patient with a clear-cut pituitary tumor larger than 6 mm on MRI if the patient has responses to CRH and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> that support the diagnosis of Cushing's disease.</p><p>In patients with a normal pituitary MRI, it is reasonable to use non-invasive tests first. Hypercortisolemic patients with positive responses to both CRH and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> are nearly certain to have Cushing's disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/establishing-the-cause-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/21,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,28</a>]. Patients with one or more negative responses are still statistically more likely to have Cushing's disease than ectopic ACTH secretion, making petrosal sinus sampling a reasonable alternative to imaging for a non-pituitary tumor. However, there has been no formal study of which algorithm is best. In the absence of such studies, the choice of diagnostic tests will be influenced not only by their availability and cost, but also by other features such as extremely elevated UFC and plasma ACTH concentrations, hypokalemia and rapid onset of hypercortisolism, all of which favor the diagnosis of ectopic ACTH secretion.</p><p>Other candidates for petrosal sampling are patients with non-invasive studies diagnostic of Cushing's disease who have undergone subtotal or total hypophysectomy without clinical improvement or any effect on ACTH secretion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Other venous sampling tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bilateral internal jugular venous sampling has been proposed as a useful alternative test, with the advantages of simplicity, safety, and no requirement for specialized expertise. However, the sensitivity of this test (83 to 87.5 percent) is relatively close to the pre-test probability of Cushing's disease and is inferior to petrosal sinus sampling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/establishing-the-cause-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/43-46,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-46,62</a>]. Its utility may be restricted to those patients who would benefit from venous sampling, such as those with conflicting results on non-invasive tests, but who do not have access to petrosal sinus sampling.</p><p>The limited ability of petrosal sinus sampling to identify the site of corticotroph adenomas led to evaluation of cavernous sinus sampling for this purpose. In two large series, the sensitivity and specificity of a cavernous sinus-to-peripheral venous plasma ACTH gradient were similar to those of petrosal sinus sampling. Localization of the adenoma, based on a lateralization ratio of &ge;1.4, was correct in 62 to 83 percent in whom tumors were found at surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/establishing-the-cause-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. However, hemihypophysectomy was curative in only about 50 percent of patients when it was based on the location of tumor predicted by cavernous sinus sampling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/establishing-the-cause-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Thus, this technically more demanding procedure does not appear to have superior diagnostic accuracy or lateralization ability compared with petrosal sinus sampling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome and its cause lie entirely in the domain of the endocrine laboratory.

The procedure also is indicated before transsphenoidal exploration to document the anatomy of the sella turcica.</p><p>MRI is more sensitive than computed tomography (CT) in detecting corticotroph adenomas, but still detects only about 50 percent of these tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/establishing-the-cause-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Dynamic MRI (ie, obtaining images very rapidly after gadolinium administration) or spoiled gradient recalled acquisition MRI techniques may provide slightly greater sensitivity than conventional MRI, but yield more false-positive scans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/establishing-the-cause-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>].

CT or MRI of the lungs or abdomen is unnecessary in patients who have a positive inferior petrosal sinus sampling test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/establishing-the-cause-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p>CT and MRI scans can identify and localize anatomically some tumors.

Failure to detect these tumors may be related to their small size or inadequate expression of somatostatin receptors. In three studies, 6 of 30 patients had false-positive results (radiation fibrosis, inflammation, follicular thyroid adenoma, accessory spleen). In a few patients, however, scintigraphy but not CT or MR identified the tumor and, in five patients, negative scintigraphy correctly refuted false-positive CT or MRI scans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/establishing-the-cause-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/77-79\" class=\"abstract_t\">77-79</a>].</p><p>Because of the high false positive rate, the presence of the tumor ideally should be confirmed by CT or MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/establishing-the-cause-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/80,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,81</a>].
