The heritability estimates of agoraphobia range from 48 to 61 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/agoraphobia-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. Of the two components of heritability, evidence suggests that moderate genetic influences with nonshared environmental factors are more influential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/agoraphobia-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Shared environmental factors do not appear to have any influence. In twin studies, nonshared environmental factors refer to aspects of the context that the twins do not share such as individualized events and experiences. Shared environmental factors, in contrast, refer to those aspects of the context that the twins do share such as the same home, parents, school, and family traditions. Genetically-based dispositional factors may also play a role.

Matched healthy control participants exhibited no changes in response to stimuli type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/agoraphobia-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. No group differences were found in the perception phase of the study when participants were presented with the stimuli. These findings support the clinical observation that the anxiety experienced in anticipation of a feared situation is often more severe than that experienced from actually being in a feared situation. Increased activation in the ventral striatum and left insula may be one factor contributing to and maintaining agoraphobic avoidance through increased detection of salient events, autonomic readiness, and action to address perceived threat.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H897554\"><span class=\"h2\">Personality factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to broad based constructs such as neuroticism that have been shown to play a developmental role broadly across anxiety and mood disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/agoraphobia-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], dispositional factors have been shown to have a specific association with agoraphobia. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Extroversion/introversion</span> &ndash; Extroversion has been negatively associated with agoraphobia but not panic disorder.

As an example, an individual who experiences anxiety in a grocery store abruptly leaves the situation and finds that leaving results in greatly reduced anxiety. The individual learns that escape is associated with anxiety reduction and thus becomes more likely to escape in future instances of anxiety.

Individuals with agoraphobia will often but not always report fear of panic symptoms, and may or may not have a history of panic attacks. Situations avoided are summarized in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F77033\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77033 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=panic-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Panic disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Reasons for avoiding situations may vary. In the majority of cases, individuals describe avoiding situations for fear of experiencing panic symptoms and consequent embarrassment or feelings of helplessness. Individuals may fear being overwhelmed by symptoms of anxiety to the point that they lose control or die. Loss of control concerns are specific to the individual and may include fears of loss of bowel or bladder control, vomiting, fainting, &ldquo;going crazy&rdquo; or becoming unable to function. In some instances, individuals may have more difficulty describing the nature of their fear and may report a feeling of general dread or impending doom.</p><p>In a study of 41 individuals with a lifetime history of agoraphobia grouped as those with panic disorder and those without panic attacks, the most common reason for avoidance given in both groups was a fear of becoming &ldquo;suddenly incapacitated&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/agoraphobia-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>It is common for individuals with moderate to severe agoraphobia to describe having a &ldquo;safe zone&rdquo; within which they feel comfortable. This may be their house or a certain perimeter around their neighborhood. Leaving this zone of safety may be completely avoided, particularly if travelling alone, or otherwise endured with distress. Individuals with agoraphobia often engage in safety behaviors to reduce their level of anxiety in a particular situation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F58076\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58076 \">table 2</a>). Safety behaviors are actions an individual takes to prevent a feared outcome from occurring or cope with a perceived threat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/agoraphobia-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. In agoraphobia, safety behaviors may be overt (eg, escape, avoidance, being accompanied by a &ldquo;safe&rdquo; person) or more subtle (eg, sitting in a location near an exit or carrying an item that is perceived to provide comfort or protection). Safety behaviors may play a role in perpetuating the disorder.</p><p>The presence of agoraphobia is associated with significant impairment in functioning, degree of disability, and level of unemployment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/agoraphobia-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Onset may also be categorized as early or late. A 2015 Dutch study examining distribution models of onset in 507 individuals diagnosed with agoraphobia suggests that the illness may be subtyped as early onset when it begins at age 27 or earlier and late onset when it begins after age 27 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/agoraphobia-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

If an individual's presentation meets criteria for panic disorder and agoraphobia, both diagnoses should be assigned. </p><p>The presence of panic disorder and a history of panic attacks should be assessed given that agoraphobia often presents concurrently with panic disorder or panic-like symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=panic-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Panic disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4902831\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The fears and situational avoidance characteristic of agoraphobia overlap with a number of disorders. Careful assessment is needed to complete a differential diagnosis.</p><p><strong>Social anxiety disorder</strong> &mdash; In social anxiety disorder (or social phobia), fears are focused on negative evaluation by others and avoidance is typically limited to social situations. Although fear of social embarrassment from anxiety symptoms may be present in agoraphobia, it is not typically the sole focus of fear. In addition, an individual with agoraphobia will avoid situations whether people are present or not, whereas an individual with social anxiety disorder typically would feel more comfortable entering a situation if no other people were present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Social anxiety disorder in adults: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H897610\"><span class=\"h3\">Specific phobia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the case of multiple specific phobias and agoraphobia, a person may report avoiding a range of situations. Determining the focus of the fear in each situation will assist in distinguishing the two. In multiple specific phobias, fears are typically focused on specific aspects of the situation or object that differ across avoided situations. For example, an individual with multiple specific phobias may avoid elevators for fear of becoming trapped (specific phobia), driving for fear of getting in an accident (situational phobia), and walking in grassy open areas for fear of encountering a snake (specific animal phobia). In agoraphobia, an individual may fear these same situations (elevators, driving, walking in open areas) but the focus of fear is the same across the situations (eg, fear of having panic symptoms, being unable to get help if needed or becoming incapacitated in the situation.). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=specific-phobia-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Specific phobia in adults: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, course and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p><strong>Posttraumatic stress disorder</strong> &mdash; Examining triggers and the context of avoidance may distinguish posttraumatic stress disorder from agoraphobia. In posttraumatic stress disorder, a history of trauma is present and avoidance is associated with trauma-specific cues. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Posttraumatic stress disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p><strong>Obsessive-compulsive disorder</strong> &mdash; Obsessive-compulsive disorder may result in significant avoidance that may resemble agoraphobia. Determining the reasons for avoidance assists in distinguishing the disorders. If an individual is avoiding situations for fear of triggering an obsession, then a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder is likely (eg, avoidance of a range of public situations for fear of contamination). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obsessive-compulsive disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H897631\"><span class=\"h3\">Separation anxiety disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both agoraphobia and separation anxiety disorder are characterized by situational avoidance. Examining the focus of concern will help to distinguish these disorders. In separation anxiety disorder, fear is focused on separation from home or major attachment figures and harm befalling major attachment figures (eg, a son worries about his mother getting into a car accident). In agoraphobia, the fear is focused on the situation and personal catastrophe that may occur (eg, being overcome by panic or anxiety symptoms, being unable to get help if needed). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-fears-and-phobias-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of fears and phobias in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H897638\"><span class=\"h3\">Major depressive disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Social withdrawal and anhedonia characteristic of major depressive disorder may resemble avoidance characteristics of agoraphobia. Determining the reasons for avoidance is helpful in distinguishing the two disorders. In agoraphobia, individuals often wish they could enter a situation but feel unable to do so because of anxiety. In contrast, individuals with depression describe a lack of interest or energy that results in reduced engagement in activities and avoidance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-neurobiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and neurobiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p><strong>General medical conditions</strong> &mdash; Certain general medical conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome or Crohn&rsquo;s disease may be associated with significant anxiety and situational avoidance. If the anxiety and avoidance are confined to fears related to the illness, such as losing control of the bowels in the context of irritable bowel syndrome, the <span class=\"nowrap\">fear/avoidance</span> should be clearly excessive compared to that typically seen with these conditions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H897652\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment tools</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Comprehensive diagnostic interviews that assess agoraphobia include the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM 5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/agoraphobia-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>] and the Anxiety and Related Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-5 (ADIS-5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/agoraphobia-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. These instruments are time consuming (approximately two hours in a mental health clinical setting) and may not be practical in a general practice setting. If a setting is focused on assessment and treatment of anxiety disorders, it is recommended that a structured diagnostic interview be used to ensure a thorough diagnostic assessment.

Commonly feared situations include crowds, shopping malls, driving, public transportation, and being away from home. (See <a href=\"#H897589\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Agoraphobia is an independent disorder in DSM-5, which may or may not co-occur with panic disorder and with panic attacks. Avoidance in agoraphobia often develops in response to unexpected panic attacks and the person avoids certain situations in an attempt to avoid future attacks <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> to avoid being incapacitated and unable to escape if an attack were to occur. Agoraphobia in the absence of panic <span class=\"nowrap\">symptoms/disorder</span> develops in response to other fears, for example, fears about being incapacitated or unable to cope in particular situations.

In severe cases, people may become housebound. Individuals may engage in a variety of safety behaviors to manage their anxiety when confronting feared situations including being accompanied by a companion who increases feelings of security, carrying a cell phone or antianxiety medication, and sitting near an exit or door to increase ease of escape if needed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F58076\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58076 \">table 2</a>).
