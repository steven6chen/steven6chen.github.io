These individuals most often do not have a predictable prognosis and are not eligible for or interested in electing formal hospice services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-delivery-in-the-home/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. These patients are among an increasing number of elderly and frail persons who are homebound, usually due to the presence of multiple chronic illnesses including cognitive impairment with resultant functional limitations and decline. In 2011, approximately two million people or 5.6 percent of the elderly Medicare population living in the community were completely or mostly homebound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-delivery-in-the-home/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The majority of these patients experience significant symptoms associated with their advanced diseases, in particular, pain and depression. More than 50 percent of these people prefer to be cared for in the home setting, expressing this preference particularly when asked about end of life care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-delivery-in-the-home/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>Palliative care is an approach to care for any patient diagnosed with a serious illness that is delivered by an interdisciplinary team of health professionals. Palliative care team members manage pain and other physical symptoms, facilitate communication, assist with decision-making, and coordinate care across settings throughout the disease trajectory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-delivery-in-the-home/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Palliative care support is relevant to a broad range of diagnoses for patients of all ages, including those living with serious medical conditions that adversely affect daily functioning or will lead to a reduction in life expectancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-delivery-in-the-home/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In circumstances of advanced illness and the end of life, the effort to move to other settings for evaluation and treatment may not be in line with the patient&rsquo;s preferences or best interests. Palliative care provided in the home setting is associated with a reduction in symptom burden and increase in patient and caregiver satisfaction; in addition, studies in the United States and elsewhere also show that it results in decreased utilization of resources and costs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-delivery-in-the-home/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>]. One study published in 2014 showed that patients with terminal cancer who received palliative home-care services were more likely to die at home, and during the last two months of their lives were less likely to be hospitalized and when hospitalized spent less time in the hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-delivery-in-the-home/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Furthermore, adults who receive home-based palliative care are more likely to have an advance care directive and discussions about goals of care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-delivery-in-the-home/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advance-care-planning-and-advance-directives\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advance care planning and advance directives&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic will discuss the delivery of palliative care in the home, including a review of the different models of home-based palliative care and an outline of the specific components of a home visit. Other aspects of palliative care are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of comprehensive patient assessment in palliative care&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-symptom-assessment-in-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to symptom assessment in palliative care&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1052252039\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Palliative care delivered in the home is ideal for patients who are &ldquo;homebound&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-delivery-in-the-home/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. There are no universal criteria to define what makes a patient homebound. In the United States (US), reasonable criteria have been set by the <a href=\"http://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/downloads/bp102c07.pdf&amp;token=oI419vXwP3E8b+xyRCE2A/BrUcUCPm8Ww2vY/+NQQbIrRDRm8MH+DLyza/10TfHINaGIhoePDEX55Mw+PAxY4Ey45PoHrN7olt70h3uO+SxY3VFNg8P6KKnt6wjJ6F4y&amp;TOPIC_ID=83642\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Medicare homebound rule</a>. These apply to patients with a serious illness and those who have experienced a serious injury. In order to qualify as homebound, such persons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Need the aide of supportive devices (eg, crutch, cane, wheelchair, walker, or special transportation) OR</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Require the assistance of another person in order to leave their place of residence OR</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a condition that renders leaving his or her home medically contraindicated.</p><p/><p>In addition, patients should be unable to leave the home normally such that attempts to do so would require a considerable and taxing effort.</p><p>It is important to note that at least in the US, patients receiving home-based palliative care are not required to meet the definition of being homebound as it applies to home health, particularly if the clinician determines it is medically necessary to see a patient in the home setting to optimize their assessment and treatment plan. However, documentation of the need for home-based care is required for medical coverage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28071973\"><span class=\"h1\">MODELS FOR PALLIATIVE CARE IN THE HOME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States (US), there are several models for the provision of home-based palliative care services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-delivery-in-the-home/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Many factors determine which services can be available in a patient&rsquo;s community, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Constraints of the local health system</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local coverage for services (including insurance and other payers)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Financial resources of patients in the catchment area </p><p/><p>Home-based palliative care services may be offered as an extension of a geriatrics or primary care practice, such as a Patient Centered Medical Home (primary and palliative) or as an integrated specialty service that actively collaborates and co-manages as part of a Medical Neighborhood. It may be provided via home care (home health-based), hospice agencies, or a hospital-based palliative care program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-delivery-in-the-home/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. These are discussed in more detail below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28072043\"><span class=\"h2\">Home-based primary and palliative care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Home-based primary and palliative care programs integrate palliative care into comprehensive primary care through an interdisciplinary team. Home-based primary and palliative care programs may be based in private primary care practices, within group specialty practices such as oncology or cardiology, academic medical centers, community-based organizations, or within hospital-based health systems (eg, a Veterans Affairs Medical Center).<strong> </strong>These teams are most often led by a physician or advance practice nurse, and can include nurses, clinical pharmacists, social workers, psychologists, and physical and other types of therapists. Team members ideally have added training and expertise in palliative care to allow them to provide specialty level palliative care services in the home. </p><p>Home-based primary and palliative care programs provide home visits during business hours and most provide 24-hour and weekend phone <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> visit availability. In addition, some programs are able to deliver medications to the home, much like hospice, and also provide longitudinal primary care, urgent care, and transitional care. Patients enrolled in these programs are primarily patients with multiple chronic medical conditions, high symptom burden, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> complex care coordination needs. For these patients, the bundling of primary care with specialty-level palliative care can be particularly advantageous because it affords the integration of palliative care principles into longitudinal health care relationships and can reduce the symptom burdens of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-delivery-in-the-home/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Many of these patients continue to see their primary care physicians and treating specialists in office settings but require additional regular home visits by health professionals to promote adherence to complex care plans. Access to specialty palliative care support has been demonstrated to improve quality of life for patients and their caregivers, lower the burden of home care for the caregiver, improve symptom management, and decrease unnecessary hospital and emergency room utilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-delivery-in-the-home/abstract/1,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,17</a>].</p><p>Although data are limited, they appear to support the use of these programs. For example, in one observational study, 140 patients enrolled in a home-based palliative and primary care program were followed using telephone-based surveys to assess symptom burden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-delivery-in-the-home/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Patients reported significant reductions in symptoms (including pain, anxiety, depression, fatigue, and loss of appetite) as early as three weeks following enrollment, which were maintained at 12 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-delivery-in-the-home/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28072126\"><span class=\"h2\">Home health-based model</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The home health-based model includes two types of services: home health care and palliative home health care. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Home health care is frequently used as a post-acute care delivery provider although it is also available for patients without a preceding hospitalization if their provider has determined skilled nursing need is necessary, such as: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Frequent monitoring of blood pressure, fluid status, or blood glucose</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>More rigorous assessment of symptoms, including pain, dyspnea, constipation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Management of complex wounds</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patient education around therapy (eg, home glucose monitoring and insulin self-administration)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Assessment of medication adherence</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Physical, occupational, and speech therapies. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The main goal of home health care is rehabilitation. As a result, most US agencies do not offer 24-7 support or emergent home visits, and usually do not deliver medications to the home. In the US, patients are eligible for home health under Part A Medicare when they require intermittent skilled nursing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> physical, occupational, or speech therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-delivery-in-the-home/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palliative home health care (sometimes referred to as home health-based palliative care) is typically provided by an interdisciplinary team like home-based primary and palliative care programs but utilizes the home health model. However, palliative home health care is not reimbursed as a Medicare Part A benefit in the US unless it fulfills the same criteria as traditional home health. </p><p/><p>Home health services can combine rehabilitation with the competencies of palliative care (to relieve suffering, alleviate distressing symptoms, and facilitate discussion around realistic goals of care, and documentation of advance care planning). Access to professional support has been demonstrated to improve quality of life for patients in palliative care and their caregivers, lower the burden of home care for the caregiver, improve symptom management, and decrease unnecessary hospital and emergency room utilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-delivery-in-the-home/abstract/1,7,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,17</a>]. </p><p>However, patients with advanced <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> end-stage disease may derive limited benefits from home health services because care is often time limited to a particular episode for which skilled needs have been defined. As a result, once the objectives of care are met, a patient is usually discharged without assistance for ongoing care management. This can be a particularly vulnerable time for patients with complex illnesses. In our experience, it is not unusual for the organization of care to deteriorate after home health care has been discontinued, which increases the stress for the caregiver and may prompt rehospitalization or use of the emergency department.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28072377\"><span class=\"h2\">Hospice model</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hospice is the most intensive, refined form of home-based palliative care for patients whose life expectancy is typically defined in months and who are no longer benefitting from disease-directed interventions. In the US, hospice care is supported by defined insurance coverage and reimbursed on a per diem basis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hospice-philosophy-of-care-and-appropriate-utilization-in-the-united-states\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hospice: Philosophy of care and appropriate utilization in the United States&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Unlike patients receiving home-based palliative and primary care and palliative home health care, hospice care (at least in the US) is available to patients who have been formally certified as being in the terminal phases of an illness by their physicians, which is defined as a life expectancy of six months or less. Hospice care is provided by a dedicated interdisciplinary team comprised of nurses, physicians, social workers, chaplains, and home aides, all of whom have experience and knowledge caring for patients at the end of life. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hospice-philosophy-of-care-and-appropriate-utilization-in-the-united-states#H691104\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hospice: Philosophy of care and appropriate utilization in the United States&quot;, section on 'Eligibility'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28072432\"><span class=\"h2\">Bridge programs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the US, many hospice programs have established home-based palliative care &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; programs for patients who do not choose to elect the hospice benefit, or do not meet hospice eligibility criteria at the time of referral. The services provided by these bridge programs vary widely and they are not regulated or standardized. Some may be limited to volunteer support or intermittent social work visits; others may involve nursing care. </p><p>As a result of bridge programs, a broader population of patients and families can benefit from the expert interdisciplinary care focused on symptom management along with patient and family support provided by hospice teams. These programs can also facilitate a transition to hospice care when the patient is eligible and desirous of hospice support.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2244752536\"><span class=\"h2\">Palliative care consultative model</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Palliative care consultations are generally offered as extensions of a growing number of hospital-based palliative care programs. The physician or advanced practice professional (APP) providing consultation in the home may partner with a community nursing or hospice agency in order to facilitate full interdisciplinary team support. There is variation in the populations served by the consultative model, as well as the way programs are structured and reimbursed. For example, palliative care may be provided to patients who had been followed on the inpatient palliative care service, those referred by primary care or specialists, or those identified as high risk by the hospital for readmission. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H113019815\"><span class=\"h1\">THE HOME VISIT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Visiting patients in their homes affords the clinician a very different perspective on the patient&rsquo;s life. Clinicians see their patients in their own environment, allowing providers to directly assess the functional status of a patient, meet family members and caregivers, or conduct a family meeting in a setting familiar and comfortable to the patient and family. Seeing a patient within their own home provides a unique opportunity to observe the conditions in which the patient lives and who lives with them, who provides care, or who is available for support. These observations can give insight into the patient&rsquo;s past, their current functional status, caregiving needs, medication adherence, access to food, family dynamics, cleanliness, and safety of the home as well as safety of the neighborhood and access to pharmacies and groceries. </p><p>Conveying respect and asking permission are especially important in the home visit. Questions such as &quot;May I sit here?&quot; or &quot;Where would you like to talk first?&rdquo; are essential and convey respect and attentiveness. The provider should recognize that they are entering the private space of another at all times. Given the nature of seeing patients at home, patients and families may seek to create a more social atmosphere for the provider, including offering food and drink. In some cultures, this is a very important ritual and to refuse may be offensive. The provider must remain focused and alert first to the needs of the patient and goals for the visit and skillfully manage the time spent in other activities.</p><p>During the home visit the clinician should define a specific goal or reason for the appointment to substantiate the need for the visit (medical necessity) and the reason it is occurring in the home setting. In the United States (US), this information helps to justify the appropriateness of billing. </p><p>The content of the home visit will differ depending on the provider; however, the structure of the visit should remain the same whenever possible, for both the initial evaluation and during follow-up visits. Maintaining consistency can be a source of reassurance for the patient and his or her family. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1052252103\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a variety of reasons that patients may require a home visit rather than make the trip to a clinician&rsquo;s office, including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-delivery-in-the-home/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immobility, cognitive impairment, or a serious psychiatric condition</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Request prompted by a home health team member, the patient, or the patient&rsquo;s family member</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Importance of meeting the patient with his or her caregiver in order to make medical decisions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The opportunity to directly observe the patient in his or her home environment to better assess the patient&rsquo;s functional abilities, the caregiver&rsquo;s understanding of the complex medical issues present and ability to meet the patient&rsquo;s needs, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> to verify eligibility for services by third-party providers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The need to meet with community-based providers on-site </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To assess care coordination and transitions of care in order to reduce hospital readmissions. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H369118668\"><span class=\"h2\">Before the visit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the setting, it is essential to prepare in advance for the visit. Steps to ensure that one is prepared include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ensure that you have directions to the home, including phone numbers for the patient and caregivers. Call ahead so that the patient and caregivers are expecting you.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bring supplies which are listed in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F95687\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95687 \">table 1</a>). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Review the patient&rsquo;s medical records, including the notes of other providers and any recent phone calls.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Review of the patient&rsquo;s primary diagnosis and comorbidities (if present), including his or her past visits and anticipated course during home palliative care.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Understand the reason for referral and the home visit. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Develop a preliminary care plan, including identification of any areas that may need follow-up, review, reassessment, or reinforcement. Plan to create a more complete care plan at the end of each visit, integrating the patient&rsquo;s and family&rsquo;s direct input.</p><p/><p>Adopting a systematical approach before the visit can help ensure that the visit will be effective and efficient and reduces the likelihood that some important aspect (eg, medication review) of assessment or care is not performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-delivery-in-the-home/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H369118674\"><span class=\"h2\">During the visit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A standardized checklist should be used during each visit to ensure no areas of concern are missed. For older patients, a visit to a patient&rsquo;s home provides the opportunity to assess many of the components of the comprehensive geriatric assessment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=comprehensive-geriatric-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Comprehensive geriatric assessment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For all patients, the following areas should be addressed: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptom assessment &mdash; During the visit, the clinician can assess and observe for symptoms such as pain, dyspnea, <span class=\"nowrap\">nausea/vomiting,</span> fatigue, depression, anxiety, diarrhea, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> constipation. Where possible, symptom assessment should use validated scales, including visual analog scales, to help convey symptom severity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Functional assessment &mdash; Being present in the home provides the opportunity to observe the patient&rsquo;s ability to complete activities of daily living and what assistance devices, formal or informal, they use about their home. For example, this may include the need for a walker or bedside commode. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical safety &mdash; The clinician should assess for obstacles to patient movement that may increase the risk of injury including stairs, inadequate lighting, clutter, uneven surfaces, and throw rugs. For patients on oxygen, this also includes evaluation of electric cords and tubing. Based on the safety review, the clinician may make recommendations about the need for assistive devices or a hospital bed aimed at easing transfers and preventing falls. This includes evaluation of the patient&rsquo;s ability to ambulate and perform activities of daily living. Finally, it includes evaluation of electric outlets to ensure there is low risk of overloading.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medication safety and storage &mdash; In addition to routine medication reconciliation, clinicians should review where patients keep their medication and how they take and dispose of them, including oral therapies and cutaneous patches. Ensure there are no medication errors, duplications, and issues with safety to others in the home, particularly children. As part of reconciliation, assessment of barriers to adherence is also important.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment of nutrition &mdash; This includes an evaluation of food and fluid availability, access to meals, and ease of availability to nutrition. It may include assessments of the kitchen and pantry, so the clinician can assess for food safety, storage, and freshness. This is particularly important for patients who appear to be left at home alone for long periods of time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation for social support &mdash; This includes checking in with caregivers regarding caregiver burden and need for support and respite, ensuring the patient has adequate home care support and noting possible evidence of neglect or abuse. </p><p/><p>Clinicians should recognize that their entering a patient&rsquo;s home can result in the patient (and his or her family) feeling a heightened sense of vulnerability and a fear of judgment. In our experience, acknowledging and affirming what they are doing appropriately can help ease these feelings and enhances trust and openness on both sides. Even after the death of a loved one, patients have commented on how helpful and affirming this can be. </p><p>Prior to leaving, ensure that any questions have been answered and that a follow-up evaluation is scheduled. We find it useful to facilitate teach-back to ensure key information has been effectively shared [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-delivery-in-the-home/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. It is important that teach-back does not feel like a test or create shame when a person struggles with health literacy. A simple question that can give insight to retention of information in a nonthreatening way is:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&ldquo;If you were to explain to your family (caregiver, daughter, etc.) what we discussed today, what would you tell them?&rdquo;</p><p/><p>Just as in an office visit with an outpatient provider, patients and families appear to benefit from a verbal and written review of any recommendations or changes that were made as a result of the visit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-delivery-in-the-home/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], which also lie at the heart of the US Meaningful Use clinical quality measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-delivery-in-the-home/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. It may be worthwhile when family or caregivers cannot be present during the appointment to have them on speakerphone to review the care plan.</p><p>Although preparation and planning are key to effective and efficient visits, frequently clinical or social changes may occur between visits. The anticipated plan for the visit may suddenly change and the clinician is required to be nimble in resetting goals for the appointment to best meet the needs of patients and families. In addition, the assessment of one provider can help to inform the goals of others on the interdisciplinary team and prompt the need for follow-up by others on the team. </p><p>As an example, the caregiver expressing anxiety and fear may naturally allow the introduction of the social worker or chaplain, and the patient&rsquo;s physical complaints to the social worker or expressed concerns regarding medications to the chaplain can prompt a physician or nurse practitioner visit for further diagnosis and treatment. Such interactions are not only important but may lend more insight into the visit, no matter what the previously defined goals were. Dual visits by a physician and social worker, or by an advanced practice professional (eg, nurse practitioner) and other team member may be very helpful, particularly when psychosocial or spiritual needs are high along with medical issues.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H369119041\"><span class=\"h2\">Advance care planning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Caring for patients at home provides a unique opportunity to establish relationships with patients and families in order to facilitate ongoing discussions around advance directives, including documentation of a patient&rsquo;s healthcare proxy and stated preferences around resuscitation.

However, it is important to ensure that a physician-signed document be completed and available in the home (eg, Do Not Resuscitate [DNR] order or Physician Order for Life Sustaining Treatment [POLST]) because these are the medical orders that emergency workers will follow if they are called. Other names for a POLST include (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advance-care-planning-and-advance-directives#H23369606\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advance care planning and advance directives&quot;, section on 'Physician Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment'</a>): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment (MOLST)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinician Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment (COLST)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical Orders for Scope of Treatment (MOST) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physician Orders for Scope of Treatment (POST)</p><p/><p>These documents provide an opportunity for health care professionals and patients to document patient&rsquo;s preference around resuscitation, medical interventions, artificial <span class=\"nowrap\">nutrition/hydration,</span> and antibiotics as a medical order.

This is particularly important in situations when members of the interdisciplinary team feel unsafe in a neighborhood or home, particularly in the event of an urgent visit after hours. Organizations typically provide security personnel to accompany the providers who have to make visits in areas where they do not feel safe, particularly after hours. Other safety precautions include scheduling visits for daytime, using a team to allow for joint visits, gaining knowledge about the community in which visits are conducted, and having a cell phone and emergency line available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-delivery-in-the-home/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. If the team feels that despite taking extra precautions the visit is unsafe, plans should be made to refer the patient to the appropriate outpatient setting for care. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H369118983\"><span class=\"h1\">COMMUNICATION AND CARE COORDINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Caring for a patient in the home requires addressing many medical and psychosocial needs. It is important when providing home-based palliative care to learn about and establish relationships with available community resources including home care, hospice, rehabilitative services (speech, <span class=\"nowrap\">PT/OT),</span> mental health services, spiritual services, caregiver support services, durable medical equipment, nutritional services, home infusion therapy, and community volunteer services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-delivery-in-the-home/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. It also requires communication between all those involved in the patient&rsquo;s care, including clinicians, formal caregivers (ie, trained and paid personnel) and informal caregivers (friends <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> family). Part of this is ensuring that all caregivers know whom to contact with questions and to notify in the case of an emergency or change in clinical condition. This can be done by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ensuring patients have access to a formal triage system &ndash; The ability to respond to patients in a timely manner is important and can be achieved by the availability of urgent visitation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a 24-hour phone triage system. A good triage system assists providers in promptly attending to the problems that can be addressed in the home and facilitating the proper follow-up, both of which can aid in preventing unwanted or unnecessary emergency room utilization and hospitalizations. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coordinating care between the involved clinicians to establish one contact person &ndash; Care coordination is important, especially when palliative care providers cannot guarantee 24-hour coverage. Ensuring that providers are available to assess family concerns and questions is essential in coordinating patient care and addressing urgent concerns. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased involvement of social workers and care coordinators who accompany the patient and family to the hospital <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> visit regularly, as well as the establishment of relationships with visiting nurse agencies and other home care agencies for post-hospitalization care.</p><p/><p>When hospital evaluation or higher level care is needed, clear communication with emergency department and hospital teams allows for the sharing of medical history and previously established goals of care. Communication can be done through an integrated medical record (if the healthcare system between inpatient and outpatient services are the same), written information, or via electronic sources (eg, phone calls <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> encrypted email). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H113019835\"><span class=\"h1\">ROLE OF CAREGIVERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Caregivers usually help with activities of daily living such as bathing, dressing, transferring, toileting, and eating, as well as instrumental activities of daily living such as grocery shopping and meal preparation. Such services can be provided informally by unpaid family members and friends or formally by privately hired workers who are paid for out of pocket or by agency employed workers funded in the United States (US) by private insurance, public payers, or long term care insurance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-delivery-in-the-home/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p>Individuals who provide personal assistance services in the community are referred to by different titles including: home care aides or workers, home health attendants or aides, and personal care aides. In the US, home healthcare workers cannot administer enteral feeds or medications, especially if they are paid for by commercial entities. Those caregivers who work for a licensed home health agency usually receive some supervision by visiting nurses. In addition to overseeing the care of homebound patients receiving care from aides, visiting nurses may be involved in patient&rsquo;s care directly when a skilled nursing need is identified. Episodic use of skilled home care is frequent when a home-based palliative care program is involved in longitudinal care. Skilled home care nursing is typically reimbursed through Medicare Part A. Physical, occupational, speech, and respiratory therapists are also available to attend to acute patient care needs.</p><p>Patients receiving home palliative care often rely on family and friends as caregivers. Unfortunately, most caregivers are poorly prepared for what this entails. In a focus group conducted by the United Hospital Fund&rsquo;s Families and Health Care project, caregivers reported lack of information about patients&rsquo; diagnoses, prognoses, treatment plans, side effects of medication, and symptoms to monitor, as well as whom to call with questions or concerns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-delivery-in-the-home/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H369118782\"><span class=\"h2\">Burden of caregiving</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Informal caregivers (eg, family and friends) caring for a loved one at home are at risk for significant emotional, physical, and financial stress. For example, studies have demonstrated that caregivers, especially those perceiving the work as stressful, are at increased risk for heart attack and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-delivery-in-the-home/abstract/10,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,29,30</a>]. Another study of nearly 1000 patients with end-stage disease (52 percent cancer, 18 percent heart disease, and 11 percent chronic pulmonary disease) and their identified caregivers found that caregivers of patients with substantial care needs experience economic and psychosocial burdens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-delivery-in-the-home/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. It has been shown that the burden of caregiving can be reduced by good communication with providers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-delivery-in-the-home/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], the assistance and support of an interdisciplinary team [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-delivery-in-the-home/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], and educational programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-delivery-in-the-home/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p>In addition to education and support provided to caregivers by the interdisciplinary team, tools are available to assess for caregiver burden such as the Zerit assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-delivery-in-the-home/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. This caregiver self-report questionnaire asks caregivers a range of questions and is available in a variety of languages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-delivery-in-the-home/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p>A well-coordinated, interdisciplinary care team can have a positive impact on caregiver burden. One study found that involvement in an interdisciplinary home-based primary care program led to decreased unmet needs by caregivers, related to daily chores and transportation needs, and decreased caregiver burden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-delivery-in-the-home/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. A study of the effectiveness of an outpatient palliative care team providing interdisciplinary care and care coordination also showed that this support lowered caregiver burden, anxiety, and depression and led to increased perceived quality of life amongst both patients and caregivers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-delivery-in-the-home/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A systematic literature review of patient and carers receiving home-based palliative care found that the most frequently reported unmet need was effective communication with health care providers; other identified unmet needs included psychosocial, practical, informational, and respite. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3815896\"><span class=\"h1\">US COVERAGE FOR HOME-BASED PALLIATIVE CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Changes in the United States (US) Medicare reimbursement system penalize hospitals for readmissions that occur within a 30-day timeframe. As a result, there is an increasing incentive to continue support for patients with chronic or complex illnesses across settings of care, as they most often represent the high-acuity, high-cost portion for medical spending. This has led to increased interest in home-based care programs, particularly for patients who are facing a serious or life-threatening illness.</p><p>Unfortunately, the fee-for-service model of reimbursement in the US is insufficient to support home-based palliative care. Given the prominent need for care coordination and the interdisciplinary model of care, new financial models that involve per-member, per-month reimbursements or shared savings are being evaluated as effective means to support this delivery of care. This payment model aligns incentives with what is meaningful care for patients and families and better addresses efforts to provide population health management. Payment reform in this area is in the early phases and is aligned with changes on a national level in the US. The American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine&rsquo;s quick reference guide to physician coding, billing, and reimbursement is available online [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-delivery-in-the-home/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H369118620\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIATING REFERRAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States (US), insurance carriers and healthcare services within the US are developing algorithms to help identify high risk patients based on combinations of claims data, healthcare utilization, and prescribed medications. Examples include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Home-base palliative care programs may work alongside home health agencies to identify appropriate patients for palliative care services.

This discussion should include (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life#H194019128\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palliative care: The last hours and days of life&quot;, section on 'When death occurs'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A review of advance care planning</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ensuring that appropriate documents around life sustaining treatment preferences are readily available in the home</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asking if family or caregivers would like to hear about specific changes they might observe during the dying process</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Making sure that a provider is available by phone for family and caregivers to contact with questions or concern. </p><p/><p>For patients near death, the interdisciplinary team can help families prepare by facilitating funeral arrangements (eg, having the number of a funeral home on hand) and beginning bereavement screening and support. In the United States (US), the laws and regulations around responding to a death at home vary, sometimes within individual counties of a state. Therefore, the provider should be familiar with the local regulations regarding death in the home. In addition, it is important that any group providing home-based palliative care and caring for patients dying at home be familiar with the regional regulations within their practice area. </p><p>A family&rsquo;s reaction to death in the home may vary greatly, even when the death is anticipated. Ideally, a care plan for an expected death is established in advance, such that the provider and family can discuss what to anticipate with the family, access hospice care when eligible, and be confident as to the necessary next steps after death occurs. Sometimes, even in the face of chronic illness, the death seems to come as a surprise and the family can react with great emotion and anxiety. </p><p>When death occurs, the focus of the care plan shifts to the family. The provider must be attentive to the needs of the family and help facilitate the necessary logistics such as the pronouncement of death, the removal of the body, and the necessary documentation. However, these logistics should be sensitively facilitated so that the family does not feel rushed or stressed. Care after death includes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-delivery-in-the-home/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Honoring the spiritual <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cultural wishes of the diseased person and their <span class=\"nowrap\">family/caregivers</span> while ensuring the legal obligations are complete.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preparing the body for transfer to the mortuary or funeral home.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Offering family and caregivers present the opportunity to participate in the process and supporting them to do so.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ensuring that the health and safety of those who come in contact with the deceased are protected.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Honoring wishes for organ, tissue, or body donation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Returning the deceased person&rsquo;s personal possessions to their relatives.</p><p/><p>At death in particular, there may be rituals, customs, or religious rites that are very important to a family that should be supported. Inquiry by the provider as to this may be helpful for a family who is seemingly unprepared: &ldquo;Are there any rituals or customs that are important to you to which we should attend?&rdquo; It may be very helpful for the body to remain in the home for many hours for visitation by family members and loved ones.
