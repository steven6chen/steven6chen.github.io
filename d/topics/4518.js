The outer ring is composed of ethinyl estradiol (EE) and an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer that contains crystals of etonogestrel (ENG), the 3 keto-metabolite of desogestrel. The device is latex-free. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16530823\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacokinetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ring releases 15 mcg of EE and 120 mcg of ENG per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-vaginal-ring/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. There is an immediate increase in serum hormonal concentration after insertion with a slow decrease over the cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-vaginal-ring/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The concentration of EE is lower with the vaginal ring compared to other combined hormonal contraceptives:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, the maximum serum concentration of EE was 30 percent lower than desogestrel-containing oral contraceptives (OCs) (34.7 &plusmn; 17.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/L</span> versus 124.9 &plusmn; 46.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/L)</span> and systemic exposure to EE was half that of desogestrel-containing OCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-vaginal-ring/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a randomized trial comparing a levonorgestrel-containing OC, transdermal patch, and vaginal ring, users of the vaginal ring experienced 3.4 times lower EE exposure than patch users, and 2.1 times lower EE exposure than OC users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-vaginal-ring/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Exposure to EE in the ring, OC, and patch groups were 10.6 &plusmn; 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng-h/mL,</span> 21.9 &plusmn; 2.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng-h/mL,</span> and 35.8 &plusmn; 5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng-h/mL,</span> respectively. These differences were not all proportional to differences in EE dose of the three contraceptives: 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span> for the OC, 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span> for the patch, and 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span> for the ring.</p><p/><p>Unlike OCs where the peak concentration of the progestin occurs daily, the vaginal ring reaches its peak ENG concentration once per cycle, within seven days of insertion. Systemic exposure to ENG (as determined by area-under-the-curve) is similar for the vaginal ring and desogestrel-containing OCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-vaginal-ring/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28791952\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism and duration of action</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inhibition of ovulation is the principle mechanism of contraceptive action [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-vaginal-ring/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Other mechanisms of action include thickening of cervical mucus, which prevents penetration of sperm into the upper genital tract, inhibition of sperm capacitation, and slowing of tubal motility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-vaginal-ring/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Ovulation is completely inhibited when, as recommended, the ring is left in place for three weeks and then removed for one week. In two studies, continuous off-label use of the ring for five weeks before removal resulted in inhibition of ovulation during this period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-vaginal-ring/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. In another study, serum estrogen and progestin concentrations remained in the therapeutic range for six weeks, with minimal follicular development and endometrial proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-vaginal-ring/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28791959\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECTIVENESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vaginal ring is a highly effective method of contraception when used consistently and correctly. The failure rate, defined as the number of pregnancies per 100 woman-years of exposure in the first year of use, is equivalent to that of oral contraceptives (OCs) and the patch (0.3 percent for perfect use and 9 percent for typical use) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70218\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70218 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-vaginal-ring/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Typical use effectiveness is lower than that for methods that are more user-independent (eg, intrauterine contraception and implants). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a non-comparative study of 2322 women from Europe and North America, the efficacy of the vaginal ring was 99.1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-vaginal-ring/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Over half of the pregnancies <span class=\"nowrap\">(11/21)</span> were attributable to compliance violations. North American women experienced more pregnancies than European women, perhaps because a greater percentage of North American women were new contraceptive users instead of switching from another method (59 versus 38 percent) and more North American women reported they removed the ring during intercourse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized trial in college students found that those assigned to the vaginal ring reported more perfect use in the first two months compared to OC users, but differences were not statistically significant in the third month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-vaginal-ring/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p/><p>Theoretically, contraceptive efficacy of combined hormonal contraceptives may be lower in obese women. Although reported failure rates appear to be similar for obese and non-obese women, data in obese women are limited to small studies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contraception-counseling-for-obese-women#H28036443\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contraception counseling for obese women&quot;, section on 'Contraceptive ring'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28791966\"><span class=\"h1\">ADMINISTRATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vaginal ring requires a prescription, but does not need to be fitted. It is available in one size and is self-administered (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F85785\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef85785 \">picture 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16531250\"><span class=\"h2\">Candidates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who desire highly effective, reversible, non-coitally-dependent contraception and who have no contraindications to taking estrogen or progestins are candidates for the vaginal ring. The <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/contraception/pdf/summary-chart-us-medical-eligibility-criteria_508tagged.pdf&amp;token=jEVGVo6WqsDq698K1C6vDPPjIqTfzg54vW4qWS3doblDMO+X3NN/ro6R0xwK/I6IOwBh6DyNhV/q6vrv3T8nCaRCrZsEC+Wz9FPYFmXFzWEhd9uzeVTKQGeWKf6mT23Z1X5qsRVoFq27I5l+8ZoObQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=16682\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a> have assessed the risk of using estrogen-progestin contraceptives in women with various medical conditions and personal characteristics. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-use-of-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives#H3033285\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the use of estrogen-progestin contraceptives&quot;, section on 'Contraindications'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13060944\"><span class=\"h3\">Adolescents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vaginal ring is a good option for adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-vaginal-ring/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Use of vaginal ring can be more private than oral contraceptives (OCs) and the transdermal patch. Depomedroxyprogesterone acetate, a progestin-only injectable, affords the same privacy, and is a popular method for adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-vaginal-ring/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The vaginal ring, however, offers the benefits of a combined hormonal method: shorter, lighter, and less painful periods, no association with weight gain, and no adverse effect on bone mineral density.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H495210707\"><span class=\"h3\">Postpartum and postabortion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-contraception-initiation-and-methods\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum contraception: Initiation and methods&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16531257\"><span class=\"h2\">Initiation and use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ideally, blood pressure should be measured before initiation of combined hormonal contraceptives; physical examination and laboratory tests are not necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-vaginal-ring/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, in settings where access to health care is limited, it is reasonable to initiate use of the ring without blood pressure documentation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-use-of-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the use of estrogen-progestin contraceptives&quot;, section on 'Screening requirements'</a>.) </p><p>Initiation of the method on the first day of menses provides assurance that the woman is not pregnant, but can be inconvenient. Alternatively, new contraception users can start the method at any point in the menstrual cycle (quick start method), as long as pregnancy is reasonably excluded (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F67567\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67567 \">table 2</a>). The manufacturer recommends using a back-up method if the ring is inserted any time other than the first day of menses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-vaginal-ring/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], while the CDC recommends back-up if it is inserted &gt;5 days from the beginning of menstrual bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-vaginal-ring/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In contrast to OCs, there is some evidence that ring insertion initiated as many as 10 days after the beginning of the last menstrual period does not compromise ovulation inhibition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-vaginal-ring/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>If the date of last menses is uncertain, a back-up method (condoms) should be used for the first seven days of ring use. A pregnancy test can be obtained two to three weeks after initiating the ring if needed to exclude pregnancy. A regimen for switching between contraceptive methods is shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F77410\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77410 \">table 3</a>). </p><p>To insert, the woman should choose a comfortable position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F85977\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef85977 \">figure 1</a>). The sides of the ring are pressed together and then it is inserted into the vagina as high as possible for comfort and to prevent it from falling out (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F85546\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef85546 \">figure 2</a>). The position of the ring does not affect contraceptive efficacy.</p><p>The ring is left in place for three weeks and then removed for a single ring-free week to allow withdrawal bleeding. During the three weeks of use, women should periodically check to ensure the ring is in place, although the optimal timing or frequency is not known [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-vaginal-ring/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. To begin a new cycle, a new ring should be inserted on the same day of the week that the old ring was removed the previous week (ie, if the ring was removed on a Monday, a new ring should be inserted on the following Monday).</p><p>If the ring remains in place more than 3 but &le;5 weeks, it is removed and a new one is inserted after a one-week ring-free interval; if the ring is left in place for &gt;5 weeks, back-up contraception is recommended until a new ring has been in place for seven days. As discussed above, the ring remains effective when left in place for up to five weeks, as the ring contains sufficient steroids to maintain stable blood concentrations for this period of time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-vaginal-ring/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Thus, inhibition of ovulation is sufficiently maintained if a woman forgets to remove the ring after the usual three-week use period. In 2013, the US Selected Practice Recommendations for Contraceptive Use published an algorithm for counseling patients who delay insertion or reinsertion of the ring (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F89824\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef89824 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-vaginal-ring/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Women who desire fewer days of withdrawal bleeding and are willing to tolerate some spotting can safely use an extended ring regimen whereby the ring is changed every three weeks, omitting the hormone-free week for up to one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-vaginal-ring/abstract/19-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-23</a>]. Extended use is effective and does not worsen bothersome side effects, except for unscheduled bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-vaginal-ring/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H13060600\" class=\"local\">'Unscheduled bleeding'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H241440395\"><span class=\"h2\">Reinsertion after unintended removal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unplanned removal or expulsion of the contraceptive ring can occur. The ring should not be removed during intercourse. If it accidentally falls out, it may be rinsed with cool or warm (not hot) water and reinserted into the vagina within three hours. </p><p>If the ring is out of the vagina for more than three consecutive hours, subsequent steps depend on the week of the cycle that the ring is out [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-vaginal-ring/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the first two weeks of the cycle, the ring is reinserted as soon as possible. Pregnancy may not be prevented if the ring is out for more than three hours during this time, so an additional form of contraception, such as condoms with spermicide, is used until the reinserted ring has been in place for seven continuous days. The ring should subsequently be removed according to the original schedule, after which the woman can expect to have her normal period.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During week three of the cycle, the woman discards the ring. She then chooses one of two different restart options:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Option one &ndash; Insert a new ring and begin a new three-week cycle. Back-up contraception or abstinence is recommended until the new ring has been used continuously for seven days. The woman may not have a regular period until she reaches her next ring-free week, but she may have vaginal spotting or bleeding prior to that point. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Option two &ndash; This option is only used if the prior ring was in place for seven consecutive days. Leave the ring out for up to seven days. During this ring-free time the woman may have her period. By day seven, insert a new ring and begin a new cycle. Back-up contraception or abstinence is recommended until the new ring has been used continuously for seven days.</p><p/><p>These steps are consistent with recommendations from the manufacturer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-vaginal-ring/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In contrast, the CDC recommendations are more liberal and state that back-up contraception is not needed if reinsertion of the current ring occurs in less than 48 hours (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F89824\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef89824 \">algorithm 1</a>). If the ring has been out of the vagina for an unknown amount of time, then pregnancy should be excluded prior to reinsertion of the ring (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F67567\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67567 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-vaginal-ring/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>There is evidence that ovulation is inhibited when the ring has been in place for only three days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-vaginal-ring/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]; however, there are no data about actual failure rates after only three days of use, so a back-up method is recommended for one week.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H495210680\"><span class=\"h2\">Follow-up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A routine follow-up examination is unnecessary, but blood pressure should be checked yearly, if possible. The woman should contact her provider if she has concerns about the method, wants to discontinue contraception or switch to another method, or has changes in health status that might affect the appropriateness of use of an estrogen-progestin contraceptive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16530872\"><span class=\"h2\">Return of fertility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After removal of the vaginal ring, resumption of ovulation is rapid, with the median time to ovulation 19 days and earliest ovulation after 13 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-vaginal-ring/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4249366877\"><span class=\"h2\">Use with other vaginal products</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The contraceptive ring can interfere with other female barrier contraceptives but not vaginal medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-vaginal-ring/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. For example, the diaphragm or female condom should be not be used as back-up contraception with the contraceptive ring. However, vaginally-dosed drugs, such as for the treatment of vaginal candidiasis or bacterial vaginosis, are compatible with the vaginal contraceptive ring. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28791973\"><span class=\"h1\">ACCEPTABILITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women find the vaginal ring a highly acceptable form of contraception because it is easy to use, remains effective if removal and reinsertion is not performed precisely on time, results in low systemic hormone levels, and is rapidly effective and reversible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28791982\"><span class=\"h2\">Satisfaction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Users of the vaginal ring report high satisfaction: 84 to 96 percent report being satisfied and 87 to 98 percent would recommend the ring to a friend [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-vaginal-ring/abstract/4,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,27,28</a>]. Women like the method&rsquo;s ease of use, once-a-month administration, and low dose of hormones (vaginal hormone delivery increases bioavailability) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-vaginal-ring/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p>Vaginal ring users are either as satisfied or more satisfied than oral contraceptive (OC) users. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one trial where 201 women were randomly assigned to three cycles of the vaginal ring or a triphasic, norgestimate-containing OC, ring users were three times more likely to be very satisfied than their OC counterparts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-vaginal-ring/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another trial that randomly assigned 983 women to 13 cycles of the vaginal ring or a drospirenone-containing OC found that both groups were satisfied with the method (84 and 87 percent, respectively) and would recommend the method to a friend (87 and 92 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-vaginal-ring/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28791989\"><span class=\"h2\">Continuation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Discontinuation of combined hormonal contraceptive methods is common. Studies show that 28 to 35 percent of women discontinue the vaginal ring before one year, with most discontinuations occurring in the first three to four cycles. Although side effects are the most commonly reported reason for discontinuing a contraceptive method, they only accounted for 11 to 30 percent of the discontinuation among ring users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-vaginal-ring/abstract/4,27-29,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,27-29,32,33</a>]. </p><p>While one randomized trial found that ring users overall were less likely to discontinue the method than OC users (12 versus 22 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-vaginal-ring/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>], another randomized trial observed no difference in discontinuation rate by method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-vaginal-ring/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A randomized trial including 201 women comparing the vaginal ring to a norgestimate-containing OC found that among women using the &ldquo;quick start&rdquo; method, ring users were less likely to discontinue than OC users (11 versus 16 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-vaginal-ring/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p>As with all hormonal contraceptives, providing or prescribing up to a one-year supply of contraception enhances convenience and continuation of the method.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3636931\"><span class=\"h2\">Adherence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adherence with the vaginal ring is similar to that with OCs. Women in clinical trials report adherence with recommended use of the vaginal ring (three weeks in, one week out) in approximately 80 to 90 percent of cycles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-vaginal-ring/abstract/29,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,32</a>]. Many women report altering use of the vaginal ring by prolonging the ring-free period (more than seven days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-vaginal-ring/abstract/4,27,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,27,35</a>] and extending use up to five weeks to regulate their cycles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-vaginal-ring/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Cultural factors may play a role, as one study showed that North American women were slightly less likely (80 versus 91 percent) than European women to use the ring as instructed (eg, failing to replace it within three hours after removal) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-vaginal-ring/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28792003\"><span class=\"h2\">Cycle control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cycle control is a benefit of all combined hormonal contraceptive methods.

Other studies have failed to support this association.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A multicenter analysis from the United States and several European sites compared VTE and arterial thromboembolism risk among new users of the ring and new users of combined OCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-vaginal-ring/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. In this study, which included over 66,000 woman-years of contraceptive use, ring users were not at greater risk of VTE or arterial thromboembolism than users of combined OCs containing a variety of progestins and low dose EE (VTE incidence for ring and OC users: 8.3 and 9.2 per 10,000 women-years, respectively; arterial thromboembolism 2.2 and 2.8 per 10,000 woman-years, respectively). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-sponsored study of the risk of several cardiovascular endpoints in combined hormonal contraceptive users analyzed data from two integrated medical care programs and two state Medicaid programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-vaginal-ring/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The authors identified 835,826 women who had at least one prescription filled for a combined hormonal contraceptive between 2001 and 2007. Outcomes evaluated included arterial thrombotic events (myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke), VTE, cardiovascular disease mortality, and total mortality. The final cohort included 23,910 person-years of exposure to ENG.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In adjusted analyses of both current and new users, ENG use was associated with a higher risk of VTE relative to other low-estrogen combined hormonal contraceptives (RR 1.56; 95% CI 1.02&ndash;2.37). As in some earlier studies, when the analysis was restricted to new users, however, there was no increased risk. Because the risk of VTE is higher among new users of any combined hormonal contraceptive, and there were likely more new users in the ENG group, the analysis combining current and new users probably underestimated the risk in the comparator group. To avoid this bias, comparisons should be made only among new users. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 15-year Danish historical cohort study evaluated data from national registries to determine the risk of arterial events, thrombotic stroke and myocardial infarction, in users of hormonal contraception compared to nonusers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-vaginal-ring/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The cohort included the entire population of Danish women, 15 to 49 years of age, for the period 1995 through 2009. During 38,246 person years of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contraceptive-vaginal-ring-ethinyl-estradiol-and-etonogestrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">contraceptive vaginal ring</a> use, the authors observed 12 thrombotic strokes (incidence 31.<span class=\"nowrap\">4/100,000</span> person years; adjusted relative risk [RR] 2.49, 95% CI 1.41-4.41). Among nonusers, the incidence of thrombotic stroke was 24.<span class=\"nowrap\">2/100,000</span> person years. Although the risk of thrombotic stroke in ring users may be increased compared with women not using hormonal contraception, it is comparable to the risk with use of all other estrogen-progestin contraceptives. The absolute risk is very small and probably acceptable to most women given the contraceptive and noncontraceptive benefits of hormonal contraception.
