In the United States, breast cancer is the most common female cancer, the second most common cause of cancer death in women, and the main cause of death in women ages 40 to 49 years. The lifetime probability of developing invasive breast cancer is one in eight.</p><p>Breast cancer is a heterogeneous, phenotypically diverse disease composed of several biologic subtypes that have distinct behavior. Amplification or overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) oncogene is present in approximately 15 percent of primary invasive breast cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-systemic-therapy-for-her2-positive-breast-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Women with early-stage breast cancer that meet criteria for HER2 positivity are treated with chemotherapy and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trastuzumab-including-biosimilars-of-trastuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trastuzumab</a> as adjuvant treatment. </p><p>This topic review will cover the use of adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trastuzumab-including-biosimilars-of-trastuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trastuzumab</a> plus chemotherapy in patients with HER2-positive early stage breast cancer (stage I to III ).

However, these patients appear to be at a higher risk of recurrence compared with similar patients with HER2-negative disease. Therefore, we treat patients with HER2-positive breast cancers that are 5 to 10 mm with adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trastuzumab-including-biosimilars-of-trastuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trastuzumab</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a>. Small tumors recur less frequently, and therefore, the absolute benefit derived from anti-HER2 therapy is likely to be less. Nevertheless, we often also treat tumors that are as small as 3 to 4 mm with these agents, especially if they are hormone receptor-negative, which portends a worse prognosis. For tumors that are 1 to 2 mm, we typically do not treat with adjuvant trastuzumab and chemotherapy, given an expected low likelihood of recurrence. In addition to the considerations above, for tumors of any size that are hormone receptor-positive, we treat with adjuvant endocrine therapy. This is generally consistent with the guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-systemic-therapy-for-her2-positive-breast-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The benefit of adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trastuzumab-including-biosimilars-of-trastuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trastuzumab</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a> in patients with small HER2-positive tumors was evaluated in a single-arm trial that demonstrated three-year recurrence-free survival rates of approximately 99 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-systemic-therapy-for-her2-positive-breast-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

In addition, most clinicians feel that the benefits of adjuvant treatment outweigh the risks of side effects (which in the trial above appeared minimal) and administer trastuzumab plus chemotherapy to this group of patients.</p><p>Several retrospective studies suggest that patients with a small HER2-positive tumor have a higher risk of relapse than HER2-negative cancers. For example [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-systemic-therapy-for-her2-positive-breast-cancer/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 2026 women with node-negative disease who underwent tissue microarray, 206 women (10 percent) were HER2-positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-systemic-therapy-for-her2-positive-breast-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Ten percent of the HER2-positive group and 17 percent in the HER2-negative group had a tumor size &lt;10 mm. The majority of women in this subset (82 percent) did not receive chemotherapy.

Trastuzumab is the only HER2-directed agent to result in a survival benefit when administered (with chemotherapy) in the adjuvant setting.

Patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-positive tumors and higher stage II or III cancers may consider one year of adjuvant neratinib after completing their year of trastuzumab-based therapy. In one randomized trial, neratinib reduced recurrence risk by 2 to 4 percent in that cohort. Side effects of neratinib include substantial risk of significant diarrhea, which may require multiple antidiarrheal agents to prevent or treat.

We also suggest adjuvant chemotherapy plus HER2-directed therapy in women with HER2-positive breast cancers 5 mm to 1 cm with no nodal involvement. We offer adjuvant chemotherapy and HER2-directed therapy for even smaller tumors (3 to 4 mm), especially if they are hormone receptor-negative. We typically do not offer adjuvant HER2-directed therapy or chemotherapy for node-negative tumors that are 1 to 2 mm in size.</p><p>We suggest that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trastuzumab-including-biosimilars-of-trastuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trastuzumab</a> be administered concomitantly with chemotherapy rather than sequentially. Although administration of trastuzumab sequentially after completion of all chemotherapy has demonstrated activity, it appears to be less effective than when given concurrently. Following completion of chemotherapy plus trastuzumab, we recommend trastuzumab as a single agent (ie, maintenance treatment) for a total treatment duration of 52 weeks. (See <a href=\"#H517953427\" class=\"local\">'Trastuzumab-based therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1133979075\" class=\"local\">'Treatment duration'</a> below.) </p><p>For those with node-positive disease or tumors &gt;2 cm, we offer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pertuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pertuzumab</a>, to be administered concomitantly with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trastuzumab-including-biosimilars-of-trastuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trastuzumab</a> for one year.

There are no data to support the use of trastuzumab plus endocrine therapy (without prior use of chemotherapy) for women with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-positive breast cancer, and we consider this approach to be investigational.
