MNT is an integral component of diabetes management and diabetes self-management education [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-considerations-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Randomized controlled trials of MNT compared with usual care (initial lifestyle consult with infrequent follow-up) have demonstrated decreases in glycated hemoglobin (A1C) of approximately 2 percent in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients and 1 percent in patients with an average four years' duration of type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-considerations-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>].</p><p>MNT for type 2 diabetes should consider five key aspects:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight management and increased physical activity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Caloric intake (balanced with caloric expenditure)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consistency in day-to-day carbohydrate intake at meals and snacks</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nutritional content</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Timing of meals and snacks</p><p/><p>Meal content, quantity, and timing are particularly important for patients who are treated with insulin secretagogues or traditional insulin regimens.</p><p>The process of MNT involves selecting an appropriate meal planning approach and educational materials based on assessment of a person's ability or willingness to learn, motivation to make changes in eating habits, clinical and nutrition goals, diabetes medications, activity level, and lifestyle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-considerations-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. MNT clinical practice guidelines recommend a series of three to four encounters with a registered dietitian lasting for 45 to 90 minutes. The series of encounters should ideally begin at diagnosis of diabetes or at first referral to a dietitian for MNT and should be completed within three to six months. The dietitian can then reassess diabetes-related outcomes and discuss with the patient whether additional MNT encounters are needed. At least one follow-up MNT encounter is recommended annually to reinforce lifestyle changes and evaluate and monitor diabetes-related outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-considerations-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4153922037\"><span class=\"h2\">Weight and caloric assessment</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2061662979\"><span class=\"h3\">Estimating body mass index</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Body mass index (BMI) is now commonly used in research and clinical care as a classification of weight status and is calculated as: weight in kg &divide; (height in m)<sup>2</sup>. The BMI can be estimated from a table or a calculator (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F63600%7EENDO%2F74762\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63600 graphicRef74762 \">table 1A-B</a>) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-body-mass-index-bmi-quetelets-index-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>).

Improved glycemic control induced by weight loss is associated with partial correction of the two major metabolic abnormalities in type 2 diabetes: insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-considerations-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Caloric restriction, even before significant weight loss, will result in short-term improvement in glycemic control. Fasting blood glucose (FBG) is largely determined by hepatic glucose output, which falls within several days of calorie restriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-considerations-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/3,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12,13</a>]. However, long-term reduction in FBG concentration depends upon weight loss; blood glucose values increase slightly when the patient resumes a weight maintenance diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-considerations-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Weight loss goals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with type 2 diabetes who are overweight (BMI &ge;25 to 29.9) or obese (BMI &ge;30), initial recommendations for weight loss and physical activity are to lose 5 to 10 percent of initial body weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-considerations-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] and to accumulate at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity over the course of most days of the week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-considerations-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Once initial weight goals are met, further goals should be determined based on assessment of the impact of the weight loss on FBG and the patient's willingness to lose more weight.</p><p>Patients need not reach ideal body weight to achieve improvement in health status, particularly if the patient engages in regular exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-considerations-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A sustained weight loss of even 5 to 10 percent of initial body weight in overweight individuals can have a lasting beneficial impact on serum glucose, dyslipidemia, and hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-considerations-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/14,15,18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15,18-20</a>]. In a randomized trial of an intensive lifestyle intervention to increase physical activity and decrease caloric intake versus standard diabetes education in people with type 2 diabetes, a modest weight loss of 8.6 percent of initial weight at one year was associated with significant improvement in blood pressure, glycemic control, FBG, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglyceride levels and significant reductions in the use of diabetes, hypertension, and lipid-lowering medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-considerations-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Patients in the lifestyle intervention were more likely to experience complete or partial remission of diabetes compared with the diabetes support and education group (11.5 percent during the first year and 7.3 percent at year 4, compared with 2 percent for the diabetes support and education group at both time points) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-considerations-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. After a median follow-up of 9.6 years, the difference in weight loss was attenuated but remained significant, and there were greater reductions in A1C and improvements in fitness and some cardiovascular risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-considerations-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Participants were coached on calorie and fat gram counting and given reference booklets. Calorie and fat gram targets were based on initial body weight and targets were selected to promote weight loss of one to two pounds per week, providing 25 to 30 percent of calories from fat and &lt;10 percent saturated fat. In Look AHEAD, the calorie and fat gram goals were as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Persons weighing less than 114 kg (250 lb):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>1200 to 1500 kcal per day, 40 to 50 g fat per day</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Persons weighing 114 kg (250 lb) or more:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>1500 to 1800 kcal per day, 50 to 60 g fat per day</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">It is important that low-calorie diets (less than 1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/day)</span> are not adopted without review to be sure nutritional needs are met.

In the Look AHEAD lifestyle intervention, use of meal replacements, which was not a randomized intervention, was associated with significantly more weight loss. Although this association does not suggest causality, it is notable that the lifestyle intervention participants with the highest meal replacement use (approximately 12 meal replacements per week) had a mean weight loss of 11.2 percent, and those with the lowest use (approximately two meal replacements per week) lost 5.9 percent of initial weight after the first year of the intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-considerations-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Meal replacements can facilitate weight loss, reduce cardiovascular risk factors, and promote effective weight loss for periods as long as four to five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-considerations-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/26,29-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,29-34</a>].

Originally, the exchange lists categorized foods into six groups: <span class=\"nowrap\">starch/bread,</span> meat and meat substitutes, vegetables, fruit, milk, and fat. Each portion of food listed within a group was &quot;exchangeable&quot; because it contained approximately the same nutritional value in terms of calories, carbohydrate, protein, and fat.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The food groups have been more recently categorized into three groups, to simplify the teaching of carbohydrate consistency concepts. These three groups are carbohydrate, meat and meat substitutes, and fat (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F52063\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52063 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F75559\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75559 \">table 4</a>). The exchange lists also identify foods that are good sources of fiber and foods that have a high sodium content.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The exchange system meal planning approach can be used as a tool to help patients achieve calorie, fat, and carbohydrate goals (see <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Carbohydrate consistency'</a> below).

Older, &quot;conventional&quot; insulin regimens, with fixed doses of short and intermediate-acting insulins, require more consistency in timing and amounts of carbohydrate intake to avoid fluctuations in glucose values. However, flexible insulin dosing regimens, incorporating a long-acting insulin to provide basal levels and a rapid-acting insulin for premeal bolus doses, allow for adjustments of insulin dose for variations in carbohydrate intake. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of insulin therapy in diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Carbohydrate consistency may also be helpful for patients with erratic blood glucose patterns, including problems with hypoglycemia. In addition, limiting carbohydrate content at meals and snacks may be sufficient to improve glycemic control for some patients who are not overweight or who are not ready to focus on losing weight. Pre- and post-meal blood glucose monitoring data can then help to determine if adjustments to carbohydrate intake at meals and snacks will be sufficient, or if medication(s) need to be combined with MNT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-considerations-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>There are several meal planning approaches to achieve carbohydrate consistency. The selection of meal planning and whether to use carbohydrate counting (basic or advanced) is tailored to the individual.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Basic carbohydrate counting</strong> &ndash; The goal of carbohydrate counting for patients with type 2 diabetes is to promote glycemic control by implementing a consistent pattern of carbohydrate consumption with meals and snacks. Patients who have been instructed in basic carbohydrate counting consume a predetermined total amount of carbohydrate proportioned throughout the day, calculated in grams of carbohydrate per food portion. The target amount of carbohydrate is usually based on nutrition goals and usual eating patterns. There is controversy about the optimal amount of carbohydrate consumption. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Nutritional content'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients need to be comfortable with simple arithmetical computations. Most patients will require specific training in carbohydrate counting, usually by a registered dietician, to set an appropriate target and learn to measure or estimate portion size (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F51729\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51729 \">table 5</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutritional-considerations-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutritional considerations in type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Basic carbohydrate counting'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Advanced carbohydrate counting</strong> &ndash; At a more advanced level, carbohydrate counting focuses on adjustment of food, insulin, and activity based on patterns from detailed logs. Patients treated with flexible insulin dosing can determine how much rapid-acting insulin is needed to cover a certain amount of carbohydrate. Pre- and post-meal blood glucose monitoring data can help to determine if the insulin dose is correct. As an example, a patient may have been told to eat 60 grams of carbohydrate with their evening meal and precede this with 4 units of rapid-acting insulin. This means that they are using 1 unit to cover every 15 grams, and they can decrease their insulin dose proportionately if they plan to eat less carbohydrate at a meal. Facility with carbohydrate counting strategies becomes essential in making these adjustments.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients vary considerably in the amount of insulin required to cover a set amount of carbohydrate; some patients need a different insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio at different meals. Once the ratio is established, patients have freedom to vary the amount of carbohydrate ingested at particular meals. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutritional-considerations-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutritional considerations in type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Advanced carbohydrate counting'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1985117374\"><span class=\"h3\">Timing of food intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Consistent timing of food intake is an important aspect of nutrition in type 2 diabetes patients treated with insulin secretagogues or traditional insulin regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-considerations-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. Insulin regimens that are based on the injection of roughly the same amount of insulin at the same time each day (twice daily premix or basal plus oral medications) require some attention to consistency in meal timing. If meal time varies widely, then blood glucose profiles will fluctuate as well, with little chance of achieving low A1C values without a substantial risk of hypoglycemia. In contrast, basal-bolus insulin regimens offer patients with type 2 diabetes who require insulin more flexibility in meal timing.</p><p>Meal timing consistency is also important for patients with type 2 diabetes who are taking oral medications that promote insulin secretion, such as sulfonylureas or meglitinides (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F56876\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56876 \">table 6</a>). The use of biguanides, thiazolidinediones, alpha-glucosidase, DPP-4 and SGLT2 inhibitors, and newer rapidly-acting insulin preparations, however, allow for more flexibility in meal schedules and content.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Nutritional content</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The impact of specific dietary composition on weight change remains uncertain.

The reverse is also true; when energy from dietary fats decreases, energy from carbohydrate or protein sources increases. The debate has mainly centered on whether low-fat or low-carbohydrate diets can better induce weight loss and sustain it over the long-term. The relative importance of other dietary factors is also unknown; these include protein, types of fat, fiber (especially soluble), acid content of foods, particle size, food processing regimens, and rate and efficiency of digestion and absorption of different nutrients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-considerations-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].

Patients with diabetes who are consuming diets higher in fat must reduce fat intake and also assure that their diet is adequate in sources of lean protein, fiber content, and essential vitamins and minerals. The type of fat consumed is critical for the prevention and treatment of CVD. Saturated fat and trans fat (hydrogenated fats) are atherogenic, while monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats (particularly omega-3 fatty acids) are protective.

The prescription must be tailored for the individual patient to further address existing or at-risk complications related to diabetes or other concomitant conditions. (See <a href=\"#H3527118355\" class=\"local\">'Goals of nutritional therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical nutrition therapy (MNT) is the process by which the nutrition prescription is tailored for people with diabetes based on medical, lifestyle, and personal factors and is an integral component of diabetes management and diabetes self-management education. The five components of MNT are weight management and physical activity, caloric intake, day-to-day carbohydrate consistency, nutritional content, and meal timing. (See <a href=\"#H1818219337\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Major emphasis should be placed on lowering caloric intake and inducing weight loss for patients with type 2 diabetes who are overweight (body mass index [BMI] &ge;25 to 29.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> and obese (BMI &ge;30). A sustained weight loss of even 5 to 10 percent of initial body weight in overweight individuals can have a lasting beneficial impact on serum glucose, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Patients who require weight loss'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical activity, diet, and behavioral modification are important components of all programs to accomplish weight loss. There are additional options for weight loss, including addition of medication to promote weight loss and bariatric surgery. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Weight loss strategies'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-overview-of-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Overview of management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although patients with type 2 diabetes are more resistant to hypoglycemia than patients with type 1 diabetes, patients who are treated with hypoglycemic medications or insulin may benefit from meal planning to achieve carbohydrate consistency. Carbohydrate consistency may also be helpful for patients with erratic blood glucose patterns, including problems with hypoglycemia. In addition, limiting carbohydrate content at meals and snacks may be sufficient to improve glycemic control for some patients who are not overweight or who are not ready to focus on losing weight. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Carbohydrate consistency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consistent timing of food intake is an important aspect of nutrition in type 2 diabetes patients treated with insulin secretagogues or traditional insulin regimens. If meal time varies widely, then blood glucose profiles will fluctuate as well, with little chance of achieving low A1C values without a substantial risk of hypoglycemia. (See <a href=\"#H1985117374\" class=\"local\">'Timing of food intake'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The impact of specific dietary composition on glycemic control and cardiovascular risk remains uncertain. The optimal macronutrient composition of the diet for patients with diabetes should be individualized, based upon weight loss goals, other metabolic needs (eg, hypertension, dyslipidemia, nephropathy), and food preferences. A diet that includes carbohydrates from fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and low-fat milk is encouraged. It is important to distinguish between types of fat in the diet, lowering saturated and avoiding hydrogenated fats, while consistently including monounsaturated and omega-3 fatty acids in the diet. Protein intake should be appropriate to medical condition. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Nutritional content'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3522257997\" class=\"local\">'Dietary recommendations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Promoting dietary compliance is a challenge, and a registered dietitian can be helpful in developing and monitoring a nutrition prescription. Compliance can be fostered by tailoring the nutrition prescription to the individual patient's preferences and lifestyle, reviewing food diaries, and giving positive feedback with improved glycemic control. (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Promoting dietary compliance'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-considerations-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Evert AB, Boucher JL, Cypress M, et al.
