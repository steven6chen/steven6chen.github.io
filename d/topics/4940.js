As with all delusions, this belief cannot be corrected by reasoning, persuasion, or logical argument. Many affected individuals are quite functional; for the minority, delusions of parasitic infection may interfere with usual activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-infestation-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Delusional infestation is a delusional disorder of the somatic type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-infestation-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], a subgroup of delusional disorders in which nonexistent disease or alteration of the body forms the basis of the disorder. Delusions of infestation are the most common form of monosymptomatic hypochondriacal psychosis; others include delusions of dysmorphism and delusions of body odor or halitosis. </p><p>This topic addresses the epidemiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis of delusional infestation.

The principal name for the disorder through approximately 2015 &quot;delusional parasitosis&quot; was introduced in 1948 in a description of 45 cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-infestation-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. More recent literature refers to delusional infestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-infestation-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>Two forms of delusional infestation are widely recognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-infestation-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]: </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15123609\"><span class=\"h3\">Primary delusional infestation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary delusional infestation is a psychiatric disorder with the delusion of parasitic infection as its only manifestation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15123616\"><span class=\"h3\">Secondary delusional infestation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Secondary delusional infestation is a symptom rather than a disorder. The delusion of infestation occurs secondarily to another psychiatric disorder or to a medical illness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1570879\"><span class=\"h2\">Morgellons</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Morgellons is a syndrome characterized by symptoms that appear to be identical to delusional infestation or very similar, but with the addition of the affected patient&rsquo;s beliefs that inanimate objects (such as colored strings or fibers) were present in the lesion as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-infestation-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. </p><p>Morgellons was named and described in 1674 by Sir Thomas Browne [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-infestation-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The term &quot;Morgellons disease&quot; has been adopted by an active online community of patients and family members who believe that this unexplained dermopathy is a poorly diagnosed infectious disease and dispute an underlying psychological basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-infestation-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. An association between borreliosis and Morgellons disease has been proposed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-of-lyme-disease#H342592788\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology of Lyme disease&quot;, section on 'Borrelia proteins'</a>.)</p><p>The etiology and diagnosis of Morgellons is controversial. Multiple studies published between 2013 and 2015, largely from a single group of investigators, described histological observations and findings from electron microscopic imaging of skin samples from several patients with Morgellons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-infestation-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. The findings included the presence of spirochetes, dermal filaments comprised of keratin and collagen, and proliferation and activation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts in the epidermis. </p><p>These findings were contrary to an earlier, larger study of 115 patients with unexplained dermopathy, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-infestation-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study reported the absence of parasites and that most materials collected from participants' skin were composed of cellulose, likely of cotton origin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2369942\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Delusional infestation is a rarely diagnosed disorder. It may be underestimated in the psychiatric literature because patients with delusional infestation do not believe that their symptoms are delusional and are reluctant to see a psychiatrist. The disorder is rarely seen by dermatologists as well; it has been estimated that a practicing dermatologist could expect to see one patient with delusional infestation in seven years in practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-infestation-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>A population-based study found an incidence of delusional infestation of 1.9 cases (95% CI 1.5-2.4) per 100,000 person-years among residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota from 1976 to 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-infestation-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Incident cases were identified through review of the comprehensive medical records of Olmsted County residents, the source of the Rochester Epidemiology Project [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-infestation-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The diagnosis of delusional infestation was defined as including delusional parasitosis as well as false beliefs of infestation by insects or inanimate objects. The mean age of patients at diagnosis was 61.4&nbsp;years (range of 9 to 92&nbsp;years). The incidence rate was fairly consistent in each decade of the study with a non-significant trend toward increasing over time. </p><p>A retrospective study of almost 10,500 psychiatric outpatients in China identified 86 (0.83 percent) with delusional disorders, two of whom had unspecified somatic delusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-infestation-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The prevalence of delusional infestation in southwest Germany has been estimated to be 83 cases per million population per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-infestation-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Most cases have been reported from North America and Europe, and more recently from Asia and most other world regions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H599085217\"><span class=\"h2\">Sociodemographic characteristics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A retrospective review of 147 patients diagnosed as having a delusional&nbsp;infestation identified the following sociodemographic characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-infestation-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mean age was 57 years.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Female-to-male ratio was 2.89:1.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>56 percent were married.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>33 percent were self-described as disabled, 28 percent were retired, 26 percent were employed.</p><p/><p>Other studies have also reported that delusional infestation appears to be more common in patients older than 50 years of age and in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-infestation-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/19,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21</a>], whereas some studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-infestation-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>] have found a majority of patients to be unmarried. In one series, 54 percent of patients were evaluated as &quot;socially isolated&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-infestation-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Social isolation appeared to be a premorbid state rather than a consequence of illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-infestation-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. A higher than expected prevalence of personality disorders has also been observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-infestation-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/15,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H803249916\"><span class=\"h2\">Morgellons</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An epidemiologic study sponsored by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported on 115 patients (3.7 patients per 100,000 health plan enrollees) with unexplained skin lesions or skin sensations accompanied by patient-reported fibers or other inanimate materials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-infestation-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Skin lesions were found to be most consistent with chronic excoriations or arthropod bites. No common underlying infection or other physical cause for the condition was found, similar to findings from studies of the more commonly recognized &quot;delusional infestation.&quot; Seventy percent of the patients in the CDC sample additionally had chronic fatigue and 63 percent had clinically significant somatic complaints. (See <a href=\"#H1570879\" class=\"local\">'Morgellons'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H803249889\"><span class=\"h2\">Comorbidity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A series of 54 patients with a delusional infestation of parasites and inanimate objects found that 74 percent had an additional, co-occurring psychiatric disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-infestation-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The sample was limited to patients who were willing to undergo a psychiatric examination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of delusional infestation is unknown.</p><p>One theory for the development of somatoform-type disorders is that common, distressing somatic symptoms become amplified and perpetuated following the patient's new awareness of a known disease through another individual, the media, or publicity by public health agencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-infestation-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. As an example, many individuals may experience fleeting pruritus following an encounter with an individual with scabies. For a small proportion of them, prone to hypochondriacal worry or a somatic delusion, the pruritus might worsen as they learn more about scabies. The reasons for this amplification are unclear. Patients may also misinterpret new sensations or symptoms to which they were previously oblivious, reaffirming their belief that they must be sick, and perpetuating the cycle. Stress induced by the severity of the perceived illness may further augment symptoms.</p><p>It has also been proposed that delusional infestation may be related to an excess of extracellular dopamine within the striatum of the brain due to decreased functioning of the dopamine transporter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-infestation-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Response of many patients to the dopamine antagonist <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pimozide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pimozide</a> lends some support to this theory.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients commonly present for general medical or dermatologic care (rather than psychiatric care) with a fixed, false belief of infestation. They typically describe pruritus and frequently have excoriations from scratching. They often have a history of dermatologic complaints, including rashes, pruritus, and sensations of stinging, biting, and formication (a feeling that bugs are crawling on the skin) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-infestation-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/19,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,27</a>]. The onset is usually insidious, and most patients have symptoms for at least six months, and some many years, before the diagnosis is established.</p><p>Patients typically have a history of prior negative evaluations by dermatologists and general medical physicians, and in some cases have consulted entomologists. They may have received repeated courses of dermatologic and anti-parasitic therapies, despite the lack of an objective diagnosis. Those who attribute their illness to household pets may have visited veterinarians repeatedly, seeking treatment for their pets. Patients often bring in specimens for examination, which they have picked from their skin and may include scabs or cloth fibers, but do not include parasites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-infestation-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Often, they have already rejected the possibility of a psychiatric cause and refused to see a psychiatrist. </p><p>Patients may provide bizarre and unlikely stories concerning their infestation, including exhaustive descriptions of the parasite's appearance, habitat, reproductive cycle, and points of body entry and egress. Many have repeatedly had exterminators into their homes, and have sprayed themselves and their homes with potentially toxic pesticides. Some sufferers may move or rid themselves of their personal belongings in the hopes of ending the problem.</p><p>Other persons may be drawn into the patient's delusional system; 8 to 25 percent of delusions of infestation in several samples are shared [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-infestation-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/15,24,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,24,30,31</a>], most often with one other person (ie, a folie &agrave; deux) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-infestation-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Sufferers of delusional infestation generally have intact mental function and otherwise normal behavior. Their delusions are limited in scope. Many affected individuals are quite functional; for the minority, delusions of parasitic infection may interfere with usual activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-infestation-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Patients with primary delusional infestation do not generally have an antecedent history of psychiatric illness. Delusions may be preceded by an event in which possible exposure to parasites may have occurred such as sleeping in unclean bed sheets, borrowing clothing, or travel to and receipt of gifts from exotic destinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-infestation-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,32,33</a>]. However, documented parasitic infections predate the development of delusional infestation in only 2 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-infestation-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Younger patients with delusional infestation may be more likely to have the secondary form of the disorder, with underlying causes being, most notably, head injuries, substance abuse, and schizophrenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-infestation-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/15,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,34</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H336726069\" class=\"local\">'Secondary delusional infestation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2370428\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A thorough history, including health risk factors, review of systems, and use of prescription and illicit drugs should be obtained and may reveal clues to an underlying psychiatric or medical illness. The assessment also needs to rule out other psychiatric disorders and medical conditions to reach a diagnosis of primary delusional infestation. </p><p>Physical examination is often unrevealing apart from ulcers, excoriations, and scars that result from attempts to remove the organisms using fingernails, knives, pins, or other objects. Lesions may be asymmetric, particularly over the shoulders and scapulae, reflecting the increased range of the patient's dominant hand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-infestation-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Contact or irritant dermatitis resulting from excessive cleaning or the use of abrasive soaps or chemicals may be present. </p><p>Medical evaluation to rule out a true parasitic infection includes: (See <a href=\"#H55042852\" class=\"local\">'Parasitosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inquiry about travel, especially to developing countries, and exposure to an infected individual (scabies) or to an infested environment (bed bugs, animal or bird mites).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A complete blood count with differential, to look for eosinophilia. An absolute eosinophil count is not required if one can calculate this by multiplying the percentage of eosinophils by the total white blood cell count. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A dermatologic evaluation to look for characteristic lesions. </p><p/><p>Evaluation by a dermatologist can also provide reassurance to the patient that his or her symptoms are being taken seriously. </p><p>Some medical causes of secondary delusional infestation may be evident from the history or physical examination (eg, hyperthyroidism, neurologic disease). Laboratory tests to evaluate causes of unexplained pruritus in the context of possible delusions may include a complete blood count and differential, electrolytes, urea, creatinine, liver function tests and enzymes, fasting blood sugar, thyroid stimulating hormone level, and B12 and folate levels. (See <a href=\"#H336726069\" class=\"local\">'Secondary delusional infestation'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syphilis-screening-and-diagnostic-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syphilis: Screening and diagnostic testing&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-and-early-hiv-infection-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute and early HIV infection: Treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dietary-assessment-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dietary assessment in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pruritus-etiology-and-patient-evaluation#H690998\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pruritus: Etiology and patient evaluation&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a>.) </p><p>Based on the individual's risk factors, additional tests such as human immunodeficiency virus serology, a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculin-skin-test-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tuberculin skin test</a>, venereal disease research laboratory or rapid plasma reagin test, a urine drug screen for substance abuse, or radiologic imaging (eg, chest radiograph, computerized tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain) may be indicated.</p><p>Patients who bring specimens should be reassured that these will be sent to a proper laboratory <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> entomologist for examination. Providing the patient with specimen bottles with preservative may avoid the argument that the &quot;parasites&quot; will be missed because of improper preservation. Skin biopsies are rarely indicated; skin scrapings may be more appropriate, and can be readily obtained during an office visit, if scabies is suspected. </p><p>Follow-up visits provide the opportunity for serial examination of the skin and allow the patient to develop trust in the clinician. Repeated assessments of the patient are helpful in determining whether the patient&rsquo;s beliefs about infestation are fixed or shakable. The patient with shakable beliefs may eventually question whether or not the problem is &quot;in his head&quot; or ask the clinician's opinion of the problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-infestation-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. To help distinguish between a shakable and fixed belief, it can be useful to ask the patient: &quot;If our investigations conclude that you do not have a parasite, how would you feel?&quot; Most delusional patients will reply that they are convinced that they have<em> </em>a parasite, where a non-delusional patient would likely express some relief. (See <a href=\"#H336726013\" class=\"local\">'Hypochondriasis'</a> below.)</p><p>Once a medical condition has been ruled out, the next step diagnostically is to differentiate between a primary delusional infestation and delusional symptoms secondary to another psychiatric disorder. A thorough psychiatric assessment is desirable. However, most patients with delusional infestation refuse to see a psychiatrist. Tact and careful strategy may lead to a successful psychiatric referral. Alternatively, the primary care clinician should consider initiating treatment for delusional infestation, with guidance from a psychiatrist as needed.</p><p>In the primary disorder, the delusion may be the only symptom present, or may be accompanied by secondary anxiety or depression. In the secondary form, a wide range of mood, anxiety, psychotic, or substance-use disorders may be present. (See <a href=\"#H15123609\" class=\"local\">'Primary delusional infestation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H336726069\" class=\"local\">'Secondary delusional infestation'</a> below.)</p><p>Further complicating the diagnosis, depression or anxiety may be present in either the primary or secondary forms of the disorder. In primary delusional infestation, the anxiety or depression is secondary, emerging after the delusion, and often evolving out of fears about infestation and concern about its impact on the patient's life. The duration of the anxiety or depression tends to be briefer than the delusion. In secondary delusional infestation, the delusion occurs concurrently with or following the onset of an anxiety disorder or depression, and may follow a parallel course.

Classified as a delusional disorder, somatic subtype in DSM-5, delusional infestation is one of a number of disorders also described as a monosymptomatic hypochondriacal psychosis. The term delusional infestation has been used to describe patients with delusions of infestation by parasites, insects, or inanimate objects. (See <a href=\"#H15123543\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2369942\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two forms of delusional infestation have been described. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Primary delusional infestation is a psychiatric disorder with the delusion of parasitic infection as its only manifestation. It is a diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out a parasitic infection and other medical and psychiatric illnesses. (See <a href=\"#H15123609\" class=\"local\">'Primary delusional infestation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Secondary delusional infestation is a symptom rather than a disorder. The delusion of infestation occurs secondarily to another psychiatric disorder or to a medical illness. (See <a href=\"#H336726069\" class=\"local\">'Secondary delusional infestation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delusional infestation can be distinguished from other psychiatric disorders. (See <a href=\"#H336725958\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hypochondriasis is a preoccupation with fears of having a serious disease despite appropriate medical evaluation and reassurance. Although patients with hypochondriasis can fear parasitic infestation, their fears are not of delusional intensity. They will acknowledge that they may not have the conditions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=somatic-symptom-disorder-assessment-and-diagnosis#H3788678462\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Somatic symptom disorder: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Terminology and DSM-5'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with primary delusional infestation can be distinguished from patients with schizophrenia by the absence of disorganized thinking or behavior. Other than functional impairment stemming from the delusion of parasitic infection, these patients generally exhibit normal behavior. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=schizophrenia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Schizophrenia in adults: Clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms of delusional infestation can occur secondarily to a wide range of psychiatric and medical illnesses, including true parasitosis. Neurological problems and substance abuse are the most common. A thorough history and physical exam, with selective laboratory testing, can exclude these conditions.
