The testicles are found inside a skin sac called the &quot;scrotum&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F68075\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68075 \">figure 1</a>). The testicles make sperm and male hormones.</p><p>Testicular cancer occurs most often in boys and men ages 15 to 35. There are different types of testicular cancer. But most cases of testicular cancer can be cured with treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H551987984\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of testicular cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first symptom of testicular cancer is often a lump or swelling in the scrotum that is not painful. Other symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A dull ache or heavy feeling in the low belly, or around the anus or scrotum</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the testicles or scrotum</p><p/><p>These symptoms can be caused by conditions that are not cancer. But if you feel a lump in your testicle, you should see your doctor or nurse as soon as possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H551987991\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for testicular cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your doctor or nurse suspects you have testicular cancer, he or she might order a testicular ultrasound. This is an imaging test that creates pictures of the inside of the testicles and can show abnormal growths. In men suspected of testicular cancer, a mass or lump seen on ultrasound can be a sign of testicular cancer.</p><p>The only way to know for sure if a man has testicular cancer is for a doctor to remove the abnormal testicle and send it to a lab to be checked for cancer. Surgery to remove a testicle is called an &quot;orchiectomy.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H551987998\"><span class=\"h1\">What is cancer staging?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For men with testicular cancer, cancer staging is a way in which doctors find out if the cancer has spread beyond the testicles to other parts of the body. Staging usually involves blood tests, CT scans, or other imaging tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H551988005\"><span class=\"h1\">How is testicular cancer treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Removing the testicle is the first part of treatment. Further treatment depends on 3 things:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The type of cancer that is found</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether or not there is a risk it could return</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether the cancer has spread outside the testicle</p><p/><p>In general, the treatment options for testicular cancer could include any of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chemotherapy</strong> &ndash; Chemotherapy is the medical term for medicines that kill cancer cells or stop them from growing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Radiation therapy</strong> &ndash; Radiation kills cancer cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Surgery</strong> &ndash; Testicular cancer is sometimes treated with surgery to remove nearby lymph nodes, which are bean-shaped internal organs. This surgery can help prevent the spread of testicular cancer in the body. A doctor might also do surgery to remove a mass in another part of the body if the cancer has spread.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>A rigorous follow-up schedule (also called active surveillance)</strong> &ndash; For men with early testicular cancer, treatment beyond removal of the testicle is not always needed. For these men, doctors sometimes recommend simply monitoring the body for changes that could indicate the return of cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H551988012\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to father a child one day?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want to father a child one day, talk with your doctor. Treatments for testicular cancer can reduce or stop sperm production. Some men choose to store their sperm before treatment so they can use it in the future to have a child.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H551988019\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment, you will be checked every so often to see if the cancer comes back. Follow-up tests usually include exams, blood tests, and imaging tests such as X-rays and CT scans.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H551988026\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens if the cancer comes back or spreads?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the cancer comes back or spreads, you might have more chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H551988033\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to follow all your doctors' instructions about visits and tests. It's also important to talk to your doctor about any side effects or problems you have during treatment.</p><p>Getting treated for testicular cancer involves making many choices, such as what treatment to have.</p><p>Always let your doctors and nurses know how you feel about a treatment. Any time you are offered a treatment, ask:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the benefits of this treatment? Is it likely to help me live longer? Will it reduce or prevent symptoms?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the downsides to this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there other options besides this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happens if I do not have this treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H551988040\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-are-clinical-trials-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What are clinical trials?
