It occurs in patients with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, typically in the setting of other microvascular complications such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and other forms of diabetic neuropathy. The patient typically presents with nausea, vomiting, early satiety, abdominal bloating or fullness, abdominal pain, and deterioration of glucose control. The vomited material may contain food that was consumed a long time before the episode, often 12 hours to a few days earlier. The delay in gastric emptying results in delayed and unpredictable delivery of nutrients from the stomach to the small intestine, leading to variable glucose absorption and fluctuating glucose levels. Diabetic gastroparesis should be considered in any patient in whom diabetic control has deteriorated without other explanation and after careful review of diet and physical activity. Restoration of glucose control requires treatment of the gastroparesis. The use of an intensive insulin regimen or an insulin pump is not likely to be effective until the gastroparesis is controlled, because the variable glucose absorption confounds efforts to calculate a true &quot;prandial&quot; dose.</p><p>The patient's medications should be reviewed to identify any agent or agents known to impair gastrointestinal (GI) motility including narcotics, anticholinergic agents, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogs, amylin analogs, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>. An upper GI series is often helpful to rule out obstruction and for the evaluation of other common upper GI problems, especially gastroesophageal reflux, which may coexist in patients with diabetic gastroparesis. Intestinal obstruction should always be ruled out.</p><p>Several tests are recommended for the evaluation of the patient suspected of having diabetic gastroparesis, including radionuclide gastric emptying studies, radiolabeled breath tests, and wireless motility capsules. None of these tests is sufficiently sensitive or specific to be reliable. The availability and use of these procedures vary from one institution to another, although a consensus recommendation has been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interactive-diabetes-case-13-deterioration-of-metabolic-control-in-a-59-year-old-man-with-type-2-diabetes-complicated-by-retinopathy-nephropathy-and-neuropathy-comment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The findings on radionuclide gastric emptying studies often do not correlate with the presence, absence, or severity of symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastroparesis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastroparesis: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Consequently, a therapeutic trial of a prokinetic agent is often the appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic choice. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Metoclopramide</a>, a dopamine antagonist and cholinergic agent, is the prokinetic agent of choice in the United States. The usual dose is 10 mg by mouth 30 minutes before meals and at bedtime, preferably as a liquid formulation. Doses up to 20 mg at these times may be given if lower doses are not effective. Typical side effects of metoclopramide include drowsiness, restlessness, dystonia, tardive dyskinesia, and Parkinson syndrome. Reductions in dose are necessary in patients with renal insufficiency. Patients with gastroparesis may not absorb oral metoclopramide predictably due to the delayed gastric emptying and other alterations in GI motility. When oral metoclopramide has failed after an adequate trial of appropriate doses for at least two weeks, subcutaneous or intravenous metoclopramide may be tried for 10 to 14 days. These parenteral routes assure adequate bioavailability. When symptoms subside, the patient's treatment can be changed to oral metoclopramide, which may then be absorbed well enough to sustain the response.</p><p>Attention to diet is essential. A program of frequent small meals with soft solids and a low-fat diet without undigestible fiber is often helpful. Liquid nutritional supplements may also be useful in selected cases. Parenteral nutrition is needed only on rare occasions.</p><p>Most patients will respond to diet and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a>. Patients who fail to respond are difficult to manage. Other prokinetic agents are sometimes used, including oral (preferably as a liquid formulation) or intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a>. This agent may improve motility and symptoms but may also cause abdominal pain and other GI symptoms, so the net benefit of its use is not clear. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=domperidone-united-states-available-via-fda-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Domperidone</a> and cisapride, other prokinetic agents, are not available on the market in the United States, because of adverse cardiovascular side effects including ventricular arrhythmias. They are available in some other countries. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-gastroparesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of gastroparesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Surgical procedures are of no proven benefit.
