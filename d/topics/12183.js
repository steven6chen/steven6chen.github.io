These include autoimmune conditions (such as rheumatoid arthritis), allergic reactions, and flares of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (also called &quot;COPD&quot;). Steroid medicines can also be given through an &quot;IV&quot; if you cannot swallow pills or you are in the hospital. An IV is a thin tube that goes into a vein.</p><p>This article is for people who need to take oral steroids for a short time. Some people need to take oral steroids for their whole life because their body does not make enough of the hormone &quot;cortisol.&quot; This is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=addisons-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: Addison's disease (The Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adrenal-insufficiency-addisons-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other steroid medicines come as inhalers, nose sprays, or creams or ointments that go on the skin. These are sometimes called &quot;corticosteroids.&quot; They are discussed in separate articles.

These medicines come as pills and liquids.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26050825\"><span class=\"h1\">What are oral steroids used for?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral steroids treat a wide variety of medical conditions. They include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn disease, or lupus </strong>&ndash; Some medical conditions happen when the body's infection-fighting system, called the &quot;immune system,&quot; attacks healthy tissues and organs. This is called an &quot;autoimmune response.&quot; Oral steroid medicines can help reduce or prevent this attack.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Asthma, COPD, or gout flare</strong> &ndash; Oral steroids are used to reduce swelling and improve breathing for people who are having a severe flare or &quot;attack&quot; of asthma or COPD. (COPD is short for &quot;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,&quot; a lung disease that makes it hard to breathe.) Oral steroids can also reduce pain and swelling in people with attacks of gout.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nausea and vomiting</strong> &ndash; Oral steroids are sometimes used with other medicines to prevent nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prevent organ rejection</strong> &ndash; Oral steroids are also used with other medicines to keep your immune system from attacking a transplanted kidney or other transplanted organ.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Severe allergic reaction</strong> &ndash; Oral steroids can be used for a short time to help with a severe allergic reaction, for example due to poison ivy. You might take a smaller dose each day for several days, and then stop.</p><p/><p>There are separate patient education articles in UpToDate that discuss the range of medical conditions treated with oral steroids. Several are listed at the end of this article. Ask your doctor or nurse for the UpToDate patient education article about your disease or condition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4006154310\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I take oral steroids?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Follow the instructions your doctor gives you. People usually take oral steroids with breakfast or another meal so the medicine does not cause an upset stomach.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26050854\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the side effects of oral steroids?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Taking oral steroids for less than 3 weeks is not likely to cause any serious side effects. Mild side effects that can happen with short-term use include upset stomach, increased appetite, and trouble sleeping. Talk to your doctor if you have any of these side effects and they bother you.</p><p>More serious effects can occur if your condition requires you to take oral steroids for a long time or at high doses. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thin skin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eye problems (such as glaucoma or cataracts)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High blood pressure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart problems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osteoporosis and other bone problems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Growth problems in children and adolescents</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High blood sugar or diabetes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Higher chance of getting infections</p><p/><p>Your doctor will give you the lowest dose for the shortest possible time. This lowers the risk of side effects. If you take steroid medicines for a long time, you will need regular exams and tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26050871\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I know about oral steroids?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Always take your steroid medicine exactly the way your doctor tells you to.</p><p>If you need to take oral steroids for more than 3 weeks, carry a card that lists the name and dose of the steroid you take. Show this card to anyone who treats you. You should also talk to your doctor or nurse to make sure you get all the vaccines you need. That's because taking steroid medicines for a long time can increase your chance of getting certain infections.</p><p>If your condition changes, or you get sick or need surgery when you have been taking oral steroids for more than 3 weeks, your doctor might adjust your dose. If you need to stop taking your steroid medicine, he or she will explain how to gradually decrease the dose. This is called &quot;tapering.&quot;</p><p>For more detailed information about your medicines, ask your doctor or nurse for information from Lexicomp available through UpToDate. The Lexicomp handouts explain how to use and store your medicines. They also list possible side effects and warn you if your medicines should not be taken with certain other medicines or foods.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26050888\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=kidney-transplant-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Kidney transplant (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplant-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Liver transplant (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=multiple-sclerosis-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Multiple sclerosis in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nausea-and-vomiting-with-cancer-treatment-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nausea and vomiting with cancer treatment (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=psoriatic-arthritis-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Psoriatic arthritis in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rheumatoid-arthritis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Rheumatoid arthritis (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=adrenal-insufficiency-addisons-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rheumatoid-arthritis-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Rheumatoid arthritis treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
