While the exact incidence is unknown, it is found in 1 to 4 percent of traumatic head injury cases, and 5 to 15 percent of autopsy series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The incidence of EDH is highest among adolescents and young adults. In observational studies, the mean age of patients with EDH is between 20 and 30 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. EDH is rare in patients older than 50 to 60 years of age.</p><p>Most cases of EDH are due to head trauma caused by traffic accidents, falls, and assaults. Skull fractures are present in 75 to 95 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>In the setting of closed head injury, the linear translation of acceleration along the diameter of the skull in the lateral direction can produce injury to veins, arteries, or brain parenchyma, resulting in subdural hematoma (SDH), EDH, or coup-countercoup contusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition, thalamic lesions and secondary brainstem injury may develop as a consequence of the mass effect produced by a large EDH or SDH.</p><p>Key differences between SDH and EDH are readily demonstrable by unenhanced computed tomography (CT) of the head. EDH does not cross sutural margins, but does cross dural attachments because it is located in the potential space between dura and skull. As a result, EDH characteristically has a lens-shaped appearance. In comparison, SDH can cross sutural margins, but is limited by dural attachments and therefore appears as a crescent-shaped extra-axial lesion.</p><p>EDH in adults is most commonly (approximately 85 percent of cases) due to arterial injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The major cause of arterial injury is trauma to the skull base with associated tearing of the middle meningeal artery as it courses through the foramen spinosum, resulting in hemorrhage over the cerebral convexity in the middle cranial fossa. In addition, EDH is occasionally found in the anterior cranial fossa, owing to rupture of the anterior meningeal artery, and rarely due to a dural arteriovenous fistula at the vertex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>In approximately 15 percent of cases, injury to one of the dural sinuses, or the confluence of sinuses in the posterior cranial fossa, proves to be the source of hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Nontraumatic acute EDH is rare. Potential etiologies include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection, coagulopathy, congenital anomalies, vascular malformations of the dura, and hemorrhagic tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complication of neurosurgical procedures</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epidural abscess, leading to pressure necrosis of meningeal vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy, sickle cell disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, open heart surgery, Paget disease of the skull, and hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-adults/abstract/7,9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9-12</a>]</p><p/><p>Postulated mechanisms of EDH during hemodialysis include fluctuations of intracranial pressure, heparin administration, hypertension in the presence of anticoagulation, and uremic platelet dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-adults/abstract/10,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with subdural hematoma (SDH), the initial presentation of EDH has a spectrum of manifestations. Severe head trauma may result in EDH with coma, while a lesser injury may produce EDH with only momentary loss of consciousness.</p><p>In some patients with acute EDH and transient loss of consciousness, there is a so-called &quot;lucid interval&quot; with recovery of consciousness, followed by deterioration over a period of hours due to continued arterial bleeding and hematoma expansion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This deterioration is typically associated with symptoms such as headache, vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, aphasia, seizures, and hemiparesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-adults/abstract/2,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,15</a>].</p><p>In a systematic review, a lucid interval followed by deterioration was observed in 456 of 963 patients (47 percent) who had surgery for EDH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A similar sequence can be seen with EDH due to venous bleeding, with the exception that the neurologic decline is typically slower, occurring over days to weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>In any of the above settings, unchecked hematoma expansion leads to elevated intracranial pressure and clinical signs, such as an ipsilateral dilated pupil (due to uncal herniation with compression of the oculomotor nerve) or the Cushing reflex (ie, hypertension, bradycardia, and respiratory <span class=\"nowrap\">depression/irregularity)</span>. Such events will culminate in brain herniation and death unless immediate decompression is undertaken.</p><p>Approximately 7 to 14 percent of traumatic intracranial EDHs occur in the posterior fossa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Such patients may present with elevated intracranial pressure due to venous sinus obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In some instances, cortical blindness is observed secondary to bioccipital dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the setting of acute head trauma, imaging serves a key role in both diagnosis and appropriate initial treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-adults/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. In addition to EDH, head trauma is a major cause of a variety of other central nervous system lesions including subdural hematoma (SDH), subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebral contusion, diffuse brain swelling, and laceration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-adults/abstract/2,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,15</a>]. Any of these injuries may coexist in a given patient following trauma, and their clinical manifestations can be difficult to distinguish. However, it is important to identify the specific nature of the lesion during initial evaluation, since potentially life-saving treatment will differ with the lesion.</p><p>Lumbar puncture is contraindicated in cases where a space-occupying lesion such as EDH is suspected, due to the risk of herniation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Head CT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Computed tomography (CT) of the head is the most widely used imaging study for acute head trauma owing to its speed, relative simplicity, and widespread availability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Most EDHs are identifiable on CT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2634665984\"><span class=\"h3\">Findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epidural blood produces a lens-shaped or biconvex pattern on head CT because its collection is limited by firm dural attachments at the cranial sutures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F60726\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60726 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-adults/abstract/1,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,20</a>].</p><p>Occasionally, heterogeneous foci of lower attenuation appear within an acute EDH. This finding of a mixed-density blood clot (or swirl sign) indicates active extravasation of blood and represents an indication for immediate surgical evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Of note, acute EDH may not be apparent on initial head CT in up to 8 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Several issues may be associated with a nondiagnostic head CT, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe anemia, which lowers the density of the hemorrhage</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe hypotension, which reduces the rate of arterial extravasation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early scanning after trauma, before enough blood has accumulated to be visible on imaging</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Venous bleeding with slow accumulation of blood</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Hematoma volume estimation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hematoma volume influences management decisions in adult patients with acute EDH because it correlates with outcome. The hematoma volume can be estimated quickly from the head CT scan by using the formula <span class=\"nowrap\">ABC/2,</span> which approximates the volume of an ellipsoid. This formula was originally used to estimate intracerebral hemorrhage volume, but can be applied to EDH as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The formula is calculated using the centimeter scale on the CT images as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A is the greatest hemorrhage diameter on the CT slice with the largest area of hemorrhage</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>B is the largest diameter 90 degrees to A on the same CT slice</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>C is the approximate number of CT slices with hemorrhage multiplied by the slice thickness in centimeters</p><p/><p>To calculate C, each CT slice with hemorrhage is visually compared with the CT slice with the largest hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. An individual hemorrhage slice is counted as one full slice for determining C if the hemorrhage area is &gt;75 percent of the area on the slice with the largest hemorrhage. A slice is counted as one-half if the hemorrhage area is approximately 25 to 75 percent of the area on the largest hemorrhage slice. The slice is not counted if the area is &lt;25 percent of the largest hemorrhage slice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Brain MRI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although head CT is more widely used, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more sensitive than head CT for the detection of intracranial hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. MRI is especially useful in the diagnosis EDH at the vertex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In most centers, MRI is an adjunct to CT in the evaluation of acute head trauma and is used for situations in which there is a strong suspicion for EDH or SDH (ie, suppressed level of consciousness or focal neurologic deficit in the setting of trauma), but no clear evidence of hematoma by CT.</p><p>The MRI signal appearance of EDH and SDH evolves over time in a manner similar to that observed in parenchymal hematoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F77358\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77358 \">image 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The acute clot is hypointense on T2-weighted images due to the presence of deoxyhemoglobin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Over subsequent weeks, deoxyhemoglobin degrades to methemoglobin, which appears bright on both T1- and T2-weighted images.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At several months, only hemosiderin remains, and the clot again becomes hypointense on the T1-weighted images.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Angiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Under unusual conditions, cerebral angiography is indicated for the evaluation of EDH. As an example, EDH located at the vertex can originate from a dural arteriovenous fistula of the middle meningeal artery. In this setting, angiography is necessary to fully evaluate the possibility of an underlying vascular lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-adults/abstract/5,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data regarding outcome after EDH are mainly from observational studies. In surgical series, mortality after EDH in adults and children is approximately 10 and 5 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The full range of outcomes is illustrated by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study that prospectively collected data for 107 consecutive patients with EDH, the overall mortality was 5 percent, and there were no deaths among patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score &ge;8 who underwent hematoma evacuation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Select patients who present in good clinical condition with small-volume EDH can be managed nonoperatively as long as they remain stable. Close observation and serial brain imaging is an important aspect of nonoperative management, since hematoma enlargement and neurologic deterioration requiring surgery may occur in such patients.</p><p>Glucocorticoid therapy is <strong>not</strong> indicated following head injury, and may be associated with increased acute mortality. This issue is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults#H33\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of elevated intracranial pressure in adults&quot;, section on 'Glucocorticoids'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Craniotomy and hematoma evacuation is the mainstay of surgical treatment of symptomatic acute EDH. When indicated, identification and ligation of the bleeding vessel must be undertaken. However, there are few data comparing different surgical techniques. Burr hole evacuation (trephination) has been used for acute EDH, and may be lifesaving if access to neurosurgical expertise is limited or likely to be delayed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Open craniotomy affords a more complete evacuation of the hematoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The decision to perform surgery in patients with acute EDH is based primarily upon the patient's neurologic status, as assessed by the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, neurologic examination and pupillary signs, and brain imaging findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The available evidence, though limited, suggests that surgery should be performed within one to two hours after head trauma, or the onset of neurologic deterioration, for comatose patients with acute EDH and signs of brain herniation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One series of patients with acute EDH compared surgery within two hours after onset of coma (n = 18) with later surgery (n = 16).

Hematoma enlargement and neurologic deterioration requiring surgery may occur in such patients, particularly in the first 8 to 36 hours after injury, and patients with temporal EDH may be at higher risk. Thus, close observation and serial brain imaging is an important aspect of nonoperative management. Supporting evidence is found in the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One series reported 74 patients with traumatic EDH and good initial clinical status (GCS score &gt;12) who were managed nonoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Neurologic deterioration occurred in 14 patients (19 percent) prompting delayed surgery.

Nontraumatic acute EDH is rare. The incidence of EDH is highest among adolescents and young adults. EDH is rare in patients older than 50 to 60 years of age. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The source of blood in EDH is most often arterial, but 15 percent of cases are due to venous bleeding. The major cause of arterial injury is trauma to the sphenoid bone with associated tearing of the middle meningeal artery, resulting in hemorrhage over the cerebral convexity in the middle cranial fossa. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical manifestations of EDH are highly variable, and include altered consciousness, headache, vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, aphasia, seizures, and hemiparesis. Some patients with acute EDH and transient loss of consciousness have a &quot;lucid interval&quot; with recovery of consciousness, followed by deterioration due to hematoma enlargement. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Head computed tomography (CT) is a fast and accurate method for the detection of acute intracranial hemorrhage. Epidural blood produces a lens-shaped pattern on head CT. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has a higher sensitivity than CT and can be useful when diagnostic uncertainty exists. In addition to EDH, head trauma may cause subdural hematoma (SDH), subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebral contusion, diffuse brain swelling, and laceration. These injuries frequently coexist following trauma. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of patients have a good recovery after EDH, but mortality in adults and children is approximately 10 and 5 percent, respectively. Factors associated with prognosis include the severity of neurologic deficits (generally quantified by the Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score), presence of pupillary abnormalities, hematoma volume, the degree of midline brain shift, and the presence and severity of associated trauma. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with focal neurologic signs or symptoms attributable to acute EDH require emergent surgical hematoma evacuation to prevent irreversible brain injury or death caused by hematoma expansion, elevated intracranial pressure, and brain herniation. Even in patients who are comatose on admission or have early signs of brain herniation, we recommend urgent surgical hematoma evacuation given the potential for recovery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For adult patients with acute EDH who are awake and have no focal neurologic deficits, management decisions are based upon the size of the hematoma and the degree of midline shift. Patients who have a small (&lt;30 cm<sup>3</sup>) hematoma with clot thickness &lt;15 mm and midline shift &lt;5 mm on brain imaging may be managed nonoperatively with close observation, while those not meeting these criteria are likely to be managed surgically. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Hematoma volume estimation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonoperative management of acute EDH requires close observation and serial brain imaging because of the risk of hematoma enlargement and neurologic deterioration that may require surgical intervention. Thus, we recommend obtaining the first follow-up head CT scan no later than six to eight hours after head injury. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H96818426\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge David Brock, MD, CIP, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Mayer S, Rowland L.
