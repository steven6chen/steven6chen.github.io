These effects are mediated by high affinity binding of the HGFs to specific receptors expressed on the surface of the target cells.</p><p>The major toxicities of the HGFs, the history of their identification, and an overview of their uses will be presented here. Their uses for specific clinical indications are presented separately.

This goal could not be achieved, however, without the early tissue culture work, which led to characterization of the hematopoietic growth factor family, and without recombinant DNA technology, which provided the genes that allowed production of purified hormones in sufficient quantities to permit interpretable in vitro and in vivo studies.</p><p>Beginning with pioneering studies in the early 1960s, it has been recognized that normal and leukemic blood progenitor cells can be propagated in semisolid culture in the presence of soluble growth factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introduction-to-recombinant-hematopoietic-growth-factors/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. These factors were originally termed colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) because of their ability to support the formation of colonies of blood cells by bone marrow cells plated in semisolid medium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introduction-to-recombinant-hematopoietic-growth-factors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>During the 1970s and 1980s, it became clear that there were multiple types of CSFs based upon the different types of colonies that grew in the presence of the different factors. This observation led to the hypothesis that the growth and differentiation of blood cells were controlled, at least in part, by exposure of progenitor cells to CSFs having different lineage specificities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introduction-to-recombinant-hematopoietic-growth-factors/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>Following the molecular cloning of the genes for many of these factors and their receptors during the 1980s and 1990s, it became possible to study in detail the structure, function, and biology of the recombinant CSFs as well as the molecular biology of their respective genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introduction-to-recombinant-hematopoietic-growth-factors/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. This analysis, along with similar work on the regulation of cells in the immune system, led to the realization that there is a large family of interacting regulatory molecules now generally known as cytokines or lymphohematopoietic cytokines, which control the hematopoietic and immune systems and integrate their responses with those of other systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introduction-to-recombinant-hematopoietic-growth-factors/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].</p><p>This interacting network of cytokines includes the interferons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introduction-to-recombinant-hematopoietic-growth-factors/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], interleukins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introduction-to-recombinant-hematopoietic-growth-factors/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], tumor necrosis factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introduction-to-recombinant-hematopoietic-growth-factors/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], and hematopoietic growth factors (including the colony-stimulating factors) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introduction-to-recombinant-hematopoietic-growth-factors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The successful cloning of the HGFs and their receptors has provided an incredible array of tools for analysis of the molecular and cellular biology of hematopoiesis, and for the production of recombinant proteins for evaluation of the biology of the various factors in vivo and in vitro (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F52024\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52024 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">IL-3</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The discovery, cloning, and expression of the gene for murine interleukin (IL)-3 (also called murine multi-CSF) presented the first opportunity to evaluate HGFs in an unambiguous fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introduction-to-recombinant-hematopoietic-growth-factors/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Sublethally irradiated mice were infused for seven days with recombinant IL-3 or control protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introduction-to-recombinant-hematopoietic-growth-factors/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The spleens of the IL-3 treated mice were much larger than those of the controls, were more cellular, and contained more progenitors of the erythroid and myeloid lineages. In contrast, bone marrow cellularity was unaffected, although progenitor content was reduced. Similar results were obtained in mice injected intraperitoneally with purified bacterially synthesized IL-3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introduction-to-recombinant-hematopoietic-growth-factors/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Other changes induced by IL-3 included 10-fold increases in blood eosinophils and two- to threefold increases in neutrophil and monocyte counts. Intraperitoneal injections resulted in six- to 15-fold increases in peritoneal macrophages with an increase in phagocytic activity.</p><p>These experiments clearly demonstrated that murine IL-3 influenced the replication and growth potential of primitive hematopoietic progenitors. They strongly suggested that the effects such hormones have on blood counts are related to their influences on progenitor function rather than peripheral blood cell kinetics. They also suggested that the function of mature cells can be altered in vivo, an effect that would be expected to decrease rather than increase the numbers of circulating phagocytes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">GM-CSF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first indication that granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) also can broadly stimulate hematopoiesis in vivo resulted from studies in which GM-CSF produced in monkey kidney cells was infused into cynomolgus macaques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introduction-to-recombinant-hematopoietic-growth-factors/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Recombinant human GM-CSF (rhGM-CSF), when injected intravenously, has an overall initial half-time of 15 to 20 minutes, clearly demonstrating that infusion of the hormone at a concentration sufficient to maintain a functional blood level could be achieved. Infusions of rhGM-CSF into normal monkeys produced large increments in all classes of leukocytes, including eosinophils, lymphocytes, and reticulocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introduction-to-recombinant-hematopoietic-growth-factors/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The blood counts rapidly fell toward baseline when the infusion was terminated.</p><p>Mice that lack GM-CSF have normal basal hematopoiesis, but develop progressive accumulation of surfactant lipids and proteins in the alveolar space, the defining characteristic of idiopathic human pulmonary alveolar proteinosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introduction-to-recombinant-hematopoietic-growth-factors/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">G-CSF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In comparison to IL-3 and GM-CSF, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) as well as erythropoietin and thrombopoietin are more lineage-specific. A primary effect of G-CSF is to promote the conversion of granulocyte colony-forming units (CFU-G) into polymorphonuclear leukocytes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F52024\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52024 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=regulation-of-myelopoiesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Regulation of myelopoiesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Mice that lack G-CSF have chronic neutropenia (20 percent to 30 percent of normal levels) and reduced bone marrow myeloid precursors and progenitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introduction-to-recombinant-hematopoietic-growth-factors/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. They also have a markedly impaired capacity to increase neutrophil and monocyte counts after infection with <em>Listeria</em> <em>monocytogenes</em>. Mice heterozygous for the null allele of G-CSF have intermediate values, suggesting a gene dose effect.</p><p>The efficacy of human G-CSF was initially evaluated in simian preclinical trials. Cynomolgus monkeys treated with two daily subcutaneous injections of purified G-CSF for 14 to 28 days showed a dose-related increase in polymorphonuclear neutrophils, with the plateau being reached after one week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introduction-to-recombinant-hematopoietic-growth-factors/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. At the intermediate dose of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> per day, total white blood cell counts of 40,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">50,000/microL</span> were achieved, and neutrophil function was enhanced.</p><p>These initial studies also evaluated two cyclophosphamide-treated animals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introduction-to-recombinant-hematopoietic-growth-factors/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. G-CSF was given either from 6 days before until 21 days after <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> or for 14 days starting 3 days after the cessation of cyclophosphamide. The neutrophil count increased dramatically by day 6 to 7 after cyclophosphamide, reaching levels of <span class=\"nowrap\">50,000/microL</span> by the tenth day. On the other hand, the control animal remained pancytopenic for three to four weeks after treatment. This type of observation provided the rationale for the administration of G-CSF or GM-CSF to patients with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.

SCN may be associated with the acquisition of somatic clonal mutations in the G-CSF receptor. Affected children, if they survive infancy and early childhood, are at risk for myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia; registry data suggest that the incidence of these complications in the G-CSF therapy era is 9.3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introduction-to-recombinant-hematopoietic-growth-factors/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>]. It has been speculated that G-CSF therapy might increase the risk of acute myeloid leukemia, perhaps more likely in those patients with G-CSF receptor mutations that can transduce a proliferative but not a differentiation signal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introduction-to-recombinant-hematopoietic-growth-factors/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. At present, however, there is no evidence to support this hypothesis, as acute myeloid leukemia also occurs in patients who are untreated.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells#H10150103\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sources of hematopoietic stem cells&quot;, section on 'PBPC mobilization'</a>.)</p><p>A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that control stem cell trafficking would potentially allow specific manipulation of these events. The importance of VLA-4, expressed on progenitor cells, and its receptor VCAM-1, expressed by stromal cells, in the localization of stem cells to the marrow may be important in this regard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introduction-to-recombinant-hematopoietic-growth-factors/abstract/88-90\" class=\"abstract_t\">88-90</a>]. Antibodies to these molecules show that they play a role in the homing of stem cells to the marrow and in the mobilization of <span class=\"nowrap\">stem/progenitor</span> cells from bone marrow to blood, an active mechanism that appears to require signaling through the stem cell factor (SCF) receptor Kit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introduction-to-recombinant-hematopoietic-growth-factors/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>].</p><p>Another approach is the possible manipulation of self-renewal. As an example, murine bone marrow cells engineered to overexpress HOXB4 by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer show a dramatic upregulation in stem cell activity both in vitro and in vivo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introduction-to-recombinant-hematopoietic-growth-factors/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. Serial transplantation studies have revealed a greatly enhanced ability of HOXB4-transduced bone marrow cells to regenerate the most primitive hematopoietic stem cell compartment, resulting in 50-fold higher numbers of transplantable totipotent hematopoietic stem cells in primary and secondary recipients, compared with serially passaged control cells. It is possible that overexpression of other transcription factors that drive hematopoietic development might allow stem cell division to be more successfully manipulated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">EPO mimetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An additional area that holds great promise for future manipulation of the hematopoietic system is the development of small molecules, peptides, or agonistic antibodies that bind to specific receptors, with the objective of finding high affinity second generation drugs that may either be developed into oral agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introduction-to-recombinant-hematopoietic-growth-factors/abstract/25,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,93</a>] or generate molecules with longer-lasting activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introduction-to-recombinant-hematopoietic-growth-factors/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progress has been made in the identification of 13 and 14 amino acid EPO mimetic peptides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introduction-to-recombinant-hematopoietic-growth-factors/abstract/95-97\" class=\"abstract_t\">95-97</a>], whose activity can be markedly increased by the construction of covalent dimers of the peptide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introduction-to-recombinant-hematopoietic-growth-factors/abstract/98-100\" class=\"abstract_t\">98-100</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One of these agents, peginesatide (hematide, AF-37702, Omontys), was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of anemia in adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are receiving dialysis; however, this product was subsequently withdrawn from the market due to hypersensitivity reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introduction-to-recombinant-hematopoietic-growth-factors/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continuous erythropoietin receptor activator (CERA) is a chemically synthesized &quot;continuous&quot; EPO receptor activator that differs from EPO.

Inhibition of prolyl hydroxylase stabilizes hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1&alpha;), a factor important for EPO transcription; it also affects other iron homeostatic genes, lowering hepcidin and ferritin levels, which may obviate the need for concurrent iron therapy.
