While some antineoplastic agent-induced ADRs are potentially preventable (particularly those that are related to cumulative dosing), many are idiosyncratic and unpredictable.</p><p>Increasingly, cancer treatment is selected based upon an individual tumor's molecular features, a practice termed molecularly targeted therapy. Examples include use of the monoclonal antibody <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trastuzumab-including-biosimilars-of-trastuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trastuzumab</a> for breast cancers that over-express HER2; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a>, a tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitor, for gastrointestinal stromal tumors with mutations in the KIT receptor TK, as well as chronic myelogenous leukemia (where the target is the Bcr-Abl fusion protein); and anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetuximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetuximab</a> for metastatic colorectal tumors lacking mutations in the K ras oncogene. Many of these agents are associated with lung toxicity.</p><p>This topic review will provide an overview of the incidence and specific patterns of lung toxicity seen with molecularly targeted agents used for cancer therapy. A general discussion of the clinical presentation, pathogenesis, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and treatment of pulmonary toxicity associated with the use of antineoplastic agents is covered separately, as is lung toxicity associated with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy agents.

They are primarily used in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). </p><p>Approximately 1 percent of patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gefitinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gefitinib</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erlotinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erlotinib</a> and 3 percent of patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osimertinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">osimertinib</a> develop lung toxicity, usually within the first two to three months of therapy. The risk is higher in patients with preexisting lung disease and in smokers. Approximately one-third of patients who develop interstitial lung disease (ILD) while being treated with gefitinib die of this complication. The mortality rate among patients receiving osimertinib appears to be lower; in one review of 813 cases, 27 developed <span class=\"nowrap\">ILD/pneumonitis,</span> and 4 cases (15 percent of the total) were fatal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-toxicity-associated-with-antineoplastic-therapy-molecularly-targeted-agents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The mortality rate in patients who develop ILD while receiving erlotinib is not well characterized but is likely similar to gefitinib, based on available information. </p><p>The mechanism underlying pulmonary toxicity with these agents is unclear. EGFR is expressed on type II pneumocytes and involved in alveolar wall repair. EGFR TK inhibitors, by interrupting alveolar repair mechanisms, may potentiate the effect of lung injury due to other causes, including sepsis, radiation therapy, prior lung injury, and other medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-toxicity-associated-with-antineoplastic-therapy-molecularly-targeted-agents/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>].

Older age, poor performance status, smoking, a recent diagnosis of NSCLC, preexisting chronic ILD with extensive infiltrates on CT, and concurrent cardiac disease all increased the risk for ILD. A prior history of fibrotic lung disease or concurrent chest irradiation may also be aggravating factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-toxicity-associated-with-antineoplastic-therapy-molecularly-targeted-agents/abstract/5,6,10,17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,10,17-20</a>]. An interaction between smoking and gender was suggested in an analysis of 1976 Japanese patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gefitinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gefitinib</a> for NSCLC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-toxicity-associated-with-antineoplastic-therapy-molecularly-targeted-agents/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The prevalence of ILD in smokers was different in women compared with men (3.3 versus 6.6 percent).</p><p>In a postmarketing analysis of 50,000 patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gefitinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gefitinib</a> for NSCLC, 408 cases of ILD were identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-toxicity-associated-with-antineoplastic-therapy-molecularly-targeted-agents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The most common presentation was acute dyspnea with or without cough or low grade fever. Symptoms often became severe within a short time, and hospitalization was required. The median time to onset of symptoms was 24 to 31 days in Japanese and 42 days in American patients. One-third of cases were fatal.</p><p>Radiographic appearance was assessed in a study of 70 patients with confirmed gefitinib-induced lung toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-toxicity-associated-with-antineoplastic-therapy-molecularly-targeted-agents/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. There were four predominant patterns on CT scan: non-specific ground glass opacities (n = 29), multifocal areas of airspace consolidation (n = 7), patchy ground-glass infiltrates with septal thickening (n = 3), and extensive ground-glass infiltrates or airspace consolidation with traction bronchiectasis (n = 20) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-toxicity-associated-with-antineoplastic-therapy-molecularly-targeted-agents/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The remaining 11 patients had nonspecific radiographic findings.</p><p>The pattern, distribution, and extent of the findings correlated with outcomes. Overall, 31 of the 70 patients died (44 percent), and the mortality was especially high (75 percent) among patients with extensive ground-glass infiltrates or airspace consolidation, a finding that is thought to reflect diffuse alveolar damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-toxicity-associated-with-antineoplastic-therapy-molecularly-targeted-agents/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Among the cases that have been subject to biopsy, the most common histologic patterns are diffuse alveolar damage, interstitial inflammation with and without fibrosis, and organizing pneumonia; alveolar hemorrhage has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-toxicity-associated-with-antineoplastic-therapy-molecularly-targeted-agents/abstract/12,16,17,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,16,17,19</a>].</p><p>Treatment is largely supportive, with immediate and permanent discontinuation of the drug.

In placebo-controlled randomized trials of erlotinib in advanced NSCLC, rates of cough, dyspnea, and ILD have been similar in the erlotinib and control groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-toxicity-associated-with-antineoplastic-therapy-molecularly-targeted-agents/abstract/26,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,29</a>]. However, ILD may have been underdiagnosed for several reasons. ILD requires diagnostic testing, which may not have been undertaken in patients who developed respiratory symptoms during antineoplastic therapy, possibly because they were assumed to be due to advanced NSCLC. Furthermore, it can be difficult to distinguish progressive cancer, particularly of the lepidic adenocarcinoma variant (previously called bronchoalveolar carcinoma) subtype, from drug-induced ILD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-lung-malignancies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of lung malignancies&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Whether the concurrent use of cytotoxic chemotherapy and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erlotinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erlotinib</a> increases the risk of ILD is also unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-toxicity-associated-with-antineoplastic-therapy-molecularly-targeted-agents/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-toxicity-associated-with-systemic-antineoplastic-therapy-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-treatment#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary toxicity associated with systemic antineoplastic therapy: Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no clearly defined criteria for drug-induced lung disease. Because signs and symptoms are generally non-specific, the diagnosis usually remains one of exclusion. A presumptive diagnosis can be made when pneumonitis develops shortly after the initiation of treatment, an alternative explanation for the respiratory compromise is lacking, and the pneumonitis resolves soon after withdrawal of the presumed agent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> after glucocorticoid treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-toxicity-associated-with-antineoplastic-therapy-molecularly-targeted-agents/abstract/128\" class=\"abstract_t\">128</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who develop lung toxicity during treatment with a molecularly targeted agent, the decision to continue treatment, interrupt therapy, or switch to an alternative agent must be carefully considered based upon the clinical circumstances, and the nature and severity of the pulmonary toxicity. In general, suspicion of significant lung toxicity justifies discontinuation of the drug.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No specific treatment has proven effective besides discontinuation of the suspected offending agent. The use of glucocorticoids is often recommended in the more severe cases, but based upon anecdotal reports. Although the risk of opportunistic infection may be slightly increased, a short course of high-dose glucocorticoids is often considered appropriate in these situations.
