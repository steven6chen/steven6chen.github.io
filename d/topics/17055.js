The acute chest syndrome (ACS) is one of the acute pulmonary complications seen in patients with SCD. ACS is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and its prevention would reduce the death rate and sequelae in patients with SCD.</p><p>The etiology, diagnosis, and management of ACS in children and adolescents will be reviewed here. ACS in adults, and other pulmonary manifestations of SCD in adults and children, are discussed separately.

In a report from the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD), the peak incidence for ACS was in children between two and four years of age (25.3 per 100 patient-years among children with hemoglobin SS), with a higher prevalence during the winter months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-acute-chest-syndrome-in-children-and-adolescents-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>For patients with SCD, ACS is the second most common cause of hospitalization (second to vaso-occlusive pain) with a reported rate of 12.8 hospitalizations per 100 patient years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-acute-chest-syndrome-in-children-and-adolescents-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It is the most common cause of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-acute-chest-syndrome-in-children-and-adolescents-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], with one-fourth of SCD-related deaths due to ACS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-acute-chest-syndrome-in-children-and-adolescents-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In a report from the CSSCD, the death rate in patients with ACS is 1.8 percent in children and 4.3 percent in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-acute-chest-syndrome-in-children-and-adolescents-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Nearly half of patients with ACS develop this disorder during hospitalization for another complication of SCD, most frequently vaso-occlusive crisis. Other causes of hypoxia during hospitalization that can precipitate ACS include postoperative atelectasis and bronchospasm due to asthma.</p><p>A study from the Dallas Newborn Cohort demonstrated that ACS in the first three years of life significantly increased the odds of more frequent episodes of ACS during childhood (OR 2.5; 95% CI 1.7-3.9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-acute-chest-syndrome-in-children-and-adolescents-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The incidence of ACS is inversely proportional to the concentration of fetal hemoglobin and the degree of anemia, and directly proportional to the steady state white blood cell count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-acute-chest-syndrome-in-children-and-adolescents-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>]. ACS is more likely to occur in children with a history of asthma (RR 1.60; 95% CI 1.03-2.74) or exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the home (RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.09-2.74) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-acute-chest-syndrome-in-children-and-adolescents-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of acute pulmonary disease in SCD is complex, and the establishment of a specific cause in any single case is difficult. Within the pulmonary vasculature, a variety of inciting events triggers deoxygenation of hemoglobin S (Hgb S) leading to Hgb S polymerization and sickling of the red blood cell that results in vaso-occlusion, ischemia, and endothelial injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-acute-chest-syndrome-in-children-and-adolescents-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Multiple factors may be present and contribute to ACS including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammation secondary to infection or fat embolus from necrotic bone marrow leading to alveolar hypoxia and subsequent local hypoxemia with obstruction of smaller airways, collapse of distal air spaces, air trapping, and altered ventilation-perfusion relationships.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regional alveolar hypoxia from atelectasis, pulmonary edema, bronchospasm, pain from vaso-occlusive crisis involving the rib, spine or abdomen leading to local <span class=\"nowrap\">ventilation/perfusion</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(V/Q)</span> mismatch, or the administration of excessive opioid therapy. In a study of 102 children with SCD who underwent pulmonary function testing, patients with obstructive lung disease had twice the rate of hospitalizations for pain or ACS as compared with those with restrictive disease (2.5 versus 1.2 hospitalizations) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-acute-chest-syndrome-in-children-and-adolescents-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endothelial dysfunction of the pulmonary microvasculature with increased expression of vascular adhesion molecules, increased platelet and plasma coagulation activation, and disordered nitric oxide metabolism leading to thromboembolism <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hemolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-acute-chest-syndrome-in-children-and-adolescents-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p/><p>Recurrent episodes of ACS may lead to repeated lung infarctions and parenchymal fibrosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In about 40 percent of cases, a specific cause of ACS can be determined. This was illustrated by a prospective report from the National Acute Chest Syndrome Study Group (NACSSG) that evaluated 671 episodes of ACS in 538 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-acute-chest-syndrome-in-children-and-adolescents-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Definite etiology was established in 38 percent of episodes after an extensive evaluation that included bronchial or sputum cultures, blood cultures, serologic assay for mycoplasma pneumoniae, parvovirus B19, and Epstein-Barr virus, and in patients who had bronchoscopy, histologic analysis for alveolar lipid-laden macrophages. Infection was the most common cause (29 percent of all episodes) followed by pulmonary infarction (16 percent) and fat embolism (9 percent). In 46 percent of episodes, data were incomplete, and no diagnosis was established.</p><p>The following distribution was noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unknown cause &ndash; 46 percent overall and 30 percent in patients with complete data</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary infarction &ndash; 16 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fat embolism, with or without infection &ndash; 9 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chlamydia pneumoniae infection &ndash; 7 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection &ndash; 7 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Viral infection &ndash; 6 percent (eg, respiratory syncytial virus, parvovirus, rhinovirus)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mixed infections &ndash; 4 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other pathogens &ndash; 1 percent</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children below nine years of age, infection is a more common etiology for ACS than in older children or adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-acute-chest-syndrome-in-children-and-adolescents-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Infectious agents may be either viral or bacterial. The prevalence of different infectious agents depends on the age of the patient, as illustrated in the previously mentioned NACSSG study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-acute-chest-syndrome-in-children-and-adolescents-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children &le;9 years of age &ndash; In this age group, there were 329 total episodes of ACS, and 35 percent were due to infections.

In these patients, the most common cause of infection was chlamydia (30 percent) followed by mycoplasma (21 percent), respiratory syncytial virus (10 percent), staphylococcus aureus (4 percent), and streptococcus pneumoniae (3 percent).</p><p>Febrile patients with bacteremia may be at risk for ACS. In one study, 26 percent of febrile children with SCD and positive blood cultures developed ACS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-acute-chest-syndrome-in-children-and-adolescents-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Vaso-occlusive pain episode</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data from the NACSSG demonstrated that almost half of all patients who develop ACS were initially admitted for other reasons, frequently with vaso-occlusive pain episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-acute-chest-syndrome-in-children-and-adolescents-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Patients with vaso-occlusive pain are at risk for hypoventilation resulting in hypoxemia due to local pain and the administration of opioid therapy. In particular, pain in the spine, ribs, and abdomen leads to hypoventilation with alveolar hypoxia, with decreased tidal volume, development of atelectasis, and <span class=\"nowrap\">ventilation/perfusion</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(V/Q)</span> mismatch. The subsequent regional drop in arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) results in further sickling of red blood cells.</p><p>There are no clinical tests to predict which patients with vaso-occlusive pain are at risk for ACS. Secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) have been proposed as possible laboratory markers, as they both rise hours before the development of ACS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-acute-chest-syndrome-in-children-and-adolescents-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. In one small unblinded randomized trial of patients with SCD-associated pain and an elevated sPLA2, the addition of single transfusion to standard therapy compared to standard therapy alone appeared to reduce the risk of developing ACS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-acute-chest-syndrome-in-children-and-adolescents-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, in one multicenter study, elevation of sPLA2 only predicted 80 percent of patients with ACS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-acute-chest-syndrome-in-children-and-adolescents-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Further studies are needed to confirm whether sPLA2 or serum CRP will be a reliable predictor of ACS, and whether therapeutic interventions based upon these test results can prevent ACS.</p><p>In patients with SCD, pulmonary infarction can be due to vaso-occlusion, intrapulmonary sickling, or pulmonary embolus. As such, if pulmonary infarction appears to be present, lack of radiographic evidence of a deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolus does not eliminate the possibility of infarction as a cause of ACS.</p><p>In children who initially present with vaso-occlusive pain without pulmonary symptoms and who have normal chest radiographs, clinicians must be alert to clinical changes (eg, increased sedation with hypoventilation and dropping oxygen saturation monitored by pulse oximetry, new pulmonary symptoms or findings) and laboratory findings (eg, dropping hemoglobin concentration) that are associated with an increased risk of developing ACS. In these settings, there should be a low threshold for obtaining subsequent chest radiographs.

Therefore, it is important to diagnose and effectively treat asthma in patients with SCD. The challenge is that the clinical and laboratory features for determining whether a patient with SCD has clinically significant airway hyperreactivity are not well defined. Clinicians should be alert for evidence of airway hyperreactivity in patients with SCD, and should pursue further testing of children with allergic symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> recurrent ACS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-acute-chest-syndrome-in-children-and-adolescents-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

In patients with ACS and progressive respiratory difficulty where the cause remains obscure, the possibility of pulmonary embolus should be considered, especially in patients who are rapidly deteriorating with worsening hypoxemia, increasing A-a gradient, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> signs of cardiogenic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-acute-chest-syndrome-in-children-and-adolescents-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. If PE is detected, treatment with anticoagulation is appropriate. The diagnosis and management of PE are discussed separately.

Evidence from an observational study suggests that over half of children &lt;4 years of age who are admitted with an episode of ACS will be rehospitalized within a year for ACS or an acute pain episode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-acute-chest-syndrome-in-children-and-adolescents-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].

It is the most common cause of death, with one-fourth of SCD-related deaths due to ACS. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ACS develops when a trigger causes deoxygenation of hemoglobin S (Hgb S), leading to polymerization of Hgb S and sickling of red blood cells (RBCs) within the pulmonary vasculature, which results in vaso-occlusion, ischemia, and endothelial injury. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The specific cause of ACS is often not identifiable or may be multifactorial. In children, infection and vaso-occlusive crisis are the most common identifiable causes. Infectious agents include viruses, mycoplasma, chlamydia, and bacterial organisms. Remarkably, <strong>half</strong> of the cases of ACS occur in patients who have already been hospitalized for other reasons, most frequently for vaso-occlusive crisis. Hypoventilation from rib and vertebral bone pain, or from opioid analgesics, may lead to atelectasis, local <span class=\"nowrap\">ventilation/perfusion</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(V/Q)</span> mismatch, and intrapulmonary sickling. Patients with SCD and asthma appear to be at increased risk for ACS. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of acute chest syndrome requires a new pulmonary infiltrate on chest radiography that involves at least one complete lung segment, <strong>and</strong> one or more of the following: chest pain; temperature &gt;38.5&ordm;C; hypoxemia; and signs of tachypnea, wheezing, cough, or the appearance of increased work of breathing. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with SCD who have fever, chest pain, or respiratory symptoms should have chest radiographs because ACS may be present even though it is not clinically suspected (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute management involves treating the underlying factors that contribute to sickling of the RBCs and reversing the sickling process. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Acute management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Adequate analgesia of spine, thoracic, and abdominal pain is important to prevent hypoventilation and atelectasis. For children and adolescents with acute SCD pain, we suggest the initial use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketorolac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ketorolac</a> as a nonsedating analgesic (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This differs from adults, in whom we avoid ketorolac. For those requiring <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> or other opioids, use of patient controlled analgesia (PCA) may minimize oversedation and hypoventilation but still provide adequate pain control. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Pain control'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Respiratory support is provided to maintain oxygen saturation &ge;92 percent and includes supplemental oxygen, frequent incentive spirometry, and continuous positive pressure ventilation devices. For patients with poor respiratory effort or rising oxygen requirements, the use of non-invasive ventilation, such as nasal mask continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) may be useful. We recommend the use of bronchodilators in patients with wheezing or a prior history of asthma (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). A short-term course of corticosteroids may also be appropriate for the child with SCD and symptomatic asthma, but these should be tapered to reduce the risk of rebound vaso-occlusive crisis. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Respiratory support'</a> above and <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Corticosteroids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Because infection is one of the most common causes of ACS, we recommend broad spectrum antibiotic coverage for patients presenting with ACS (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). We typically use a third generation cephalosporin (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotaxime</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a>) for bacterial coverage, and a macrolide (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a>) for coverage of atypical organisms. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients with acute chest syndrome (ACS), transfusion therapy improves oxygenation and should be considered early in the management of these patients. Transfusion therapy is generally used to prevent respiratory failure in severe cases of ACS and in patients who continue to show progression of ACS or continued dropping hematocrit (Hct) despite other therapeutic interventions. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Transfusion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term management is directed towards preventing recurrence of ACS and its complications. It includes decreasing risk of infection (prophylactic antibiotics and immunization), management of asthma, and decreasing the risk of RBC sickling (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> and transfusion therapy; possibly hematopoietic cell transplantation).
