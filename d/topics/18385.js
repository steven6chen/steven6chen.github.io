Epinephrine (also known as adrenaline) is a medicine that treats the symptoms of serious allergic reactions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Anaphylaxis symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT AND FAMILY EDUCATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A person with allergies, as well as his or her family, close friends, teachers, and coworkers, should learn to use an epinephrine autoinjector before it is needed. Anaphylaxis is unpredictable, and while a person may have a mild reaction one time, a serious or even life-threatening reaction can occur the next time. A person suffering with anaphylaxis may panic and be unable to assist with <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> own injection. In addition, a quick response is necessary to prevent serious complications of anaphylaxis.</p><p>An epinephrine autoinjector prescription should be filled immediately. People who are at risk of anaphylaxis should keep at least one epinephrine autoinjector with them at all times. Most allergy specialists recommend having at least two doses of epinephrine available, and some prescribe more. The reason for this is that more than one dose of epinephrine may be needed to treat a more severe anaphylactic reaction.</p><p>After filling the prescription, <span class=\"nowrap\">patients/caregivers</span> should practice using the autoinjector. Many manufacturers include a practice autoinjector (that does not have a needle or actual medicine). A video (on the internet or DVD) showing how the autoinjector is used is available from some manufacturers and should be reviewed periodically.</p><p>The autoinjector should always be available, including at school or work, when attending parties or traveling, during exercise, and while dining out. It should be kept in a place that can be easily located by others in an emergency, and family and friends should be informed about where the autoinjector is stored. It is also important to ensure that the autoinjector is not expired, although an expired autoinjector may be used if there is no alternative.</p><p>Epinephrine should be stored at normal room temperature, away from extreme cold and heat. Epinephrine autoinjectors are unlikely to be damaged by radiograph equipment at airport security.</p><p>The epinephrine cartridge window should be examined periodically to ensure that the solution is colorless and contains no floating particles. Solutions that are discolored or contain particles should be replaced. Autoinjectors that have expired should be replaced even if the solution still looks clear. Although far from ideal, if the only epinephrine available in an emergency is in an outdated autoinjector and the solution still looks clear and free of particles, that device can be used, as it is better than not treating. Expired autoinjectors may still have some amount of active epinephrine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SYMPTOMS OF ALLERGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Allergic reactions can produce symptoms throughout the body. The symptoms of anaphylaxis are discussed in detail in a separate topic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Anaphylaxis symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EPINEPHRINE IS THE BEST TREATMENT FOR ANAPHYLAXIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epinephrine is the best treatment for anaphylaxis, and it works best if it is given within the first few minutes of a severe allergic reaction. Epinephrine rapidly treats all of the most dangerous symptoms of anaphylaxis, including throat swelling, difficulty breathing, and low blood pressure. However, epinephrine is not a perfect treatment, so allergic triggers should be avoided.</p><p>Other medicines that are used in the treatment of allergic reactions can help with some of the symptoms, but only epinephrine treats the entire reaction. Antihistamines (such as diphenhydramine and others) help with itching and hives, and asthma inhalers (such as albuterol) can help with coughing and wheezing, but these medications do not treat the dangerous symptoms of throat swelling and low blood pressure. In addition, antihistamines taken by mouth are too slow-acting to be effective in a rapidly developing episode of anaphylaxis. In contrast, injected epinephrine works within a few minutes.</p><p>In short, antihistamines and asthma inhalers are useful in the treatment of anaphylaxis, but they are <strong>not</strong> substitutes for epinephrine. There is no substitute for epinephrine in anaphylaxis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">WHEN TO USE AN EPINEPHRINE AUTOINJECTOR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A person who is having an allergic reaction should use <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> epinephrine autoinjector <strong>immediately</strong> if <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is</span> having trouble breathing.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feels tightness in the throat.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feels lightheaded or thinks that <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> might pass out.</p><p/><p>If treating a child with an allergic reaction, <strong>also</strong> use the autoinjector if the child:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is not responding, seems groggy, or passes out during an allergic reaction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has food allergies and is vomiting repeatedly shortly after eating, especially if these symptoms are accompanied by flushing or hives.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is coughing repeatedly during an allergic reaction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Had previous anaphylaxis and develops widespread hives after possibly eating a trigger food.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has definitely eaten a trigger food that previously caused very severe anaphylaxis. In this case, use the autoinjector before symptoms appear.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">HOW TO USE AN EPINEPHRINE AUTOINJECTOR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient and a family member should review instructions provided with the autoinjector each time a refill is obtained in case there are changes. Instructions may differ from one autoinjector to another. <span class=\"nowrap\">Patients/families</span> should watch videos or review pictures of administration of the autoinjector(s) they are prescribed. Although the EpiPen manufacturer suggests &quot;swinging&quot; the device, another option is simply to press the unit firmly against the leg to activate it. Swinging can result in missing the intended location or twisting the device.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">EpiPen or EpiPen Jr</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These epinephrine autoinjectors contain one dose per autoinjector. They are available in two different doses, one intended for older children and adults and the other for use in young children.</p><p>Stay with other people, if possible. There is no need to undress, because the injector works through clothing. However, when possible, lift the edge of a skirt or lower pants to avoid hitting a buckle, zipper, or contents of the pockets.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(1) Flip open the cap and remove the pen from its carrier tube.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(2) Hold the autoinjector in your dominant hand, making a fist. Keep fingers away from both ends to avoid sticking them. The end with the orange tip contains the needle and should be facing down. Use your other hand to pull off the blue safety release. If you are giving the injection to a child or someone who might not be able to stay still, hold <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> leg firmly in place so <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> does not move.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(3) Hold the orange tip near the outer thigh. Swing and <strong>firmly push</strong> against the outer thigh until it clicks so that the unit is perpendicular (90 degree angle) to the thigh. <strong>Hold in place for at least two to three seconds</strong> to allow all of the medicine to be injected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F75436\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75436 \">picture 1</a>). The cartridge window will become obscured.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(4) Remove the pen from the thigh. The orange needle cover will extend to automatically cover the needle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(5) Massage the injected area for 10 seconds.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(6) Call 911 and get to the nearest emergency department immediately (patients should <strong>not</strong> drive themselves). Allergic reactions sometimes come back.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(7) Take the used autoinjector with you to the hospital emergency department so that it can be disposed of safely.</p><p/><p>The EpiPen is available in packages of two, in case a second dose is needed. Large-sized adults may need to repeat the dose. A second dose may also be needed if symptoms are not improving or getting worse after about five minutes or if symptoms come back before reaching the emergency department.</p><p>There are also generic versions of EpiPen available. These work the same as the brand-name version.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4286983469\"><span class=\"h2\">Auvi-Q</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Auvi-Q (or the Canadian version, Allerject) epinephrine autoinjectors contain one dose per autoinjector. They are rectangular, about the size of a cellular phone, and play a recording that explains each step in the self-injecting process. They are available in two different doses, one intended for older children and adults and the other for use in young children.</p><p>Stay with other people, if possible. There is no need to undress, because the autoinjector works through clothing. However, when possible, lift the edge of a skirt or lower pants to avoid hitting a buckle, zipper, or contents of the pockets.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(1) Pull downwards to remove the blue or red case.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(2) Pull off the red safety guard. This will reveal a black end which contains a needle inside. Do not place your finger or hand over the black end.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(3) Place the black end against the upper, outer thigh, and press down hard until the autoinjector fires (you will hear a click and a hiss). <strong>Hold in place for at least two to three seconds.</strong> The instructions that come with the device may suggest holding it in place for longer, but the full dose of epinephrine is delivered within the first few seconds.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(4) Remove the autoinjector.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(5) Call 911 and get to the nearest emergency department immediately. (Patients should <strong>not</strong> drive themselves). Allergic reactions sometimes come back.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(6) Take the used autoinjector to the hospital for disposal.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9852352\"><span class=\"h2\">Adrenaclick</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This autoinjector contains one dose of epinephrine. It is available in two different strengths, one intended for use in children and the other for use in adolescents and adults. Adrenaclick is not available in the United States, although it may be again in the future.</p><p>Stay with other people, if possible. There is no need to undress, because the injector works through clothing. However, when possible, lift the edge of a skirt or lower pants to avoid hitting a buckle, zipper, or contents of the pockets.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(1) Remove the autoinjector from its gray case.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(2) Pull off the gray cap, labeled &quot;1.&quot; This will reveal a red tip, which contains a needle inside. Do not place your finger or hand over the red tip.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(3) Pull off the gray cap, labeled &quot;2.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(4) Form a fist around the autoinjector with the red tip pointing down.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(5) Place the red tip against the upper, outer thigh, and press down hard until the autoinjector fires (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F75436\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75436 \">picture 1</a>). <strong>Hold in place for at least two to three seconds.</strong> The instructions that come with the device may suggest holding it in place for longer, but the full dose of epinephrine is delivered within the first few seconds.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(6) Remove the autoinjector and check the red cap. If the needle is visible, epinephrine was given. If the needle is not present, repeat steps 4 through 5 again.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(7) Massage the injected area for 10 seconds.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(8) Call 911 and get to the nearest emergency department immediately. Patients should <strong>not</strong> drive themselves. Allergic reactions sometimes come back.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(9) Place the used autoinjector back into the carrying case needle end first, and close the case by putting the light gray case top over the non-needle end and close the case. Take the case to the hospital for disposal.</p><p/><p>There are also generic versions of Adrenaclick available. These work the same as the brand-name version.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9852359\"><span class=\"h2\">Other devices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other devices may be available around the world.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Immediately after using the autoinjector</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After using an autoinjector, it is important to immediately seek care in an emergency department. The reaction may initially improve but then come back. When possible, ask someone else to call for help. If alone, treat with the autoinjector first, and then call or walk for help. The reason for seeking medical attention is because of the allergic reaction, <strong>not</strong> because epinephrine was used. Epinephrine is safe, but symptoms of the allergic reaction could return, which is why medical attention is needed.</p><p>If the person experiencing anaphylaxis begins to feel weak or dizzy, have <span class=\"nowrap\">him/her</span> lie down and elevate the knees or feet. If <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> feels faint or has fainted, leave <span class=\"nowrap\">him/her</span> in the lying down position. <strong>Never</strong> prop <span class=\"nowrap\">him/her</span> up, because this can prevent blood from reaching the heart and brain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Side effects of epinephrine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The benefits of epinephrine are <strong>far greater</strong> than the risk of side effects. However, epinephrine can cause short-lived side effects in some patients. The most common side effects include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart &ndash; Fast <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pounding heartbeat, fleeting chest pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nervous system &ndash; Nervousness, trembling, feeling cold, anxiety, headache, dizziness</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Digestive system &ndash; Nausea, dry throat</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lungs &ndash; Fleeting shortness of breath</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Autoinjector disposal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The autoinjector should not be thrown away in the normal trash. Instead, patients should take their used or expired autoinjector (inside the case) to a hospital or health care provider for proper disposal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People have varying responses to a severe allergic reaction. Some people have symptoms that will resolve rapidly and completely with treatment. These people may feel tired but otherwise normal afterwards. Other people have symptoms that take longer to resolve. For most people, facial swelling and asthma symptoms resolve completely after 24 to 48 hours.</p><p>Some people experience a second reaction after the initial allergic reaction, although this is not common. Second reactions can occur hours to one day later, although most second reactions happen within eight hours. For this reason, it is important to stay at the emergency department for several hours of observation after a reaction.</p><p>A health care provider may prescribe additional medications for treatment after a reaction, such as antihistamines or oral glucocorticoids (eg, prednisone). It is possible (but not proven) that these medications can help to prevent a second reaction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2186320889\"><span class=\"h1\">COST CONCERNS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your autoinjectors are very expensive, ask your doctor or nurse whether there might be other options. You may be able to save money by switching from a brand name (such as EpiPen) to a generic version. Generic autoinjectors contain the same medicine and work in the same way as the brand-name versions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your health care provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our website (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=365\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
