Complications include the development of gangrene and gallbladder perforation, which can be life-threatening. </p><p>The treatment of acute calculous cholecystitis will be reviewed here. The approach to patients with asymptomatic gallstones, the approach to the pregnant patient with gallstones, and the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of biliary colic, acute cholecystitis and related conditions, such as acalculous and xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis, are discussed separately.

Without treatment to eliminate the gallstones, the likelihood of subsequent symptoms or complications is high. Complications include the development of gangrene and gallbladder perforation, which can be life-threatening. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Morbidity and mortality'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the National Cooperative Gallstone Study, a trial of nonsurgical treatment with chenodiol for biliary tract pain, demonstrated that the risk of recurrent symptoms for untreated patients was approximately 70 percent during the two years following initial presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a cohort study of 25,397 patients from Ontario, Canada with a first episode of uncomplicated acute cholecystitis, 10,304 did not undergo cholecystectomy on their first admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. During a median 3.4 years of follow-up, 24 percent of patients had a gallstone-related event with the majority of events occurring within the first year (88 percent). The risk was highest among 18 to 34-year-old patients. Among the events, 30 percent were for biliary obstruction or pancreatitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A review of the United States Medicare database that included 29,818 elderly patients with acute cholecystitis, found a higher risk for mortality over the following two years in patients who were discharged without surgery compared with patients who underwent cholecystectomy in the initial hospitalization (hazard ratio [HR] 1.56, 95% CI 1.47-1.65) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p/><p>Our treatment approach is as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F64526\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef64526 \">algorithm 1</a>): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with acute cholecystitis should be admitted to the hospital for supportive care, which includes intravenous fluid therapy, correction of electrolyte disorders, and control of pain. Antibiotics may also be indicated. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Supportive care'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The selection and timing of definitive therapy depends upon the severity of symptoms and the patient's overall risk for cholecystectomy.

For patients whose medical status can be optimized to allow surgery, cholecystectomy can be considered.

Patients have often been ill for days prior to seeking medical attention, making intravenous hydration and correction of any associated electrolyte disorders an important initial measure in the first 24 to 48 hours after admission. </p><p>Patients should be kept fasting, and although uncommonly needed, those who are vomiting should have placement of a nasogastric tube. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nasogastric-and-nasoenteric-tubes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nasogastric and nasoenteric tubes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11016944\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain control in patients with acute cholecystitis can usually be achieved with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or opioids. Progression of pain during treatment for acute cholecystitis, despite adequate analgesia, is an indicator of a clinical progression. </p><p>We prefer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketorolac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketorolac</a> (30 to 60 mg adjusted for age and renal function given in a single intramuscular dose) for patients with biliary colic. Treatment usually relieves symptoms within 20 to 30 minutes. Opioids, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydromorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydromorphone</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meperidine-pethidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meperidine</a> are appropriate therapy for patients who have contraindications to NSAIDs or who do not achieve adequate pain relief with an NSAID, which may be more common in patients with acute cholecystitis compared with uncomplicated gallstone disease.</p><p>It was traditionally thought that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meperidine-pethidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meperidine</a> was the opioid of choice in patients with gallstone disease because it has less of an effect on sphincter of Oddi motility than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. However, a systematic review found that all opioids increase sphincter of Oddi pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. There are insufficient data to suggest that morphine should be avoided. Morphine has an advantage that it requires less frequent dosing than meperidine, which has a shorter half-life.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute cholecystitis is primarily an inflammatory process, but secondary infection of the gallbladder can occur as a result of cystic duct obstruction and bile stasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. The rate of empyema and pericholecystic abscess is overall low, but patients can easily develop life-threatening gram negative sepsis from uncomplicated, acute cholecystitis. Thus, antibiotics are commonly administered at the outset to protect against sepsis and wound infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Studies are conflicting as to whether antibiotics are required for the treatment of uncomplicated, acute cholecystitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis/abstract/7,8,10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,10-12</a>]. One study of 302 patients showed a lower rate of bacteremia and wound infection, but no difference in the development of empyema of the gallbladder or pericholecystic abscesses with the administration of antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This is likely due to the obstruction to bile flow that interferes with achieving adequate gallbladder bile concentrations of antibiotics. </p><p>Many clinicians routinely administer antimicrobial therapy to all patients diagnosed with acute cholecystitis, which are continued until the gallbladder is removed or the cholecystitis clinically resolves. Others advocate that antimicrobial therapy should only be instituted if infection is suspected on the basis of laboratory (more than 12,500 white cells per cubic millimeter) or clinical findings (temperature of more than 38.5&deg;C), or in patients with a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis and radiographic findings indicative of gallbladder rupture, ischemia or necrosis (eg, air in the gallbladder or gallbladder wall). Routine antibiotics are also recommended in older patients or those with diabetes or immunodeficiency with a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis regardless of these signs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis/abstract/10,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14</a>].

In a study of 467 patients, including a control group of 42 with normal biliary trees, positive bile cultures were found in 22 percent of patients with symptomatic gallstones and 46 percent of patients with acute cholecystitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The most frequent isolates from the gallbladder or common bile duct were Escherichia coli (41 percent), Enterococcus (12 percent), Klebsiella (11 percent), and Enterobacter (9 percent). Whenever possible, the chosen agent(s) should also achieve adequate concentrations in bile. </p><p>The guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend the following antibiotic regimens for patients with acute cholecystitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F108360\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108360 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with community-acquired acute cholecystitis of mild-to-moderate severity: <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefazolin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefazolin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefuroxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefuroxime</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with community-acquired acute cholecystitis of severe physiologic disturbance, advanced age, or immunocompromised state: imipenem-cilastatin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meropenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meropenem</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doripenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doripenem</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piperacillin-and-tazobactam-sodium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piperacillin-tazobactam</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levofloxacin</a> plus metronidazole, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefepime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefepime</a> plus metronidazole.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with healthcare-associated biliary infection of any severity: imipenem-cilastatin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meropenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meropenem</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doripenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doripenem</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piperacillin-and-tazobactam-sodium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piperacillin-tazobactam</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levofloxacin</a> plus metronidazole, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefepime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefepime</a> plus metronidazole, with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> added to each regimen. </p><p/><p>The choosing of an antibiotic regimen within each patient category is governed by local practices, taking into consideration the antibiogram and formulary of each institution.

A multicenter trial randomly assigned 414 patients hospitalized for mild or moderate calculous cholecystitis to continue their preoperative antibiotic regimen for five days (2 g <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a> plus clavulanic acid, three times daily) or to receive no antibiotics following cholecystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. No significant differences in postoperative infection rates (17 versus 15 percent) were found. These results support our current practice of discontinuing antibiotics the day after the cholecystectomy for patients with uncomplicated cholecystitis. Clinical judgement should dictate antibiotic management in more complicated scenarios, such as in the septic postoperative patient.</p><p>The need for prophylactic antibiotics at the time of surgery in the absence of clinical <span class=\"nowrap\">symptoms/signs</span> of biliary infection is discussed elsewhere.

Evidence from large database reviews and randomized trials show that cholecystectomy performed early during the initial hospitalization may be associated with reduced perioperative morbidity and mortality in some patients, and reduces the length of hospital stay and cost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis/abstract/3,18-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,18-30</a>]. </p><p>The best data come from a meta-analysis of 15 trials including 1625 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Compared with delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy, early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (performed within seven days of symptom onset) was associated with less wound infection (relative risk 0.65, 95% CI 0.47-0.91), a shorter hospital stay (mean difference [MD] -3 days, 95% CI -4 to -2), fewer work days lost (MD -11 days, 95% CI -16 to -6), but a longer operative time (MD 11 minutes, 95% CI 5-18). Early surgery did not increase the rate of mortality, bile duct injury, bile leakage, conversion to open surgery, or overall complications.</p><p>A large administrative database study of over 15,000 cholecystectomies for acute cholecystitis provided even more granular data on how timing of cholecystectomy can impact patient outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In that study, the rate of intraoperatively detected biliary injury was the lowest in patients who underwent surgery on the day of admission; the rate increased day by day thereafter. The rate of other intraoperative adverse events (eg, bleeding), as well as 30- and 90-day mortality rates, were lower in patients who underwent surgery on the first or second day after admission than either on the day of admission or after the second day after admission. The authors of the study advocated operating within two days of admission, but after patients have been adequately resuscitated, and when the most qualified surgeon becomes available. Although there were no data, they speculated that the slightly higher rate of nonbiliary adverse events that occurred when patients underwent surgery on the day of admission compared with the day after were due to under-resuscitation of the patient or a lack of laparoscopic surgical expertise.</p><p>Early surgery is also easier to perform, as local inflammation increases 72 hours after the initial onset of symptoms, making dissection less precise, increasing the severity of surgical complications, and making open conversion more likely. </p><p>Nevertheless, there are data to suggest that surgery is still safe even after 72 hours of symptom onset, albeit with a higher rate of conversion from laparoscopic to open technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis/abstract/27,33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,33-35</a>]. In a randomized trial of 86 patients with acute cholecystitis who had more than 72 hours of symptoms, early laparoscopic cholecystectomy during the index admission was safe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Of 42 patients who received early surgery, only one required conversion to open surgery; none had a bile leak or bile duct injury. Compared with surgery delayed for six weeks, early surgery reduced the overall morbidity rate from 39 to 14 percent. Given that the postoperative complication rates (15 percent early versus 17 percent delayed) were similar, the difference in morbidity was almost entirely accounted for by morbidities that occurred during the waiting period in patients who were waiting for delayed surgery (3 failed initial treatment; 10 required unplanned readmission while awaiting surgery). The length of stay (four versus seven days), duration of antibiotic therapy (2 versus 10 days), and total hospital cost (&euro;9349 versus &euro;12,361) were also in favor of early surgery. The authors of this trial argued that the degree of inflammatory changes associated with acute cholecystitis may not be time dependent as previously thought [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>] and therefore suggested early laparoscopic cholecystectomy may be offered to patients with acute cholecystitis regardless of the duration of symptoms. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1054590\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is considered the standard approach for the surgical treatment of acute calculous cholecystitis. Compared with open cholecystectomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy reduces postoperative pain and significantly shortens hospital length of stay and convalescence, and time away from work, and is preferred by many patients from a cosmetic viewpoint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis/abstract/38-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-44</a>]. However, the overall serious complication rate in laparoscopic cholecystectomy remains higher than that seen with open cholecystectomy; thus, the threshold for conversion to an open procedure should be low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. Factors which may lead the surgeon to primarily choose, or convert to, an open approach are discussed in detail elsewhere.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laparoscopic-cholecystectomy#H114901272\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laparoscopic cholecystectomy&quot;, section on 'Abdominal access'</a>.)</p><p>For selected patients in whom the risk for injury or excessive blood loss is deemed too high to perform cholecystectomy, a cholecystostomy or a subtotal cholecystectomy can be performed. The latter procedure achieves control of the cystic duct at the level of the neck of the gallbladder and leaves the dome of the gallbladder adherent to the liver fossa in situ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. Biliary leaks can still occur, but these can generally be managed conservatively.

For those who fail to improve, gallbladder drainage should be implemented with the eventual goal of performing cholecystectomy. Once cholecystitis resolves, the patient&rsquo;s risk for surgery should be reassessed. Patients who have become reasonable candidates for surgery should undergo elective cholecystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Medical management with interval cholecystectomy only for recurrent acute cholecystitis may be appropriate in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. </p><p>However, an initial surgical approach may be preferred in some high-risk patients (eg, gangrenous or emphysematous cholecystitis) for whom the burden of the ongoing systemic effects of cholecystitis is deemed to be greater than the risk of surgery. In a study of 483 patients undergoing cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis, gangrenous cholecystitis was found in 24 (5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Patients with gangrenous gallbladders had a much higher mortality rate than patients who had inflamed but nongangrenous gallbladders (12.5 versus 0.9 percent). In the same study, gallbladder gangrene was associated with an older age, male sex, and a higher preoperative bilirubin level, as well as comorbid medical conditions such as diabetes, coronary artery disease, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1937215\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For high-risk patients, the initial approach should include antibiotic therapy and bowel rest, followed by either cholecystectomy for those who improve or gallbladder drainage for those who fail to improve. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotics'</a> above.)</p><p>Percutaneous cholecystostomy is indicated in patients who fail an initial trial of antibiotic therapy. In a trial of 123 high-risk patients with acute cholecystitis who were randomly assigned to percutaneous cholecystostomy or antibiotic therapy, a similar percentage of patients in each group had resolution of their symptoms (86 versus 87 percent). All successfully treated patients showed clinical improvement within the first three days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>], supporting the use of antibiotics as initial therapy of cholecystitis in high-risk patients. However, gallbladder drainage by percutaneous cholecystostomy in conjunction with antibiotics may be the best initial treatment for very ill patients (ie, intensive care unit) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis/abstract/54-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-57</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5146500\"><span class=\"h2\">Gallbladder drainage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some form of gallbladder drainage is required for high-risk patients managed conservatively but who show no appreciable improvement and progress to severe symptoms. The goal of drainage is to direct purulent material away from the obstructed gallbladder, which also allows for resolution of edema, which often &ldquo;opens&rdquo; up the obstructed cystic duct. </p><p>Gallbladder drainage can be accomplished via percutaneous, endoscopic, or surgical approaches. In one retrospective review of 185 patients, 78 percent were treated with percutaneous cholecystostomy, and 22 percent with a tube placed surgically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Over half the patients (57 percent) subsequently underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Decompressing the gallbladder allows both local inflammation and systemic illness to resolve, before gallbladder removal could be accomplished with less risk to the patient. The timing of cholecystectomy after gallbladder drainage can be variable, ranging from immediately after clinical improvement to after eight weeks. We typically perform cholecystectomy prior to three days from the onset of symptoms or after six weeks otherwise. However, some patients benefit from cholecystectomy within these boundaries when their clinical situation dictates necessity to proceed in order to accelerate delivery of care. </p><p>In a randomized trial comparing percutaneous cholecystostomy followed by early (within six days) laparoscopic cholecystectomy versus antibiotic therapy followed by delayed (after eight weeks) laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 70 high-risk patients with acute cholecystitis, patients who received percutaneous cholecystostomy recovered sooner with a shorter mean hospital stay (5 versus 15 days) and lower cost ($2612 versus $3735) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. All patients in the percutaneous cholecystostomy group experienced symptomatic relief within 24 hours after catheter placement, whereas patients in the antibiotic group improved within 48 to 72 hours. In addition, at subsequent cholecystectomy, there was a lower conversion rate from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy in the percutaneous cholecystostomy group (6 versus 13 percent).</p><p>In a prospective study of 91 high-risk patients with acute cholecystitis, patients were nonrandomly assigned to either emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy or percutaneous cholecystostomy followed by delayed cholecystectomy after four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Patients in the cholecystostomy group had a lower frequency of conversion to open surgery (8 versus 19 percent), a lower risk of intraoperative bleeding &gt;100 mL (9 versus 33 percent), a shorter mean hospital stay (3 versus 5.3 days), and a lower risk of complications (9 versus 35 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Similar findings were reached by retrospective studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis/abstract/61-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-63</a>].</p><p>In retrospective studies, higher mortality and morbidity rates have often been associated with percutaneous cholecystostomy treatment of acute cholecystitis compared with cholecystectomy. As an example, in one retrospective review that included 1918 patients, 30-day mortality after percutaneous cholecystostomy was 15.4 percent, but only 4.5 percent for cholecystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. This difference is likely due to patient selection bias, as the healthiest cohort is selected by surgeons for surgical management. Patients who underwent percutaneous cholecystostomy were usually older, and had a higher ASA classification, more comorbidities, longer hospital stay, more complications, and more readmissions. In one time-cohort study, the 30-day mortality rate decreased from 36 to 12 percent when more &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; patients (ASA class I and II: 0 versus 18 percent) underwent the percutaneous cholecystostomy procedure between 1998 and 2009, compared with the time period from 1989 to 1998 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. A randomized prospective trial comparing percutaneous cholecystostomy with cholecystectomy treatment of acute cholecystitis in high surgical risk patients is underway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>The technical success of percutaneous cholecystostomy ranges from 82 to 100 percent in various series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis/abstract/54-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-57</a>]. In a retrospective review, the outcomes of 106 patients with acute cholecystitis (calculous and acalculous) treated by percutaneous cholecystostomy were evaluated over a 10-year period; 67 percent presented to the emergency room and 23 percent were inpatients admitted initially for other conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. About half in each group had gallstones. After cholecystostomy tube placement, clinical improvement was seen overall in 68 percent, whereas 32 percent showed no improvement or clinically worsened. More patients who presented to the emergency department primarily with acute cholecystitis showed improvement compared with the inpatients (84 versus 34 percent).</p><p>Minor complications of percutaneous drainage include bleeding, catheter blockage and dislodgement (10 to 15 percent), and failure to resolve the acute cholecystitis (10 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis/abstract/55,57,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,57,68</a>].

Failure is usually related to ineffective drainage due to thick sludge or pus. We generally irrigate the gallbladder contents manually with normal saline through the catheter. If irrigation is ineffective, the percutaneous pigtail catheter can be replaced over a wire with a larger one to achieve more effective irrigation.</p><p>Percutaneous cholecystostomy is often performed with the intent of delayed cholecystectomy; however, many patients do not actually go on to receive cholecystectomy due to ongoing contraindications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis/abstract/58,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,69</a>].

However, this technique can be technically challenging because the cystic duct is often narrow and tortuous. In addition, this procedure has all the inherent and occasionally serious complications associated with endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (eg, postsphincterotomy bleeding) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-indications-patient-preparation-and-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography: Indications, patient preparation, and complications&quot;</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14805492\"><span class=\"h4\">Transmural drainage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transmural drainage utilizes endoscopic ultrasound guidance to access the inflamed gallbladder with a needle puncture, followed by dilation and stent placement over a guidewire.

The transmural drainage technique is technically successful in most cases (97 percent) and resolves acute cholecystitis in over 95 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. </p><p>In a randomized trial involving 59 patients with acute cholecystitis, who did not respond to initial medical management and were not surgical candidates, transmural drainage was as effective as percutaneous drainage of the gallbladder in terms of technical (97 versus 97 percent) and clinical success rates (100 versus 96 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Similar proportions of patients in each group developed complications (7 versus 3 percent) and required conversion to open surgery when they eventually underwent laparoscopic gallbladder surgery (9 versus 12 percent).

Once a patient develops acute cholecystitis, definitive therapy aimed at eliminating the gallstones is recommended. Without definitive therapy, the likelihood of recurrent symptoms or complications is high. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1053804\" class=\"local\">'Overview of treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients diagnosed with acute cholecystitis should be admitted to the hospital. Initial supportive care includes intravenous fluid therapy, correction of electrolyte disorders, and control of pain. Adequate pain control can usually be achieved with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or opioids. Patients should be kept fasting and those who are vomiting may need placement of a nasogastric tube. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Supportive care'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute cholecystitis is primarily an inflammatory process, but secondary infection of the gallbladder can occur as a result of cystic duct obstruction and bile stasis. Many clinicians routinely administer antimicrobial therapy to all patients diagnosed with acute cholecystitis, which are continued until the gallbladder is removed or the cholecystitis clinically resolves. If sepsis is suspected (laboratory or clinical findings), or radiographic findings are indicative of gallbladder ischemia or necrosis, we suggest empiric antibiotic therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Antibiotic options and doses are provided in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F67894\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67894 \">table 3</a>). For patients with uncomplicated cholecystitis, we discontinue antibiotics the day after the cholecystectomy. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The choice and timing of intervention for acute cholecystitis (cholecystectomy, gallbladder drainage) depends upon the severity of symptoms and the patient's overall risk of surgery. Drainage options include percutaneous or open cholecystostomy and endoscopic transpapillary or transmural drainage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Emergent intervention is indicated for patients with: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Progressive symptoms and signs such as high fever, hemodynamic instability, or intractable pain in spite of adequate pain medication.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Suspicion of gallbladder gangrene or gallbladder perforation </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients without emergent indications for definitive therapy who are low risk for surgery, we recommend cholecystectomy during the initial hospitalization (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Cholecystectomy performed early rather than later in the hospitalization may be associated with reduced perioperative morbidity and mortality. Low-risk patients generally undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Compared with open cholecystectomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy reduces postoperative pain and significantly shortens the length of hospital stay and convalescence. (See <a href=\"#H1054419\" class=\"local\">'Timing of cholecystectomy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Low-risk patients'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients without emergent indications for definitive therapy, and in whom the risk of cholecystectomy outweighs the potential benefits, gallbladder drainage with percutaneous cholecystostomy or one of the endoscopic drainage procedures is indicated if symptoms do not improve with supportive care. Once cholecystitis resolves, the patient&rsquo;s risk for surgery should be reassessed. Patients who have become reasonable candidates for surgery should undergo elective cholecystectomy. Patients who stabilize with gallbladder drainage but continue to be at high-risk for surgery can be considered for percutaneous gallstone extraction with or without mechanical lithotripsy.
