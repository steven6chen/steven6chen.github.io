The subtypes of bipolar disorder include bipolar I and bipolar II. Patients with bipolar I disorder experience manic episodes, and nearly always experience major depressive and hypomanic episodes. Bipolar II disorder is marked by at least one hypomanic episode, at least one major depressive episode, and the absence of manic episodes.

Many female bipolar patients of childbearing age are treated with medications, but do not use contraception and are not trying to conceive. In a survey of 136 female patients receiving maintenance pharmacotherapy (including drugs that appear to be teratogenic), 41 percent did not use birth control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-women-contraception-and-preconception-assessment-and-counseling/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>Female bipolar patients should be encouraged to use long-acting reversible contraceptives, such as intrauterine devices or implants; these require much less attention from the user and are among the most effective methods. In particular, the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=copper-intrauterine-device-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">copper intrauterine device</a> will not interfere with concurrent medications, is nonhormonal, and can be effective for at least 12 years.

Thus, we suggest that bipolar patients who are treated with carbamazepine avoid combined hormonal contraception (oral, patch, and vaginal ring) and use the injectable contraceptive, implant, or intrauterine device as first line contraception.

Antiepileptics that are used to treat bipolar disorder may interact with hormonal contraception. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Carbamazepine</a> may render oral contraceptives ineffective, and conversely, oral contraceptives that include estrogen may reduce the effectiveness of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamotrigine</a>. (See <a href=\"#H1866827\" class=\"local\">'Contraception'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical assessment of bipolar patients who consider becoming pregnant includes a psychiatric and general medical history, mental status and physical examination, and focused laboratory tests. The psychiatric history should emphasize age, body mass index (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-body-mass-index-bmi-quetelets-index-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>), current clinical status of bipolar disorder and course of illness, medications, supplements, substance abuse, and psychosocial functioning. (See <a href=\"#H1866121\" class=\"local\">'Preconception assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bipolar patients may have more difficulty conceiving than individuals without the disorder, but this is not established. Antipsychotics and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a> can cause ovulatory dysfunction. (See <a href=\"#H37198185\" class=\"local\">'Fertility'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Euthymic bipolar patients often receive maintenance pharmacotherapy prior to conception and during pregnancy.

The risk of recurrence appears to be greatest during the first trimester, and the most common morbidity is major depression. Risk factors for recurrence include a shorter period of clinical stability prior to conception, discontinuing pharmacotherapy (especially if medications are tapered and stopped in less than 15 days), unplanned pregnancy, current psychiatric comorbidity, lifetime duration of bipolar disorder &ge;5 years, and history of at least one recurrent mood episode per year following onset of bipolar disorder. (See <a href=\"#H317070\" class=\"local\">'Relapse during pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes appear to be more common in women with bipolar disorder regardless of treatment status, compared to women without bipolar disorder. (See <a href=\"#H13363306\" class=\"local\">'Risk of pregnancy complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The base rate for congenital defects in the offspring of patients with bipolar disorder appears to be no different than that of the general population, which is two to five percent. However, some medications used to treat bipolar disorder appear to be teratogenic, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>, and to a lesser extent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a>.

The estimated prevalence of bipolar disorder in children of families with one bipolar parent is 9 percent, whereas the rate in the general population is 1 to 2 percent. (See <a href=\"#H13362983\" class=\"local\">'Bipolar disorder'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition, the offspring of bipolar parents may inherit schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, unipolar major depressive disorder, substance use disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and anxiety disorders. (See <a href=\"#H6188971\" class=\"local\">'Other disorders'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy outcomes may be improved in bipolar patients who achieve clinical stability prior to conception and use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a>.
