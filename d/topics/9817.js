Leukocyte emigration to sites of inflammation is a dynamic process, involving multiple steps in an adhesion cascade. Various adhesion molecules are expressed on both resting and stimulated endothelial cells and leukocytes.</p><p>Defects in a number of these adhesion molecules result in recognized clinical syndromes. Three leukocyte-adhesion deficiency (LAD) syndromes have been delineated, and a fourth category of other neutrophil adhesion defects has been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LAD I, in which the beta-2 integrin family is deficient or defective.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LAD II, in which the fucosylated carbohydrate ligands for selectins are absent.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LAD III, in which activation of all beta integrins (1, 2, and 3) is defective.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other defects of neutrophil adhesion.</p><p/><p>The terms &quot;LAD1,&quot; &quot;LAD2,&quot; and &quot;LAD3&quot; were used in a 2015 classification of primary immunodeficiencies, although the author prefers the more commonly used terms above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Issues related to the LAD syndromes will be reviewed here. Other neutrophil disorders and the process of leukocyte-endothelial adhesion during inflammation are discussed separately.

Migration out of the vasculature is first initiated by contact between the leukocyte and the inflamed vascular endothelium. Both the vascular endothelium and leukocytes actively mediate this adhesive interaction, which will be reviewed briefly here. A detailed review of the adhesion cascade is found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leukocyte-endothelial-adhesion-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Leukocyte-endothelial adhesion in the pathogenesis of inflammation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Adhesion molecules</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both leukocytes and vascular endothelial cells express a variety of surface adhesion molecules that help mediate leukocyte trafficking. Three families of adhesive molecules are responsible for the majority of leukocyte-endothelial interactions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F71824\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71824 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Selectins</strong> &ndash; Selectins are found on both leukocytes and endothelial cells and primarily mediate cellular margination and rolling.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Integrins</strong> &ndash; Integrins are largely responsible for adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells and are composed of heterodimers of covalently-associated alpha- and beta-protein chains. Certain members of the beta-1 and beta-2 subclasses of integrins are primarily responsible for the migration of leukocytes into areas of inflammation. Integrins are named and categorized based upon their particular alpha and beta chain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">CD18 is the beta chain common to all members of the beta-2 subclass of integrins, and CD11a, CD11b, and CD11c are the alpha chains associated with lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), macrophage antigen-1 (Mac-1), and glycoprotein <span class=\"nowrap\">150/95</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(gp150/95),</span> respectively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F54103\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54103 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Members of the immunoglobulin superfamily of proteins</strong> &ndash; Immunoglobulin superfamily molecules expressed on endothelial cells interact with integrins on leukocytes and are involved in firm adhesion and transmigration. The molecules of this family that play a role in leukocyte-endothelial adhesion are intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-2 (ICAM-2).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Steps of leukocyte migration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The movement of leukocytes from the bloodstream to the tissue occurs in several distinct steps (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F73528\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73528 \">figure 2</a>). First, under conditions of flow, loose adhesion to the vessel wall causes leukocyte rolling on the endothelium, which primarily occurs in postcapillary venules. This transient and reversible step is a prerequisite for the next stage, the activation of leukocytes. This is followed by firm adhesion (ie, sticking), after which transmigration occurs. Each of these steps involves different adhesion molecules and can be differentially regulated.

It affects phagocyte function rather than neutrophils and was designated as a congenital defect of phagocyte function associated with the syndrome of cystic fibrosis in the 2017 International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS) phenotypic classification for primary immunodeficiencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Leukocyte adhesion and transmigration through endothelial cells were also severely impaired. LAD I is an autosomal recessive genetic disease with mutation in the integrin beta-2 gene (<em>ITGB2</em>) encoding the CD18 subunit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Deficient expression of CD18 leads to impaired T cell function as well, which probably contributes to the severity of the immunodeficiency. In contrast to neutrophil and lymphocyte functions, natural killer activity is not affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Subsequently, the syndrome proved more heterogeneous with the discovery of mutations leading to quantitatively normal but functionally defective CD18. The molecular basis for CD18 deficiency varies, with mutations resulting in aberrant beta mRNA <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are a number of reported point mutations, some of which lead to the biosynthesis of defective proteins with single amino acid substitutions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other mutations lead to splicing defects, resulting in the production of truncated and unstable proteins. Many of these mutations occur in a highly conserved 240 residue domain, which constitutes the binding site of the beta-2 integrins to their ligands, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-2 (ICAM-2).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some genetic defects result in the lack or diminished expression of CD18 mRNA.

In all three, a T cell subset of predominantly cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) expressed CD18. Normal CD18 expression was due to a further mutation in one CD18 allele in these T cell subsets. This somatic mosaicism was associated with a milder clinical phenotype. However, all three patients had inflammatory bowel disease, which suggests that altered regulation of this T cell subset is important to the pathogenesis of this disorder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1181472850\"><span class=\"h3\">Dysregulation of IL-23/IL-17 axis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In tissues susceptible to bacterial invasion (eg, oral mucosa, skin, gastrointestinal mucosa), the presence of microbes induces a physiologic interleukin-23 (IL-23) response under normal conditions. Tissue neutrophils respond by moving into the tissues where they kill micro-organisms. Then, they undergo apoptosis, after which they are phagocytosed by macrophages. This process normally results in subsequent downregulation of IL-23, as well as the downstream cytokines interleukin-17 (IL-17) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), turning off the inflammatory signal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. In the absence of tissue neutrophils in patients with LAD I, inhibition of the <span class=\"nowrap\">IL-23/IL-17</span> axis is deficient, resulting in an unregulated hyperinflammatory response, which leads to chronic inflammation. In patients with LAD I, this process is particularly important in the gingivae but may also be involved in poorly healing cutaneous wounds that often affect these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Evidence for this mechanism includes histochemical and animal studies. A case report described a patient with LAD I who experienced dramatic improvement in periodontitis and healing of a sacral wound with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ustekinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ustekinumab</a>, a monoclonal antibody that binds the p40 subunit shared by interleukin-12 (IL-12) and IL-23 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

This dual classification has been maintained because patients who live into adulthood mainly demonstrate the metabolic manifestations.</p><p>This abnormality in fucosylation in LAD II results in defective rolling of hematopoietic cells, as fucosylated glycoproteins serve as ligands for selectins on endothelial cells. Neutrophils of affected patients fail to bind to purified platelet-derived selectin (P-selectin) and recombinant endothelial-selectin (E-selectin) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

The severity of infections may decrease with time, with adults suffering primarily from periodontitis.</p><p>Nonimmune clinical characteristics are an important feature of LAD II. Affected patients have severe intellectual disabilities, are short in stature, and have a distinctive facial appearance (depressed nasal bridge). Microcephaly and cortical atrophy have been described. Children have delays in motor development, including sitting and walking and in speech. Muscular hypotonia and skeletal abnormalities are also seen. Based upon the few patients who have survived to adulthood, it seems that the immune problems dominate clinically in infancy, while later on in life, the metabolic consequences (CDG-IIc) become more prominent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In a genetic survey of children with short stature and developmental delay, two brothers were found to have a deleterious mutation in <em>SLC35C1</em>, without a leukocyte-adhesion defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As in LAD I, neutrophilia (ranging from 10,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">40,000/mm<sup>3</sup>)</span> is a constant finding, and counts rise further during infection.

This would be particularly important in a very young child in whom developmental delay was not yet apparent, as psychomotor function improved in the one successful case [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Very few centers have experience with this therapy, as it has only been administered to a handful of patients. In the one successful case, the initial dose of fucose was 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> body weight per single dose, which was administered five times per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. This was titrated upwards over nine months to a single dose of 492 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> body weight, given five times per day.</p><p>In this child, fucose supplementation caused a dramatic improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency/abstract/42,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,47</a>]. However, this was not observed in two other patients. This variability is probably explained by the existence of different mutations in the GDP-fucose transporter gene. A mutation that altered substrate affinity could be overcome with excess fucose. By comparison, exogenous fucose administration had no effect on a second mutation associated with normal affinity but slower sugar transport.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is difficult to generalize about the prognosis of LAD II, as so few patients have been reported.

Fewer than 30 patients with LAD III have been reported, many of whom are of Turkish origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency/abstract/48-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-53</a>]. The beta-1, beta-2, and beta-3 integrin families are affected, so both leukocytes (which express beta-1 and -2) and platelets (which express beta-3) are defective.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with LAD III, integrin expression and structure is intact, but there is a defect in integrin activation by physiologic stimuli. Earlier studies identified defects in the &quot;inside-out&quot; intracellular integrin activation processes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency/abstract/51,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,54</a>]. Subsequently, a mutation in the gene for diacylglycerol guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (<em>CalDAG-GEF1</em>) was found (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F63985\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63985 \">figure 5</a>). Although defects in <em>CalDAG-GEF1</em> cause a syndrome resembling LAD III in a mouse model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>], human CalDAG-GEF1 deficiency is characterized with increase bleeding tendency due to defective platelets activation but without any LAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>Following this earlier work, mutations both in the gene for <em>CalDAG-GEF1 </em>and the gene for kindlin-3, <em>FERMT3</em>, were identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Kindlin-3 is an adaptor protein that binds to the intracellular portions of beta-1, -2, and -3 integrins and is believed to enhance their binding to the protein talin at the cell membrane, leading to increased integrin activation and stronger binding of ligands (ie, immunoglobulin superfamily molecules). In some patients with LAD III, other mechanisms appear to activate integrins in the absence of kindlin-3, potentially leading to reduced clinical severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leukocyte-endothelial-adhesion-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammation#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Leukocyte-endothelial adhesion in the pathogenesis of inflammation&quot;, section on 'Adhesion molecules'</a>.)</p><p>Additional patients have been reported with mutations in both <em>CalDAG-GEF1</em> and kindlin-3 or with mutations only in the kindlin-3 gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency/abstract/48,53,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,53,58</a>]. Complementation studies showed that the functional defect can be restored with transfection of normal kindlin-3, while normal <em>CalDAG-GEF1</em> did not correct the defect. Thus mutations of kindlin-3 are considered the main molecular defect underlying LAD III [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency/abstract/48,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,53</a>]. Some patients with mutations only in <em>CalDAG-GEF1</em> were described as having severe bleeding tendency but no LAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>LAD III is characteristic of a group of genetic deficiencies of important adaptor molecules involved in activation of integrins on hematopoietic cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency/abstract/48,54,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,54,60</a>]. Aside from the adhesion defect, natural killer cell activity was also found to be impaired in LAD III [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In LAD III, leukocyte dysfunction leads to severe, recurrent bacterial infections, delayed separation of the umbilical cord, and leukocytosis, similar to the clinical presentation of LAD I. Several patients have had osteoporosis-like bone features, which were attributed to profound adhesion and spreading defects in bone-resorbing osteoclasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p>Dysfunctional platelet aggregation causes bleeding complications, such as cerebral hemorrhage at birth, hematuria, melena, and petechial lesions of the skin and mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

In contrast to the other LAD syndromes, only moderate neutropenia was observed. Neutrophil number increased normally during infection. Reported infections included <em>Pseudomonas</em> omphalitis, recurrent ear and urinary tract infections, severe soft tissue infections, and sepsis.</p><p>There was markedly reduced expression of E-selectin on blood vessels of inflamed tissue with increased levels of circulating soluble E-selectin. This suggests increased cleavage of surface E-selectin. The underlying defect is unclear, as the E-selectin gene sequence was normal in this child.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h2\">Rac2 deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 2 (Rac2) is a Rho-GTPase that is essential for several important neutrophil functions. These include rolling via leukocyte-selectin (L-selectin), filamentous (F)-actin assembly, chemotaxis, and superoxide generation in response to some agonists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>]. Neutrophils from mice deficient in Rac2 have defects in rolling on endothelium, chemotaxis, and phagocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>Rac2 deficiency (also called neutrophil immunodeficiency syndrome, MIM #608203) is a syndrome of global neutrophil dysfunction that was originally described in a male infant with delayed separation of the umbilical cord, poor pus formation, leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and nonhealing perirectal and periumbilical abscesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency/abstract/68-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-70</a>]. In contrast to LAD I, wound biopsies showed appropriate numbers of neutrophils. Defects in rolling on endothelium, chemotaxis, and phagocytosis were observed with the child's neutrophils, as well as in a murine model. A de novo, heterozygous dominant-negative Rac2 mutation was identified as the underlying cause of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p>Infections in this patient healed with granulocyte transfusions.

However, she died of sepsis prior to the exact characterization of the underlying defect.</p><p>A few other patients with Rac2 deficiency have been reported. Similar to the first patient, the second patient also carried a de novo, dominant-negative mutation. Interestingly, this infant was diagnosed at birth following a positive newborn screening for severe combined immunodeficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Clinical manifestations included omphalitis and peritracheal abscess. In addition to neutrophilia and defective chemotaxis, this infant also had CD4+ T cell lymphopenia and hypogammaglobulinemia. Autosomal recessive Rac2 deficiency has been reported in two adult siblings previously diagnosed with common variable immunodeficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. One of them presented in infancy with recurrent pneumonia and membranous glomerulonephritis and subsequently developed urticaria, autoimmune hypothyroidism, hypogammaglobulinemia, and chronic lung disease. This patient died at 21 years of age of complications after hematopoietic cell transplantation. Her brother also suffered from recurrent infections, urticaria, autoimmune hypothyroidism, and hypogammaglobulinemia. Both siblings carried a homozygous <em>RAC2</em> nonsense mutation. There was reduced content of primary and secondary granules in the neutrophils, and chemotaxis was impaired. Na&iuml;ve T cell lymphopenia was present. Overall, these siblings lacked the typical clinical features suggestive of profound neutrophil defect early in life that is observed in patients with LAD, including the first two patients reported with dominant-negative <em>RAC2</em> mutation. It is possible that these dominant-negative mutants also compromise Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) function, thereby affecting neutrophil function more profoundly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13381846\"><span class=\"h2\">Leukocyte-hyperadhesion syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a single patient with delayed cord separation and recurrent skin infections, no leukocytosis was observed, and adhesion molecule expression and genetic sequencing were normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].

These include abnormal endothelial-selectin (E-selectin) expression and Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 2 (Rac-2) deficiency. (See <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Other syndromes of defective neutrophil adhesion'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35\"><span class=\"h2\">LAD I</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LAD I is characterized clinically by recurrent bacterial infections, a persistent neutrophilia that increases markedly during infection, absent pus formation (a hallmark finding), and impaired wound healing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F81988\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81988 \">picture 2</a>). A classic presenting infection is omphalitis, with delayed separation of the umbilical cord (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63960%7EPEDS%2F71634\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63960 graphicRef71634 \">picture 1A-B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'LAD I'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LAD I should be considered in any infant with recurrent soft tissue infection and a very high leukocyte count. The diagnosis is made by demonstrating the absence of both CD18 and the associated alpha subunit molecules (CD11a, CD11b, and CD11c) by flow cytometry using CD11 and CD18 monoclonal antibodies. Severe and moderate phenotypes are delineated based upon the degree of leukocyte CD18 expression. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with moderate LAD I require meticulous oral and dental care to control periodontitis and oral infections and prompt and complete treatment of other bacterial infections as they arise. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Management and prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with severe LAD I and acceptably matched donors are candidates for hematopoietic cell transplantation. Gene therapy may be available in the future. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Severe phenotype'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37\"><span class=\"h2\">LAD II</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LAD II results from the absence of fucosylated carbohydrate ligands on hematopoietic cells. Because these glycoproteins serve as ligands for selectins, this abnormality results in defective rolling of leukocytes. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'LAD II'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with LAD II have less severe and fewer infections than those with LAD I. Skin, lung, and periodontal infections are common, although generally not life-threatening. However, nonimmunologic sequelae are prominent, as affected patients have severe intellectual disabilities, short stature, and a distinctive facial appearance (depressed nasal bridge). Children have delays in motor development and speech (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66375\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66375 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'LAD II'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis should be suspected in children with neutrophilia and psychomotor impairment. The presence of the Bombay blood group in such a child strongly suggests the diagnosis. Flow cytometry demonstrates the absence of sialyl Lewis X expression (CD15a), and the diagnosis is confirmed with sequence analysis of the gene encoding the guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-fucose transporter. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with LAD II require careful oral and dental care to control periodontitis and oral infections and prompt and complete treatment of other bacterial infections as they arise. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For young children with frequent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severe infections despite the above measures, we suggest prophylactic administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We administer a dose of 5 mg per kg once daily. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not usually needed once the child exceeds about five years of age. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest a trial of fucose supplementation in all patients with LAD II (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This is most likely to be successful in patients diagnosed early in life. The initial dose of fucose is 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> body weight (per dose), administered five times daily. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Fucose supplementation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H39\"><span class=\"h2\">LAD III</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LAD III is a rare, autosomal recessive syndrome that results from defective integrin activation by physiologic stimuli. Both leukocytes and platelets are affected, resulting in severe bacterial infections, similar to those seen in LAD I, as well as bleeding complications due to defective platelet function (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66375\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66375 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'LAD III'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis requires a demonstration of impaired integrin activation with intact integrin expression and mutations in the kindlin-3 gene. These studies are performed in a few select laboratories. (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with severe LAD III and acceptably matched donors, hematopoietic cell transplantation may correct the presumed hematopoietic defect. (See <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Treatment and prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H647556595\"><span class=\"h2\">LAD IV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is an addition disorder named LAD IV, which is a phagocyte disorder. (See <a href=\"#H558519611\" class=\"local\">'LAD IV'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4244497604\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge E Richard Stiehm, MD, who contributed as a Section Editor to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Etzioni A.
