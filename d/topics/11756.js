When the nipple is pulled in and points inward instead of out, it is termed nipple inversion or retraction. Nipple inversion can affect one breast or both and can be congenital or acquired. Acquired nipple inversion can be due to benign or malignant causes. Benign nipple inversion is usually a gradual process, occurring over a few years. When nipple inversion occurs rapidly, the underlying cause can be inflammation, postsurgical changes, or an underlying malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-inversion/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The evaluation and management of nipple inversion will be reviewed here. Nipple discharge, common breast problems, and the diagnostic evaluation of a suspected breast cancer are discussed elsewhere.

The nipple is initially an epidermal pit and eventually everts as the fetus nears gestation. An inverted nipple may represent a failure of this eversion during development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-inversion/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Breast development and Tanner staging are depicted in the figure and are discussed in detail elsewhere (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72038\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72038 \">picture 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-development-and-morphology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast development and morphology&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The color of the nipple and areola is initially imparted by blood vessels coursing near the skin. Melanin is deposited in the basal cells as part of the aging process, thereby darkening the nipple-areolar complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-inversion/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13131670\"><span class=\"h1\">NIPPLE ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The normal nipple projects from the central area of the areola (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F88523\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef88523 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F64544\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64544 \">figure 3</a>). The darkly pigmented areola, located in the center of the breast, contains dense collagen fibers and a thin layer of contractile muscle. While there is significant variation in color, shape, size, and projection of the nipple-areola complex, a study of morphologic characteristics in 300 women reported a mean nipple height of 0.9 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-inversion/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Differences in nipple projection can be affected by age, race, weight, and hormonal changes.</p><p>In the normal nipple, areolar muscle contraction results in nipple projection. Nipple inversion occurs when the contractile forces of the areolar muscles are unable to overcome tension between the central ducts and the skin of the nipple.</p><p>On the surface of the nipple, approximately five to nine central ductal orifices extend posteriorly toward the pectoralis muscle. A smaller number of ducts originate within the areola itself. Below the level of the areolar skin, the ducts of the central bundle taper down to a narrowed area or &quot;waist&quot; at the level of the superficial fascia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-inversion/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Each orifice communicates with a separate ductal system of the breast and connects to terminal duct lobular units within the breast parenchyma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-inversion/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. During lactation, milk produced in the terminal duct lobular units travels through lactiferous ducts and sinuses and is ejected from ductal orifices in the nipple papilla as shown in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F71740\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71740 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p>The vascular supply to the breast is derived from the external mammary artery, cutaneous perforators of the internal mammary and fourth and fifth intercostal arteries, and musculocutaneous perforators of the thoracoacromial artery. The vascular supply to the nipple-areolar complex is derived from branches of the internal mammary artery, with contributions from branches of both the anterior intercostal arteries and the lateral thoracic artery. These branches travel in the subcutaneous tissue and communicate transversely above and below the areola. Branches from the communicating vessels above and below the areola run toward the base of the nipple and give off smaller vessels to the areolar skin in a circular distribution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-inversion/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14508220\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classification of nipple inversion is based upon appearance, whether the nipple can be pulled out manually, and how well projection is maintained.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31853443\"><span class=\"h2\">Nipple retraction versus nipple inversion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the terms &quot;nipple inversion&quot; and &quot;nipple retraction&quot; are often used interchangeably, there is a distinct difference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-inversion/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nipple retraction occurs when only a part of the nipple is drawn in because it is tethered by a single duct, resulting in a slit-like appearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F75440\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75440 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nipple inversion occurs when the entire nipple is pulled in.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31853515\"><span class=\"h2\">Umbilicated versus invaginated nipples</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Umbilicated nipples can be pulled out from beneath the alveolar surface without maximal force, while invaginated nipples cannot be extracted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-inversion/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31853508\"><span class=\"h2\">Grading system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical grading system for nipple inversion is based upon how difficult it is to pull the nipple out manually and how well projection is subsequently maintained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-inversion/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade I &ndash; The nipple is easily pulled out with gentle squeezing of the areolar skin.

This disorder is a progression of inflammatory changes from normal breast ducts to duct ectasia, followed by periductal mastitis, subareolar abscess, and periareolar fistula formation. Chronic inflammation of the duct wall and periductal tissue may be sterile or bacterial and can lead to subsequent fibrosis of the duct wall and nipple inversion.</p><p>The etiology of ductal inflammation is unclear, although a number of hypotheses have been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-inversion/abstract/19-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-23</a>]. However, no single mechanism clearly explains the pathogenesis of ductal inflammation, and a number of processes probably occur independently or together and are modified by age, anatomy, and smoking history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-inversion/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14509242\"><span class=\"h3\">Duct ectasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nipple inversion associated with duct ectasia usually involves the nipple but not the areola, as shown in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F57055\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57055 \">picture 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-inversion/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The nipples are usually easily everted. In contrast, nipple inversion from a carcinoma tends to distort the areola when the breast is examined in different positions. Duct ectasia presents with a longstanding history of bilateral symmetrical central nipple inversion and a creamy or greenish nipple discharge.

For this technique, a small incision is made at the 6 o'clock position and a 4-mm, 30-degree endoscope is advanced to better differentiate between subcutaneous normal ducts, contracted ducts, fibrous band, vessels, and nerves. With improved visualization, normal ducts can be preserved while successfully dividing fibrous bands and retracted ducts. In an observational series of 23 such procedures, the nipples were judged to have an excellent result, and there were no changes in sensation reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-inversion/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31853272\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin flaps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Triangular skin flaps can be mobilized to add bulk to the base of the nipple and, when closed, tighten the neck of the nipple. Another technique is to use two broad, triangular areolar skin flaps on opposite ends of the nipple [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-inversion/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The restricting subareolar fibrous bands <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ducts are released, and the flaps are then advanced through a tunnel beneath the nipple to fill dead space created by the dissection. The tip of each flap is fixed with the base of the other flap, and the tissue is reapproximated to tighten the nipple neck. In their series of 14 cases, there were no recurrences at follow-up ranging from 3 to 18 months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20903931\"><span class=\"h2\">Percutaneous release</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Percutaneous release of nipple inversion can be accomplished with a wire subcision technique or with a simple minimally invasive technique using a needle tip for lysis of retracted ducts:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31853296\"><span class=\"h3\">Wire subcision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Subcision releases the dermis from the tissue below. In the wire subcision technique, entry and exit points are created at the 6 and 12 o'clock positions with the introduction of a wire scalpel (Diamond Wire scalpel) after placing the nipple on traction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-inversion/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The wire scalpel is inserted inferiorly and directed around retracted tissue to exit superiorly at 12 o'clock. A second wire is placed through the same sites. By pulling the two ends back and forth, tethered tissue between the two wires is divided. The wires are removed and a horizontal mattress suture with 4-0 chromic is placed to maintain the everted nipple in position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-inversion/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31853308\"><span class=\"h3\">Needle tip lysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Needle tip lysis is a simple minimally invasive technique for lysis of retracted ducts. For this technique, an 18-gauge needle tip is inserted at the 6 o'clock position and used to lyse fibrous tissue and tethered glands until satisfactory nipple projection has been achieved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-inversion/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Following this, a monofilament purse string suture is placed, starting at the entry site, with entry and exit through the same stitch point every 3 to 5 mm around the nipple base. The suture is then tied under moderate tension. In a series of 58 inverted nipples in 31 patients, there were 13 recurrences, of which 11 were successfully treated with a second purse-string suture and two required a third procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-inversion/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14508315\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The nipple is the central projection in the areola. When the nipple is pulled in and points inward instead of out, it is termed nipple inversion or retraction. Nipple inversion can affect one breast or both and can be congenital or acquired. (See <a href=\"#H14508206\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical grading system for nipple inversion is based on how difficult it is to pull the nipple out manually and how well projection is subsequently maintained. (See <a href=\"#H14508220\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Congenital nipple inversion is benign and usually bilateral. The cause of congenital nipple inversion is a failure of the underlying mesenchymal tissue to proliferate and project the nipple papilla outward. (See <a href=\"#H14509235\" class=\"local\">'Congenital nipple inversion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acquired nipple inversion can be a result of inflammation, malignancy, or surgery. (See <a href=\"#H14508235\" class=\"local\">'Acquired nipple inversion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A thorough evaluation is required for new onset of acquired nipple inversion. This workup should include physical exam, imaging, and biopsy of any suspicious findings. (See <a href=\"#H14508286\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of nipple inversion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with benign disease may wish to have correction of their inversion for cosmetic reasons. For many women, inverted nipples can be a source of aesthetic and functional concern, leading to self-consciousness and psychological distress. The goal of surgical correction is to restore projection while maintaining the ductal anatomy as much as possible. (See <a href=\"#H14508308\" class=\"local\">'Surgical correction of benign nipple inversion'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-inversion/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Da Costa D, Taddese A, Cure ML, et al.
