Photosensitized tissue is subsequently exposed to light (usually 48 hours later) (see <a href=\"#H80979489\" class=\"local\">'Bronchoscopic phototherapy'</a> below). The light induces a type II photo-oxidative intracellular reaction, in which molecular oxygen is transformed to singlet reactive oxygen species (ROS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endobronchial-photodynamic-therapy-in-the-management-of-airway-disease-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The presence of excessive amounts of intracellular ROS results in cell death and, consequently, tissue necrosis.</p><p>Tumor cells and the neovascular endothelium of tumors preferentially retain the photosensitizer such that the cytotoxic reaction is somewhat selective for neoplastic cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endobronchial-photodynamic-therapy-in-the-management-of-airway-disease-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Capillary damage and tumor necrosis begin within hours after illumination; however, the maximal clinical effect of tissue destruction takes a few days to be appreciated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Light source</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A light source, typically administered via a bronchoscope, with a specific wavelength (eg, optimal wavelength for photofrin is 630 nm) is required for photodynamic therapy (PDT) to be effective. Tissue is typically destroyed to a depth of approximately 5 to 10 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endobronchial-photodynamic-therapy-in-the-management-of-airway-disease-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] (see <a href=\"#H80979489\" class=\"local\">'Bronchoscopic phototherapy'</a> below). The most commonly used light source is the diode laser (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F104815\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef104815 \">picture 1</a>). Since these lasers emit nonthermal laser light, the effects of PDT are not immediate; however, the nonthermal property eliminates the risk of airway fire, an adverse effect that may occur with thermal techniques (eg, bronchoscopic laser, electrocautery, or argon plasma coagulation) if the FiO<sub>2</sub> is higher than 0.4. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchoscopic-laser-in-the-management-of-airway-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bronchoscopic laser in the management of airway disease in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endobronchial-electrocautery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endobronchial electrocautery&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchoscopic-argon-plasma-coagulation-in-the-management-of-airway-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bronchoscopic argon plasma coagulation in the management of airway disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Dosimetry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Total energy delivered depends upon the timing of illumination after injection of the photosensitizing agent and the energy delivered through the fiber:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Timing &ndash; According to the drug package insert, endoscopic introduction of the light source should be scheduled 40 to 50 hours after injection. In practice, most interventionalists generally schedule light application approximately 24 to 72 hours after injection (usually 48 hours). This allows for the sensitizer to wash out of normal mucosa, thus minimizing damage to adjacent nonmalignant tissue. Treatment at shorter times will lead to indiscriminate damage because there is equal concentration of photosensitizing agent in tumor and normal tissues. The concentration is sufficient in the tumor for approximately five to seven days, thus making a second light application effective at the clean-up bronchoscopy (three days after first treatment and five days after injection).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Energy &ndash; It is recommended initially to apply 200 Joules per cm treated (range 50 to 300 Joules); higher amounts of energy may be administered for larger lesions in the trachea and mainstem bronchi, while smaller amounts are usually administered for smaller distal lesions. Additional energy may be applied during a follow-up bronchoscopy two days later. Additional photosensitizer should not be administered any more than every six weeks to limit toxicity.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H103488341\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS AND EFFICACY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) therapy is typically a palliative or adjunctive therapy used to relieve non-life-threatening symptomatic airway obstruction (eg, dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis) due to malignant or, less commonly, benign conditions that are not amenable to first-line therapies. It may also be used to treat patients with inoperable radiographic occult lung cancer (ROLC) or patients with stump recurrence following resective surgery. Ideal lesions are intraluminal and short (ie, &lt; 1 to 1.5 cm) and with an endoluminal surface that is without significant necrotic debris; extrinsic lesions should <strong>not</strong> be treated with PDT.</p><p>The management of patients with central airway obstruction and the choice of modality used to treat this population, including locally ablative bronchoscopic techniques, are discussed separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72854\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72854 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F64246\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64246 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management-of-central-airway-obstruction-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and management of central airway obstruction in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H80979126\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway obstruction</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H80979138\"><span class=\"h3\">Malignant</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H326785587\"><span class=\"h4\">Tumor or patient characteristics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptomatic airway obstruction from bronchogenic carcinoma is the most common indication for bronchoscopic PDT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55320\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55320 \">table 3</a>). In general, it is a palliative therapy used in patients for whom other first-line treatment modalities are not feasible (eg, surgery or radiation therapy). Occasionally, it is used adjunctively before salvage chemotherapy, radiation (eg, external beam radiation or brachytherapy), or surgical resection. For optimal effects, lung units distal to the obstruction should be functioning or &quot;recruitable,&quot; and repeated therapies are sometimes required.</p><p>Selecting patients who have tumors likely to respond to PDT is critical. Similar to patients with lung cancer who present with mediastinal or parenchymal masses, patients with airway malignancy should undergo an identical staging process, during which computed tomography (CT), white-light bronchoscopy, and endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) are typically performed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109805\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109805 \">table 4</a>). This process is important for several reasons (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the initial evaluation, diagnosis, and staging of patients with suspected lung cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selection-of-modality-for-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-non-small-cell-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selection of modality for diagnosis and staging of patients with suspected non-small cell lung cancer&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Assessing tumor extent</strong> &ndash; For most patients with intraluminal tumor, but in particular those with post-resectional stump recurrence and ROLC (ie, early lung cancer or carcinoma-in-situ) for which PDT is being considered (often with a curative intent), radial EBUS evaluation of tumor extent is particularly important since assessment without EBUS frequently leads to underestimation of tumor invasion in the airway wall and reduced efficacy of PDT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endobronchial-photodynamic-therapy-in-the-management-of-airway-disease-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The identification of additional tumors, mediastinal, hilar or interlobar nodal involvement, or tumor beyond the airway wall may result in the avoidance of PDT and prompt alternate therapies (eg, radiotherapy). (See <a href=\"#H80979151\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic occult lung cancer'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Assessing tumor characteristics</strong> &ndash; For all patients with symptomatic airway obstruction from an intraluminal tumor, assessing the macroscopic tumor characteristics are easily performed prior to PDT with white-light bronchoscopy and CT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Ideal lesions are short, typically &lt;1 to 1.5 cm (ie, no longer than the length of the light diffuser). Lesions that are deep or shallow and lesions that are associated with complete or partial obstruction that is non-life-threatening can be treated with PDT. However, necrotic debris and blood interfere with light penetration such that mechanical debridement with a rigid bronchoscope, cryotherapy or a variety of flexible bronchoscopic techniques prior to PDT is required in such cases. Although most cases of airway obstruction are located centrally (ie, trachea and mainstem bronchi), lesions down to the second or third order of bronchi can be successfully treated with PDT, which is an advantage over bronchoscopic laser, where there is increased risk of airway and vessel perforation in lobar and segmental airways</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Long, extensive lesions of the airway cannot be effectively treated with PDT, and patency beyond the level of obstruction is usually necessary for PDT to be effective. Since PDT requires direct or close contact with the tumor for it to be effective, it cannot be used for lesions that cause external compression (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F104814\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef104814 \">image 1</a>). In addition, it should not be used for tumors associated with life-threatening obstruction (ie, critical tracheal or bilateral mainstem bronchial tumors), since its effect is not immediate. These and other contraindications are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H103488780\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Although laser, electrocautery, and argon plasma coagulation are bronchoscopic ablative therapies that are immediate acting, PDT is longer lasting, may have a survival benefit when compared with neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd;YAG) laser [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endobronchial-photodynamic-therapy-in-the-management-of-airway-disease-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] and can be used following ablation to maintain local control of large, bulky tumors.

Most cases of airway obstruction were located in the mainstem bronchi (&gt;50 percent); one case was located in the trachea, and the remainder were in the second and third order bronchi (eg, bronchus intermedius, orifice of the right middle or lower lobe).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective study of 100 patients with airway obstruction due to advanced inoperable bronchogenic cancer (mostly NSCLC), mean endoluminal obstruction fell from 86 to 18 percent, and lung function improved as evidenced by an increase in mean forced vital capacity (increased by 430 mL) and forced expiratory volume in one second (increased by 280 mL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endobronchial-photodynamic-therapy-in-the-management-of-airway-disease-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Median survival was five months, and overall two-year survival was 1 percent.</p><p/><p>Case reports also describe successful use of PDT as an adjunctive therapy (eg, PDT plus chemotherapy, sleeve lobectomy, bronchoscopic laser, or bronchoscopic brachytherapy) in the treatment of NSCLC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endobronchial-photodynamic-therapy-in-the-management-of-airway-disease-in-adults/abstract/18-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-23</a>]. Similarly, it has been used successfully for local control in patients with intractable endobronchial disease who have failed other therapies (eg, surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endobronchial-photodynamic-therapy-in-the-management-of-airway-disease-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Whether ionizing radiation can activate <a href=\"topic.htm?path=porfimer-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">porfimer</a> sodium (Photofrin) has not been studied. Therefore, it is recommended that two to four weeks be allowed after PDT before starting radiotherapy. Similarly, if PDT is to be given after radiotherapy, the acute inflammatory reaction from radiotherapy usually subsides within four weeks after completing radiotherapy, after which PDT may be given. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H326786697\"><span class=\"h4\">Comparison with other ablative procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there are no high-quality studies comparing the use of PDT with other bronchoscopic ablative therapies, when used appropriately, they all appear to result in similar rates of airway patency and symptom palliation (hemoptysis, dyspnea, cough). As an example, in one randomized trial of 31 patients with inoperable NSCLC that directly compared PDT with bronchoscopic laser, both treatments resulted in similar rates of symptom palliation (&gt;80 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endobronchial-photodynamic-therapy-in-the-management-of-airway-disease-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, the effects of PDT were longer lasting.</p><p>Choosing which therapy to use in patients with obstructing airway tumors is dependent upon the tumor and patient characteristics, as well as local expertise, and should therefore be individualized for each patient. In addition, in practice, a combination of local therapies is often used to optimize and maintain patency. Among these modalities, only PDT and brachytherapy are longer lasting than the others. PDT has a shallower depth of penetration when compared with neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser, thus, PDT as a nonthermal modality may be used without the increased risk of airway fire or perforation that is common with the thermal techniques. The advantages and disadvantages of each bronchoscopic modality and choosing among the therapeutic options (both immediate-acting and maintenance therapies) in patients with airway obstruction are discussed in detail separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72854\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72854 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F64246\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64246 \">table 2</a>).

The team usually includes a bronchoscopist, an endoscopy nurse, and an anesthesiologist with expertise in airway management. The materials needed include a photosensitizing agent, a bronchoscope (flexible <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rigid), and a laser light source. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=supraglottic-devices-including-laryngeal-mask-airways-for-airway-management-for-anesthesia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Supraglottic devices (including laryngeal mask airways) for airway management for anesthesia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H80979483\"><span class=\"h2\">Photosensitizing agent administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Agents used are generally a mixture of different porphyrin-based oligomers.

A standard dose of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> is injected intravenously slowly over 5 to 10 minutes. The drug is cleared from most organs within 72 hours but is retained longer in tumors, skin (up to 30 days), liver, and spleen.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Phototoxic reaction'</a> above.)</p><p>The light source is introduced via a flexible or rigid bronchoscope, usually the former. However, the use of a rigid bronchoscope may be preferable in patients who are unstable or significantly hypoxemic or in those in whom the procedure is estimated to be prolonged</p><p>Once the tumor is visualized and ensuring that the surface is clear of surface debris, the light source is delivered through the working channel of a flexible bronchoscope or through the open barrel of a rigid bronchoscope such that it is 2 to 3 cm away from the distal end of the bronchoscope.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The chosen diffuser length depends upon the length of the lesion. Diffusing fibers are mounted at the tip of a one meter fiberoptic cable, which can be placed in the biopsy channel of most flexible bronchoscopes and is fitted with a connector for easy attachment to the light source. Standard diffusers are 1.07 mm (flexible diffuser) or 1.7 mm (rigid diffuser) in diameter with available lengths of 10, 15, 20, 25, 50 mm. Other lengths can be manufactured on request. Ideally, the diffuser length should roughly equal the tumor vertical extent. If the lesion is longer than the chosen diffuser, the light fiber is repositioned to the non-treated area, and an additional light application is administered until the entire tumor has been treated (typically estimated visually). Each treatment takes approximately eight minutes, and no more than three to four treatments per session are administered. If the lesion is smaller than the chosen diffuser, a short fiber (10 mm) or microlens can be employed to focus light in a forward direction if required to treat small superficial tumors, radiographic occult tumors, or a stump recurrence. The most commonly used design is a cylindrical diffuser, which emits light laterally in a 360 degree arc near its tip (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F81291\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81291 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If possible, the entire length of the diffuser, which can be rigid or flexible should be embedded into the lesion since PDT works best by transillumination. This not only protects healthy mucosa from light exposure but also delivers more energy to the tumor itself. Inserting the tip is difficult to perform for lesions smaller than 0.5 cm as well as nonobstructing lesions. In such cases, the fiber should be as close to the lesion as possible to avoid light attenuation through air (ie, adjacent location) In addition, for hypervascular lesions, we prefer that the probe be adjacent to the target tissue rather than embedded in the lesion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the diffuser is in place, light is applied at a typical initial energy of 200 Joules per cm (range is 50 to 300 Joules). This usually takes six to eight minutes with a diode laser. Higher amounts of energy may be administered for large, central lesions, while lower amounts are usually administered for small, distal lesions. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Dosimetry'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After the light has been applied, the probe is removed, secretions are suctioned, and the bronchoscope is removed.</p><p/><p>Tissue remains sensitive to light for up to three to six weeks such that PDT can be repeated without re-administering the photosensitizing agent during this period. Some centers perform one PDT session only, while others routinely perform two sessions (eg, one initial session and a second at the time of follow-up bronchoscopy). However, in our experience, the number of sessions varies depending on the tumor size and tumor response. Follow-up bronchoscopy for secretion clearance is most frequently performed within three to four days after each illumination, during which time repeat illumination of the target lesion may be performed if additional response is needed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F54311%7EPULM%2F57883%7EPULM%2F68408\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54311 graphicRef57883 graphicRef68408 \">picture 3A-C</a>).

Patients can remain susceptible to sunlight for up to six weeks following injection. The necessary precautions and the treatment of sunburn are discussed separately. Surgical procedures may be performed at any time during the PDT treatment. In some cases, PDT is scheduled specifically to coincide with operative intervention. No photosensitization has occurred, since patients are covered in protective standard surgical draping. Although there are no data on timing of PDT and ionizing radiation therapy, there is a theoretical risk that radiation (a photon source) may activate the drug. However, there are no reports of adverse effects of PDT and radiation therapy. Because of the lack of definitive data, it is probably prudent to plan a two to four week interval between sensitizer injection and the initiation of ionizing radiation.

(See <a href=\"#H80979489\" class=\"local\">'Bronchoscopic phototherapy'</a> above.)</p><p>Although not mandatory, many clinicians perform repeat bronchoscopy at six weeks to assess PDT efficacy (eg, degree of airway patency).

Sunscreen does <strong>not </strong>provide effective protection, since it does not filter all visible wavelengths. Shaded light, light from most artificial light sources, and light from television do not generally pose problems. However, if it is predicted that the patient will be in strong artificial light for a prolonged period (eg, operating room or intensive care unit), covering their skin to avoid skin activation is prudent. The protection against and treatment of phototoxicity are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cutaneous-photosensitivity-photobiology-patient-evaluation-and-photoprotection#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cutaneous photosensitivity: Photobiology, patient evaluation, and photoprotection&quot;, section on 'Photoprotection'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=photosensitivity-disorders-photodermatoses-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Photosensitivity disorders (photodermatoses): Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bronchoscopic photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a nonthermal ablative technique that can be used to treat central airway disease in adults. A photosensitizing agent, which is administered systemically, is preferentially taken up by neoplastic tissue. Approximately 48 hours later, photosensitized tissue is exposed to light of a specific wavelength, which induces a cytotoxic reaction, resulting in cell death and tissue necrosis. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H103488805\" class=\"local\">'Principles of photodynamic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bronchoscopic PDT is typically a palliative or adjunctive therapy used to relieve non-life-threatening symptomatic airway obstruction due to malignancy (usually non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC]) that is not amenable to first-line therapies. Less commonly, it may be used to treat hemoptysis due to airway lesions, inoperable benign conditions of the airway (eg, stenosis, papillomatosis, granulation tissue), inoperable radiographic occult lung cancer (ROLC), and stump recurrence following resective surgery. Ideal lesions are intraluminal and short with an endoluminal surface that is without significant necrotic debris. In most patients (up to 80 percent), PDT can palliate the symptoms associated with airway disease. (See <a href=\"#H103488341\" class=\"local\">'Indications and efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with extrinsic lesions and life-threatening airway symptoms should<strong> not</strong> be treated with PDT. In addition, PDT should be avoided in those at risk of adverse effects from bronchoscopy, <span class=\"nowrap\">sedation/anesthesia,</span> or worsening respiratory failure from necrotic debris, as well as in those with known photosensitivity or lesions adjacent to a major blood vessel. (See <a href=\"#H103488780\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PDT should only be performed by experts skilled in its use. Adequate anesthesia is mandatory in order to eliminate coughing and inadvertent repositioning of the light source during the procedure. The photosensitizing agent is injected intravenously (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=porfimer-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">porfimer</a> sodium 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span>. Approximately 48 hours later, a light source, typically diode laser, is introduced via a flexible or rigid bronchoscope. The laser diffuser should preferentially be embedded into the lesion or placed as close to it as possible. Light is applied at a typical initial energy of 200 Joules per cm (range is 50 to 300 Joules) with no more than three or four treatments per lesion in one session. The probe is removed, secretions are suctioned, and the bronchoscope is removed. (See <a href=\"#H80979399\" class=\"local\">'Procedure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications can be PDT specific or due to bronchoscopy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> procedural sedation. They occur in 5 to 15 percent of patients, with photosensitivity as the most common reported PDT-specific adverse reaction. Other PDT-related complications include airway edema and secretions that can worsen respiratory failure, as well as hemoptysis and chest pain. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bronchoscopic PDT does not require any particular, immediate follow-up care in the absence of complications, other than that required routinely for bronchoscopy and incentive spirometry for secretion clearance. However, repeat bronchoscopy is generally required within two to three days for clearance of endobronchial debris, during which time repeat illumination is sometimes performed, if necessary. After six weeks, repeat PDT may be planned for the future (eg, six weeks or longer), depending upon the observed response. In the special case of curative-intent PDT for early airway squamous cell carcinoma, scheduled surveillance flexible bronchoscopy is recommended.
