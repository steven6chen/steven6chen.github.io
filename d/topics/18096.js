For example, if symptoms occur primarily at home, something in that environment may be involved. If symptoms flare in the spring or fall, an outdoor allergy, such as tree or ragweed pollen, respectively, is more likely to blame.</p><p>Using blood tests or skin tests can provide additional information about possible asthma triggers by determining if a person is sensitive (or allergic) to a particular substance.</p><p>Once asthma triggers have been identified, the person has several options:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid the trigger entirely</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limit exposure to the trigger if it cannot be completely avoided</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If exposure to the trigger can be predicted, consult with a health care provider about taking an extra dose of medicine before exposure to the trigger</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunotherapy (allergy shots) can be helpful for allergic triggers (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergic-rhinitis-seasonal-allergies-beyond-the-basics#H19\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Allergic rhinitis (seasonal allergies) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;, section on 'Allergy shots'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INDOOR ASTHMA TRIGGERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Allergens are substances that can cause an allergic reaction and are major triggers in many people with asthma. Sensitivity to indoor allergens is especially common in asthmatics. The most common indoor allergens that affect asthmatics include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dust mites</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mold</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Animal danders (skin, fur, feathers, saliva)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cockroaches</p><p/><p>The bedroom of the asthmatic person should be given special consideration because the greatest number of hours are typically spent there. However, to be effective, multifaceted and thorough measures may be needed to reduce all relevant allergens throughout the home.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Dust mites</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dust mites are microscopic organisms that are present in most households. They avoid light and absorb humidity from the atmosphere (ie, they do not drink). The highest concentrations of mites are in mattresses, but they may be found in other bedding, upholstered furniture, carpets, curtains, house dust, or any woven material if the humidity is high enough [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigger-avoidance-in-asthma-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Measures that help limit exposure to dust mites are detailed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79168\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79168 \">table 1</a>) and include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Create a physical barrier to the source of the mites by covering pillows and mattresses with plastic or another impermeable fabric cover designed for this purpose. Note that dust mite covers should not be confused with &quot;hypoallergenic&quot; bedding covers that are made of unbleached or organic cotton and are intended for people who have contact sensitivities to fabric dyes. Cotton covers are not useful for containing dust mites.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decrease the population of dust mites in the home by washing bedding and pillows in hot water and detergent or drying them in an electric dryer on the hot setting once per week.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remove carpets from the bedroom. Minimize the number of stuffed toys in the child's bedroom and wash them weekly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Control humidity. Mites thrive in humid environments. Opening windows in dry climates and using air conditioning in humid ones decreases humidity in the home and reduces the number of mites. Avoid using a humidifier.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using a mop or vacuum instead of a broom to clean the floor and surfaces may reduce exposure to aerosolized dust.</p><p/><p>Moving to or spending more time on upper floors of buildings may help, as upper floors tend to be less humid than lower floors or basements. The household humidity should be between 30 and 50 percent, if possible. Inexpensive humidity monitors can be purchased at most hardware stores.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Mold</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mold spores can be found indoors in damp environments and trigger symptoms of asthma and allergic rhinitis in mold-allergic patients. Areas such as air conditioning vents, water traps, refrigerator drip trays, shower stalls, leaky sinks, and damp basements are particularly vulnerable to mold growth.</p><p>To reduce the growth of mold, it is necessary to remove existing mold and reduce humidity to prevent future growth of mold. Humidity can be reduced by removing sources of standing water and persistent dampness. Specific measures include removing house plants, fixing leaky plumbing, correcting sinks and showers that do not drain completely, and removing bathroom or basement carpeting that is exposed to steam or moisture. Damp areas should be dehumidified to levels below 50 percent.</p><p>Indoor garbage pails should be regularly disinfected, and an electric dehumidifier should be used to remove moisture from the basement. Old books, newspapers, clothing, and bedding are potential reservoirs for mold and may need to be discarded. Water-damaged carpets should be thrown out because it is difficult or impossible to eliminate mold in this situation, even with thorough cleaning.</p><p>Mold thrives on soap film that covers tiles, sinks, and grout. Sinks, tubs, and other surfaces with visible mold growth should be cleaned at least every four weeks. Various cleaning agents can be used, such as white vinegar, borax, detergent, or dilute bleach (eg, 1 ounce [30 mL] bleach diluted in 1 quart [1 liter] of water). Other surfaces with visible mold growth should also be cleaned. The use of bleach by people with asthma is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Chemicals'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Animal danders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Animal dander is made up of the dead skin cells or scales (like dandruff) that are constantly shed by animals. Asthma can be triggered by proteins from the &quot;dander,&quot; saliva, and urine of common house pets, such as cats and dogs. Any breed of dog and cat is capable of being allergenic, although the levels given off by individual animals may vary to some degree. In cats, the protein that causes most people's allergies is found in the cat's saliva, skin glands, and <span class=\"nowrap\">urinary/reproductive</span> tract. Accordingly, short-haired cats are not necessarily less allergenic than long-haired animals, and furless cats have allergens that are similar to furred cats.</p><p>Other warm-blooded animals, such as rodents, birds, and ferrets can also trigger asthma in an allergic individual. Pets without feathers or fur, such as reptiles, turtles, and fish, rarely cause allergy, although deposits of fish food that build up under the covers of fish tanks are an excellent source of food for dust mite colonies.</p><p>If a person with asthma is found to be allergic to a pet, the most effective option is to remove the pet from the home.</p><p>Limiting an animal to a certain area in the house is not effective, because some allergens are carried on clothing or spread in the air. Once a pet has left a home, careful cleaning of carpets, sofas, curtains, and bedding must follow. This is particularly true for cat allergens because they are &quot;sticky&quot; and adhere to a variety of indoor surfaces. Even after a cat has been removed from a home and it has been thoroughly cleaned, it can take months for the level of cat allergens to drop. For this reason, it may take months for the allergic person's symptoms to fully reflect the absence of the pet.</p><p>If it is not possible to remove the animal, measures can be taken to decrease exposure to the animal dander (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F58126\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58126 \">table 2</a>), although none of these methods is as effective as removing the animal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Cockroaches</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cockroaches can shed or excrete particles that contain allergens that have been shown to trigger asthma in sensitive individuals. Cockroaches thrive in warm environments with easily accessible food and water. Unfortunately, efforts to control cockroach populations in infested areas are often less than successful. Still, certain measures are recommended, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using multiple baited traps or poisons</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Removing garbage and food waste promptly from the home</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Washing dishes and cooking utensils immediately after use</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Removing cockroach debris quickly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eliminating any standing water from leaking faucets or drains</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">The role of air filters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Air filtering devices, including high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, other mechanical filters, and electrostatic filters, are widely advertised to reduce indoor allergens. These may be marketed as components of heating or cooling systems, as individual units for use in a room or area, or as units that are worn by individuals. These devices are expensive, and few have been scientifically proven to significantly improve allergy symptoms.</p><p>Certain types of air filters (eg, ionizers) produce ozone, which is a respiratory irritant for some people. These devices have not been proven safe or effective and are not recommended (<a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/ozone-generators-are-sold-air-cleaners&amp;token=JPIXdcFLskTHpTccFXTxSLI5IYSCLx3VBKnJZ8q7AMS1qZPI1bZ+ZbWYdgdzUgEfFt5SRvCboCXajDfi4c752FOEKN0asbFeZxtPi6hStIE=&amp;TOPIC_ID=373\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA): Indoor air quality</a>).</p><p>There are several factors that interfere with how well air filters work, and these may partly explain why studies have shown mixed results:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most air filters probably can remove pollens and pet danders from the air because these allergens are light and do remain airborne. However, if there is a pet, carpeting, upholstered furniture, access to outside air, or some other reservoir of allergen in the vicinity, the allergen is continuously released from these items as people move around the house. There is far more allergen in these reservoirs than the air filter can remove. Therefore, allergens continuously enter the air, even as it is being filtered, and the benefit of an air filter is minimal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, in a room where there are no carpets, drapes, upholstered furniture, access to outside air, and pets are not allowed, running an air filter probably can improve air quality. Research is ongoing to better understand the effectiveness of air filters in helping to control asthma symptoms.</p><p/><p>In addition, a vacuum cleaner with a HEPA filtration system and a double-thickness bag can help to reduce allergen levels. This is recommended to avoid rebreathing the debris that is captured by vacuuming. A controlled trial has reported a reduction in cat and dog (but not dust mite) allergen levels and clinical improvement in asthma and allergic rhinitis symptoms in homes cleaned with vacuums equipped with HEPA filters, compared with vacuums without specialized filters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigger-avoidance-in-asthma-beyond-the-basics/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTROLLING OTHER ASTHMA TRIGGERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to indoor allergens, other factors may be identified as asthma triggers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Respiratory infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infections that cause airway inflammation can trigger asthma, including colds, influenza (flu), bronchitis, ear infections, sinus infections, and pneumonia. An asthma attack that occurs along with a respiratory infection may be more severe than one that occurs at other times. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-symptoms-and-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Influenza symptoms and treatment (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Pneumonia in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-common-cold-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: The common cold in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>To reduce the risk of a serious flare related to respiratory infection, a person with asthma should:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Call a health care provider at the first sign of an infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get a flu shot once per year.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get a pneumonia vaccine (if needed based on other risk factors).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash hands frequently, especially when in contact with an infected person, and avoid contact with infected people when possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use treatments prescribed for symptoms, such as nasal steroids and decongestants.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Medicines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sensitivity to medications can also trigger asthma. In particular, aspirin, some other anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin [brand names]) and naproxen (Aleve, Anaprox [brand names]), and certain beta-blocker heart medicines may cause an attack in certain individuals. Acetaminophen (Tylenol [brand name]) does not cause symptoms in most aspirin-sensitive patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Outdoor allergens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Asthma symptoms that worsen outdoors at certain times of the year are likely to be triggered by an allergy to pollen or mold (often present in decaying vegetation). Affected individuals should stay indoors as much as possible during the season when their asthma tends to flare, use air conditioning when possible, and keep windows closed. Exercising outdoors or participating in activities that require exertion should be avoided when levels of air pollution are high. After spending time outdoors when pollen or mold counts are high, patients can bathe and shampoo to remove residual allergens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigger-avoidance-in-asthma-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Patients should also try to avoid cutting grass, digging around plants, or participating in other outdoor activities that seem to worsen asthma symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Irritants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of irritants can trigger asthma. Irritants can be found inside or outside and include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cigarette smoke and ashes</strong> &ndash; A person with asthma should never smoke. Smoking should not be allowed in the person's home, and second-hand smoke should be avoided whenever possible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Quitting smoking (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Aerosol sprays and perfumes</strong> &ndash; Nonaerosol products should be used, and exposure to offending perfumes should be avoided.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gas stoves, fireplace smoke, and cooking odors</strong> &ndash; Wood-burning stoves, fireplaces, and pellet stoves and unvented gas stoves or heaters can worsen asthma symptoms. Cooking areas should be well-ventilated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Air pollution, car exhaust, and gas fumes</strong> &ndash; Patients should avoid unnecessary exposure to car exhaust, and outdoor exercise should be avoided when pollution levels are high. United States air quality ratings can be obtained at <a href=\"https://airnow.gov/&amp;token=NTp/1XgGXUbrqULUpyqTAcNctWd0s71cVrbRqF5603g=&amp;TOPIC_ID=373\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">airnow.gov</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Formaldehyde and volatile organic compounds</strong> &ndash; Odors from new linoleum flooring, carpeting, particleboard, wall coverings, furniture, and recent painting can worsen asthma symptoms in some people.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Chemicals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Industrial or occupational exposure to chemicals is responsible for about 15 percent of cases of asthma. If symptoms tend to flare in a workplace where chemicals are in use, the patient and health care provider can discuss strategies to limit exposure.</p><p>If possible, people whose asthma is triggered by strong odors should avoid the use of chlorine and bleach-based cleaning products. If these cleaners are needed to control the growth of mold in the home, ventilate the area thoroughly during and after use, and if possible, have a nonasthmatic person perform the cleaning. Other troubling odors include perfumes, air fresheners, scented room sprays and candles, and cooking oils.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Menstrual cycle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Between 20 and 40 percent of women with asthma report that their asthma symptoms worsen just before or during their menstrual period (called perimenstrual asthma). Women with hormonally-triggered asthma tend to have more severe asthma than women whose asthma is unaffected by hormonal changes. Perimenstrual asthma is thought to be triggered by changes in hormone levels, but exactly how it happens is unclear.</p><p>The best way to treat menstrual-associated asthma flares is not known. Some experts recommend the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use a rescue inhaler when necessary and avoid other potential asthma triggers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of a leukotriene modifier (montelukast [generic <span class=\"nowrap\">name]/Singulair</span> [brand name], zafirlukast [generic <span class=\"nowrap\">name]/Accolate</span> [brand name], or zileuton [generic <span class=\"nowrap\">name]/Zyflo</span> [brand name]) may help to prevent asthma flares related to hormonal changes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with asthma who are sensitive to anti-inflammatory medications (eg, ibuprofen [generic <span class=\"nowrap\">name]/Advil</span> and Motrin [brand names], naproxen [generic <span class=\"nowrap\">name]/Aleve</span> [brand name], aspirin [generic name]) should not take these medications for menstrual cramps.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although exercise can trigger asthma in certain people, it should <strong>not</strong> be avoided. Exercise strengthens the cardiovascular system and may decrease sensitivity to asthma triggers. To minimize the effects of this trigger, asthmatics should:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take one or two puffs from an albuterol inhaler five minutes before beginning exercise.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Start any new exercise regime slowly, gradually building strength and endurance.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Warm up gradually at the beginning of each exercise session.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take all medications on schedule.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid exercising outdoors in extremely cold weather, and cover the mouth and nose with a scarf to help warm the inspired air when temperatures are low.</p><p/><p>A detailed review of managing exercise-induced asthma is available separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-induced-asthma-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Exercise-induced asthma (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H78323995\"><span class=\"h2\">Climate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some triggers can be affected by climate changes. For instance, in areas with ozone problems, hot, sunny days can mean increased response to ozone. Caution is advised under these circumstances. In addition, patients should avoid exposure to increased mold growth from damp indoor environment, which may be aggravated by excess rain fall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigger-avoidance-in-asthma-beyond-the-basics/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26717012\"><span class=\"h2\">Food additives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sulfites are added to foods to prevent spoiling and discoloration. Foods containing sulfites (potatoes, shrimp, dried fruit, beer, wine, vinegar) may occasionally trigger asthma in sensitive individuals. If sulfite sensitivity has been identified, the patient should be sure to read food labels to make sure that sulfites are not present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your health care provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our website (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=373\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
