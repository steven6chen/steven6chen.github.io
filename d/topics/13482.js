It happens when the blood vessels that carry blood to the lungs do not widen like they should after birth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6903497\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fast breathing</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In babies with light skin, the skin or lips look blue.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In babies with dark skin, the lips look blue or darker than normal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The fluid that surrounded the baby during delivery is stained with a bowel movement (called &quot;meconium&quot;) from the baby.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6903523\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my baby need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The main test is an &quot;echocardiogram.&quot; This is an imaging test that uses sound waves to create pictures of the heart as it beats. But your baby might need other tests, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest X-ray</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood test</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrocardiogram &ndash;This test measures the electrical activity of the heart. It is also called an &quot;ECG&quot; or &quot;EKG.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6903538\"><span class=\"h1\">How is persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oxygen &ndash; Oxygen can be given different ways, including through:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A plastic hood put over the baby's head</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>2 plastic tubes put in the baby's nostrils</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A mask over the baby's mouth and nose in a treatment called &quot;continuous positive airway pressure&quot; or CPAP.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathing support &ndash; The doctor will put a tube in your baby's throat. The tube connects to a machine that helps your baby breathe. This machine is called a &quot;ventilator.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nitric oxide &ndash; This is a gas that is given through the ventilator. It helps widen the baby's blood vessels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ECMO &ndash; ECMO is a special treatment that is done only for very serious cases that do not get better with other treatments. During the treatment, the baby is connected to a machine that takes the baby's blood out little by little, adds oxygen to it, and then returns it to the baby.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6903553\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my baby's life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many babies with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn have normal lives. But babies with very serious forms of the condition or who need ECMO might have hearing problems or &quot;developmental delays.&quot; This means they take longer to do things other children the same age can do, such as walking and talking.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6903570\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-to-expect-in-the-nicu-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What to expect in the NICU (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
