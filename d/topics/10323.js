The causes of TR were not specified. Moderate or greater TR was associated with increased mortality regardless of pulmonary artery systolic pressure or left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).

Significant TR is common at the time of and following left heart valve (particularly mitral) surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-tricuspid-regurgitation/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]. Mild or moderate TR is expected to progress in approximately 25 percent of patients who have undergone left-sided valve surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-tricuspid-regurgitation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Observational studies indicate that the presence of significant pre-operative TR is a predictor of increased postoperative mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-tricuspid-regurgitation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] and development of significant TR late post-operatively is also associated with increased mortality rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-tricuspid-regurgitation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Risk factors for persistence or progression of TR include tricuspid annulus dilation (diameter on transthoracic echocardiogram &gt;40 mm or 21 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/m<sup>2</sup></span> diameter indexed to body surface area; or &gt;70 mm diameter on direct operative measurement), right ventricular <span class=\"nowrap\">dysfunction/remodeling,</span> leaflet tethering height, pulmonary artery hypertension, atrial fibrillation, nonmyxomatous etiology of MR, and a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator lead across the tricuspid annulus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-tricuspid-regurgitation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Tricuspid valve surgery at the time of left-sided valve surgery is recommended in patients at greatest risk for progressive TR (ie, those with functional TR with dilated tricuspid annulus or evidence of right heart failure), given the risk of tricuspid valve surgery at a later date. Concomitant tricuspid valve repair does not add appreciably to the risks of mitral valve surgery. Reoperation for severe TR after left-sided valve surgery is associated with a 10 to 25 percent risk of perioperative mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-tricuspid-regurgitation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>A meta-analysis included 10 studies of 2488 patients found to have mild to moderate functional TR during mitral valve operations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-tricuspid-regurgitation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The duration of postoperative follow-up ranged from 3 to over 100 months (at least 12 months in all studies except one). Patients who underwent concurrent tricuspid annuloplasty had a lower likelihood (odds ratio 0.29; 95% CI 0.19-0.44) of progressing to moderate to severe TR. However, concurrent tricuspid annuloplasty was not associated with any significant difference in mortality rate or in the need for subsequent tricuspid valve surgery. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1134995036\"><span class=\"h3\">For isolated tricuspid valve surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tricuspid valve repair or replacement is performed to control regurgitation and thus improve or prevent symptoms. Medical therapy generally has limited efficacy in reducing regurgitant flow in patients with symptomatic TR, particularly if caused by intrinsic tricuspid valve disease. Severe TR causes progressive right ventricular (RV) dilatation, which may worsen TR and lead to RV dysfunction.</p><p>Observational data suggest that tricuspid valve surgery can improve functional capacity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-tricuspid-regurgitation/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>]. As an example, among 926 consecutive patients who underwent tricuspid valve surgery (792 repairs, 134 replacements) at a single-center who were followed for a median of 4.3 years, either repair or replacement was associated with significant improvement in functional status, as measured by New York Heart Association (NYHA) class (34 percent with NYHA class 3 or 4 post-operatively, compared with 85 percent pre-operatively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-tricuspid-regurgitation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>However, scant evidence is available on the impact of tricuspid valve surgery on survival. In a propensity-score matched analysis of patients with isolated significant TR comparing 57 patients who underwent tricuspid valve surgery with 813 who did not, survival was not significantly different between the groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-tricuspid-regurgitation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H712376597\"><span class=\"h3\">At the time of pericardiectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limited evidence suggests that tricuspid valve surgery at the time of pericardiectomy may be helpful in patients with constrictive pericarditis and moderate to severe TR. TR can complicate constrictive pericarditis and is a predictor of operative risk for pericardiectomy, particularly in patients with prior radiation therapy. In a series of 261 patients undergoing surgery for constrictive pericarditis, 21 percent had moderate to severe TR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-tricuspid-regurgitation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Severity of TR decreased postoperatively in only 8 of 28 (29 percent) patients treated with pericardiectomy alone, compared with 17 of 18 (95 percent) of those undergoing concurrent tricuspid valve repair or replacement.

Advantages of tricuspid valve repair include technical ease and speed of operation.

However, patients undergoing tricuspid replacement may have greater risk factors for mortality.

Similarly, in a retrospective study of 74 rheumatic heart disease patients undergoing tricuspid valve repair at the time of mitral <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> aortic valve replacement, use of an annular ring (versus repair without a ring) was associated with decreased recurrence of TR, a higher quality of life, and improved survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-tricuspid-regurgitation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>On the other hand, some investigators have found similar rates of significant postoperative TR with ring and suture repairs. For example, in a series of 237 patients, the rate of at least moderate to severe (3+ to 4+) TR three years postoperatively was 14 percent for suture bicuspidization (plication of the posterior tricuspid leaflet) as compared with 17 percent for ring annuloplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-tricuspid-regurgitation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Since tricuspid valve tethering is a risk factor for postoperative TR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-tricuspid-regurgitation/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], additional repair techniques have been developed to reduce this risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-tricuspid-regurgitation/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Measurement of tricuspid annulus diameter and tethering distances may be helpful in choosing repair procedures with a goal of improving outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-tricuspid-regurgitation/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In a long-term (14-year) outcome study of 96 patients who underwent a complex valve repair with placement of an annuloplasty ring, 96 percent of patients had no TR at hospital discharge with a 12-year survival of 72 percent and with a rate of recurrent moderate to severe TR of 28 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-tricuspid-regurgitation/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Risk factors associated with worse postoperative TR have included worse preoperative TR, impaired left ventricular systolic function, presence of a permanent pacemaker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-tricuspid-regurgitation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], and higher pulmonary artery pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-tricuspid-regurgitation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Despite high rates of TR recurrence, reoperation after tricuspid annuloplasty is rarely performed. Hospital mortality after repeat tricuspid surgery is high (eg, 37 percent in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-tricuspid-regurgitation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Valve replacement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tricuspid valve replacement may be required if leaflet anatomy is not amenable to repair.</p><p>Operative mortality rates for tricuspid valve replacement in adults have generally been high (10 to 33 percent; 10 to 22 percent for series beginning after 1985) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-tricuspid-regurgitation/abstract/22,23,27,37,40-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23,27,37,40-43</a>]. In these series, the majority of patients had concomitant surgery on another valve <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prior valve surgery. Mid- to long-term survival following tricuspid valve replacement has been limited with five-year survival rates of 60 to 74 percent and 10-year survival rates of 37 to 58 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-tricuspid-regurgitation/abstract/27,40-42,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,40-42,44</a>]. The etiology of tricuspid valve dysfunction was not specified in most of these series.</p><p>Disparate mortality rates were observed in two studies of patients with primary (organic) tricuspid valve disease. In a series of 72 patients with primary tricuspid valve disease (largely rheumatic and congenital) undergoing valve replacement from 1979 to 2003, operative mortality was 22 percent, five-year survival was 63 percent, and 10-year survival was 55 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-tricuspid-regurgitation/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In contrast, a study of patients with primary tricuspid disease (rheumatic, congenital, endocarditis, degenerative) undergoing valve replacement from 1994 to 2007 reported a much lower operative mortality rate (1.4 percent) and high five-year survival (95 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-tricuspid-regurgitation/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Possible explanations for the lower mortality in the later study include fewer comorbidities and improved perioperative care, which included routine ultrafiltration.</p><p>The choice of bioprosthetic versus mechanical prosthetic tricuspid valve should be individualized based on patient characteristics. A mechanical valve offers greater durability but requires anticoagulation to reduce the risk of thrombosis. The 2007 ESC guidelines favor the use of large bioprostheses over mechanical valves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-tricuspid-regurgitation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, a meta-analysis of intra-institutional observational comparisons reported similar pooled survival for mechanical versus bioprosthetic valves (hazard ratio [HR] 1.07; 95% CI 0.84-1.35) and similar pooled freedom from reoperation (HR 1.24; 95% CI 0.67-2.31) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-tricuspid-regurgitation/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>The standard of care for tricuspid valve replacement is a prosthetic valve, although outcomes are suboptimal due to limited bioprosthetic valve durability and the risk of thrombosis with mechanical valves. The use of a tricuspid valve homograft as a partial or complete replacement has been reported in small series of patients (including children), but this approach is not widely available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-tricuspid-regurgitation/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H525329597\"><span class=\"h2\">Transcatheter tricuspid valve repair or replacement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies are in progress on the possibility of treating TR with transcatheter approaches similar to those used for mitral valve disease with either a clip on the valve leaflets or an annular remodeling device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-tricuspid-regurgitation/abstract/39,47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,47-49</a>].
