An &quot;evaluation&quot; is another word for a check-up or test.</p><p>Your doctor might do an evaluation if you or your family has noticed that you are having problems with your memory or thinking, or doing daily activities.</p><p>An evaluation can show:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you have memory or thinking problems &ndash; It is normal for adults to have slight memory problems as they get older. But some people have memory or thinking problems that are more serious.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The types of problems you have, and how serious they are</p><p/><p>An evaluation might also show what's causing your problems. Different conditions can cause memory and thinking problems.</p><p>Some people have only 1 evaluation. Other people have repeat evaluations to see if their problems get worse over time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14235314\"><span class=\"h1\">What does an evaluation involve?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An evaluation involves different parts. You might have all of the parts in 1 day, or it might take a few days to do all the parts. The different parts include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Talking with your doctor or nurse &ndash; Your doctor or nurse will talk with you and your family about your symptoms, behavior, and daily activities. He or she will ask about changes in your symptoms and behavior. He or she will also ask about your medical problems, medicines, and drug and alcohol use.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A physical exam</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests for your memory and thinking &ndash; The doctor or nurse will ask some questions to check your memory and thinking. For example, he or she might tell you 3 words and have you remember them for a few minutes. You might also see another person for more detailed testing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests &ndash; These tests can check for other conditions that could be causing your symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A CT or MRI scan of your brain &ndash; These are imaging tests that can create pictures of your brain. Not everyone needs a brain scan. Whether or not you have a brain scan depends on your symptoms and physical exam.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14235329\"><span class=\"h1\">Why is it important to have an evaluation?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It's important to have an evaluation because some memory and thinking problems can be treated. After treatment, the symptoms will often get better.</p><p>On the other hand, some memory or thinking problems can't be treated. Knowing this is helpful, too. For example, if you know that your problems might affect certain daily tasks or activities, then you can get help for those tasks or activities. Plus, if you know that your condition is not likely to improve, you and your family can make plans for the future.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14235344\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dementia-including-alzheimer-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dementia (including Alzheimer disease) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mild-cognitive-impairment-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Mild cognitive impairment (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=advance-directives-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Advance directives (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dementia-including-alzheimer-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Dementia (including Alzheimer disease) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
