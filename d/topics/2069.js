BHD syndrome is caused by germline mutations in the folliculin gene (<em>FLCN</em>), which encodes the protein folliculin, a putative tumor suppressor gene whose function is still under investigation.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of BHD syndrome. Renal tumors and other inherited renal cancer syndromes are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-staging-of-renal-cell-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, evaluation, and staging of renal cell carcinoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary kidney cancer syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25197018\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of BHD syndrome is unknown. Approximately 200 families have been identified worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birt-hogg-dube-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The overall penetrance of folliculin (<em>FLCN</em>) mutations in affected families is high; however, the presence of cutaneous, pulmonary, and renal manifestations varies significantly, even within families. Although the penetrance of renal cancer is relatively low, patients with BHD syndrome have a sevenfold increased risk of kidney tumors compared with the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birt-hogg-dube-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>In a review of 89 patients with BHD syndrome from 51 families from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), cutaneous lesions were found in 90 percent of patients, pulmonary cysts in 84 percent, and history of pneumothorax in 38 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birt-hogg-dube-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Renal tumors were found in 30 patients from 25 families, indicating that most families with renal tumors had only one member affected, even after screening for renal tumors all carriers of <em>FLCN</em> mutations with abdominal computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the kidneys.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25197024\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>BHD syndrome is caused by germline mutations in the folliculin (<em>FLCN</em>) gene, located on chromosome 17p11.2. These mutations are small <span class=\"nowrap\">insertion/deletions,</span> splice-site, and nonsense mutations, which lead in most cases to premature truncation and loss of function of the folliculin protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birt-hogg-dube-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. To date, 149 unique <em>FLCN </em>germline mutations spanning all 14 exons have been identified in BHD families and catalogued in the <a href=\"http://www.lovd.nl/3.0/home&amp;token=DfsmnB62fySlCfUiHFlayLZ/sbA7GuPTibUiWkBkRnPkf2gy9Fy4p+mg4x6y00NJ&amp;TOPIC_ID=100661\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Leiden Open Variation Database (LOVD, version 3.0)</a>. </p><p>Although folliculin is thought to function as a tumor suppressor, its exact mechanism of action remains unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birt-hogg-dube-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Protein-protein interaction studies led to the identification of folliculin-interacting proteins 1 and 2 (FNIP1 and FNIP2, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birt-hogg-dube-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. <em>FLCN</em> and FNIP1 interact with 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a negative regulator of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). This finding suggests that <em>FLCN</em> may act as a tumor suppressor by controlling the interactions between <span class=\"nowrap\">FNIP1/FNIP2</span> and the mTOR signaling pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birt-hogg-dube-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Studies on FNIP knockout mouse models support the hypothesis that these interacting proteins play a key role in kidney tumorigenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birt-hogg-dube-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Loss of heterozygosity has not been detected in fibrofolliculomas, which demonstrate a strong expression of <em>FLCN</em> mRNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birt-hogg-dube-syndrome/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. These findings suggest that haploinsufficiency of folliculin is sufficient to initiate the development of these skin tumors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25197030\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The phenotype of BHD syndrome is highly heterogeneous within families and between families sharing the same folliculin (<em>FLCN</em>) mutation. No clear correlations have been identified between the type of <em>FLCN</em> mutation and the extent of skin involvement and lung or kidney manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birt-hogg-dube-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Some patients may develop cutaneous lesions only; others may present with cutaneous lesions and pulmonary manifestations or cutaneous lesions and kidney tumors. In some patients, pulmonary cysts or renal tumors may be the only manifestation of the disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25197037\"><span class=\"h2\">Cutaneous lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fibrofolliculomas are typically the earliest and most frequent manifestation of BHD syndrome. They begin to appear in the third decade of life in approximately 90 percent of patients and present as round, white-gray papules 1 to 4 mm in size, some of which show a dell in the center corresponding to the follicular opening. Lesions as large as 8 mm and cystic or comedonal lesions may also occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birt-hogg-dube-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cutaneous-adnexal-tumors#H260059503\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cutaneous adnexal tumors&quot;, section on 'Follicular tumors'</a>.)</p><p>The midface (cheeks, nose) is most densely affected, and the papules are also often most prominent at this location (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F106136\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef106136 \">picture 1</a>), particularly in fair-skinned individuals with a rosaceiform complexion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F106138\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef106138 \">picture 2A</a>). Lesions may develop anywhere on the <span class=\"nowrap\">head/neck,</span> including the posterior ears (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F106139\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef106139 \">picture 3</a>). Isolated papules on the neck may be difficult to differentiate from acrochordons (skin tags) or small seborrheic keratoses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F106140\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef106140 \">picture 2B</a>).</p><p>Affected patients will continue to slowly accumulate new lesions and experience enlargement of pre-existing lesions throughout life. However, some patients have only a small number of lesions by late adulthood, whereas others may develop hundreds, at times near confluent, in the <span class=\"nowrap\">head/neck</span> area (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F106141\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef106141 \">picture 4</a>).</p><p>Other skin lesions initially described in BHD syndrome along with fibrofolliculomas include trichodiscomas and acrochordons. Trichodiscomas are clinically indistinguishable from fibrofolliculomas and may represent a histologic variant of the same tumor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F98472\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98472 \">picture 5</a>). Acrochordons (skin tags) are common in the general population, and their presence or absence is not helpful in <span class=\"nowrap\">making/excluding</span> a diagnosis of BHD syndrome. Angiofibromas may occasionally be seen in the setting of BHD syndrome but are also common in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birt-hogg-dube-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The presence of multiple facial angiofibromata should raise suspicion of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54868\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54868 \">picture 6</a>). (See <a href=\"#H25197079\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Small, mucosa-colored or whitish papules on the gingiva, tongue, mucosal lips (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F106341\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef106341 \">picture 7</a>), or buccal mucosa have been reported in some patients with BHD syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birt-hogg-dube-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, similar lesions may be seen in a variety of other hamartoma syndromes, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia I, TSC, and Cowden disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birt-hogg-dube-syndrome/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25197043\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple, bilateral pulmonary cysts develop in 70 to 80 percent of affected members of BHD families and may be the only manifestation of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birt-hogg-dube-syndrome/abstract/5,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,15</a>]. Approximately 30 percent of patients with pulmonary cysts develop single or more often multiple episodes of spontaneous pneumothorax, usually before the age of 40 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birt-hogg-dube-syndrome/abstract/3,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,16</a>]. Despite the high frequency of pulmonary involvement, most BHD patients have normal pulmonary function or mild obstructive pulmonary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birt-hogg-dube-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

In contrast with the typical apical location of air blebs seen in patients with spontaneous primary pneumothorax or pneumothorax secondary to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the majority of cysts in patients with BHD syndrome are located in the basilar medial regions of the lungs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birt-hogg-dube-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary spontaneous pneumothorax in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25197049\"><span class=\"h2\">Kidney tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Renal cancer is the most serious manifestation of BHD syndrome, occurring in approximately 12 to 34 percent of patients around the age of 50 years (range 30 to 70 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birt-hogg-dube-syndrome/abstract/3,16,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,16,18,19</a>]. In contrast with other inherited renal cancer syndromes, which are usually associated with a single histologic tumor type, BHD syndrome is associated with a wide range of tumor histologies, most commonly chromophobe tumors and hybrid <span class=\"nowrap\">chromophobe/oncocytic</span> tumors. Clear cell carcinoma, papillary carcinoma, and mixed-type carcinoma may infrequently be seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birt-hogg-dube-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Renal oncocytosis, consisting of diffuse microscopic nodules of oncocytes, which are large, well-differentiated neoplastic cells, have also been observed in kidney parenchyma in the majority of BHD patients with renal tumors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25197061\"><span class=\"h2\">Other neoplasms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although early reports suggested an association between BHD syndrome and colon polyposis and colorectal carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birt-hogg-dube-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], the analysis of a United States-based cohort including 223 members of 33 BHD families did not find an increased risk of colon polyps or colorectal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birt-hogg-dube-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, a United Kingdom study of 51 BHD families identified an elevated risk of colorectal cancer in BHD patients with a specific c.1285dupC mutation in the <em>FLCN</em> gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birt-hogg-dube-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. There are isolated reports of a variety of cutaneous and internal tumors in BHD patients, including lipomas; cutaneous cysts; melanoma; and parotid, thyroid, and parathyroid tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birt-hogg-dube-syndrome/abstract/22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25197067\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1918059267\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fibrofolliculoma, a benign hamartoma of the hair follicle, is the hallmark skin finding of BHD syndrome. Fibrofolliculoma is typically characterized by thin, epithelial strands two to four cell layers thick that emanate from an adjacent hair follicle. The epithelial strands often anastomose with one another in a background of stromal mucin and fibrocytes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F106171\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef106171 \">picture 8</a>). In trichodiscomas, the myxoid stroma is the most prominent feature, and the pilosebaceous units, if present, are at the periphery of the lesion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F98295\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98295 \">picture 9</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birt-hogg-dube-syndrome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, it is unclear whether trichodiscomas and fibrofolliculomas in fact represent discrete histopathologic entities. Features of both trichodiscoma and fibrofolliculoma, which are both derived from epithelial and mesenchymal components, can often be identified in a single biopsy. In BHD patients, histologic features of fibrofolliculoma have been demonstrated in lesions clinically resembling acrochordons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birt-hogg-dube-syndrome/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cutaneous-adnexal-tumors#H135421801\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cutaneous adnexal tumors&quot;, section on 'Trichodiscoma and fibrofolliculoma'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H324253067\"><span class=\"h2\">Lung</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The histopathologic examination of lung specimens of 11 patients with BHD syndrome and history of pulmonary cysts and recurrent pneumothorax showed that the inner surfaces of the pulmonary cysts were lined with cytokeratin-positive, type II pneumocyte-like cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birt-hogg-dube-syndrome/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. This finding suggest that, in contrast with nonspecific blebs or bullae, which result from alveolar destruction, the BHD pulmonary cysts may be considered slowly growing, hamartomatous cysts that may frequently rupture. In all cases, the epithelial cells in the pulmonary cysts stained positive for folliculin (FLCN) expression, suggesting that FLCN exists in a haploinsufficient form in cyst-lining epithelial cells.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4133882050\"><span class=\"h2\">Kidney</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>BHD syndrome is remarkable for the histologic variability of renal tumors. Chromophobe and mixed chromophobe-oncocytic patterns are most common, but papillary and clear cell histologic patterns may also be seen. Patients may have multiple tumors in the same kidney or in the contralateral kidney. In one review of 130 renal tumors from 30 patients with BHD syndrome, 50 percent were hybrid tumors with elements of oncocytoma and chromophobe renal cell carcinoma, 34 percent were chromophobe renal cell carcinoma, 9 percent clear cell renal cell carcinoma, 5 percent oncocytomas, and 2 percent papillary renal cell carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birt-hogg-dube-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Thus, the diagnosis of BHD syndrome should be suspected in any patient presenting with multiple facial papules that have been histologically proven to be fibrofolliculomas. A personal or family history of lung cysts, especially if located in the basilar medial regions of the lungs, or pneumothorax, especially if recurrent, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a family or personal history of renal cancer at a young age should raise suspicion of BHD syndrome, even in the absence of cutaneous lesions. Patients and family members with suspected BHD syndrome should undergo further clinical evaluation and imaging studies for kidney lesions and be offered genetic testing for diagnostic confirmation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605628377\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin biopsy is indicated in all patients presenting with multiple facial papules suspected to be fibrofolliculomas.
