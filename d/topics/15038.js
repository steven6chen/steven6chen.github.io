It can be acute (eg, Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome), chronic and relapsing (eg, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis), or relentlessly progressive (eg, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ALS]).</p><p>Regardless of its clinical course, respiratory muscle weakness is a serious problem among patients with neuromuscular disease. It is estimated that 15 to 28 percent of patients with myasthenia gravis and 20 to 30 percent of patients with Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome will require invasive mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-muscle-weakness-due-to-neuromuscular-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].

It can also be associated with bulbar dysfunction. Each of these abnormalities has its own related symptoms and signs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F58563\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58563 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insufficient ventilation may induce dyspnea, orthopnea, rapid shallow breathing (tachypnea plus decreased tidal volume), accessory respiratory muscle use, thoracoabdominal paradox (inward motion of the abdomen during inspiration), hypercapnia, or hypoxemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nocturnal hypoventilation may induce choking, insomnia, daytime hypersomnolence, morning headaches, fatigue, or impaired cognition.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bulbar dysfunction may induce difficulty swallowing, dysarthria, dysphagia, weak mastication, facial weakness, nasal speech, or a protruding tongue.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ineffective cough predisposes patients to aspiration, retention of secretions, or pneumonia.</p><p/><p>The pathophysiology underlying these clinical manifestations is discussed in this section.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Inadequate ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principal cause of insufficient ventilation is weakness of the inspiratory muscles (diaphragm, external intercostals, scalenes, sternocleidomastoids, and trapezii). The weak inspiratory muscles cause tidal volume to decrease. Respiratory frequency increases in an effort to compensate for the diminished tidal volume and maintain alveolar ventilation. However, the tidal volume may eventually fall to such a degree that the increased respiratory rate is insufficient to maintain alveolar ventilation and arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) begins to rise. These perturbations are responsible for dyspnea, rapid shallow breathing, and hypercapnia.</p><p>To maintain the best possible tidal volume, patients with inspiratory muscle weakness use accessory inspiratory muscles and rely on gravity to assist diaphragmatic movement. As a consequence, orthopnea, accessory respiratory muscle use, and thoracoabdominal paradox (inward motion of the abdomen during inspiration) develop.</p><p>The hypoxemia that frequently accompanies insufficient ventilation is multifactorial:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insufficient ventilation itself can cause hypoxemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxygenation-and-mechanisms-of-hypoxemia#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oxygenation and mechanisms of hypoxemia&quot;, section on 'Hypoventilation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with inspiratory muscle weakness breathe shallowly (low tidal volumes) and have an ineffective sigh, a maneuver essential for maintaining patency of alveoli. As a result, atelectasis develops and creates a physiologic right-to-left shunt. Such patients can get caught in a vicious cycle because chronic atelectasis reduces respiratory system compliance, which increases the work of breathing and predisposes the patient to worsening respiratory muscle fatigue. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxygenation-and-mechanisms-of-hypoxemia#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oxygenation and mechanisms of hypoxemia&quot;, section on 'Right-to-left shunt'</a>.)</p><p/><p>The expiratory muscles assist the inspiratory muscles when the diaphragm is weak. Active expiration forces the respiratory system to a low volume (below functional residual capacity). This moves the diaphragm to a more cephalad position, allowing the diaphragm's fibers to lengthen and more effectively generate inspiratory force. It also increases the elastic recoil energy in the chest wall, assisting the next inspiration.</p><p>Early in the course of the disease, the symptoms and signs described above may exist only when carbon dioxide production is elevated (eg, fever, infection). In such patients, ventilation may be adequate to maintain a normal PaCO<sub>2</sub> when carbon dioxide production is at its baseline, but cannot be sufficiently increased to maintain a normal PaCO<sub>2</sub> when carbon dioxide production is elevated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Nocturnal hypoventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inadequate ventilation may first manifest during sleep in patients who have chronic neuromuscular disease. This results from upper airway obstruction due to bulbar dysfunction, as well as decreased accessory respiratory muscle activity during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The symptoms and signs of nocturnal hypoventilation due to neuromuscular disease are the same as those due to obstructive sleep apnea, including choking, insomnia, daytime hypersomnolence, morning headaches, fatigue, or impaired cognition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults#H25136776\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Bulbar dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bulbar dysfunction is due to impairment of the upper airway muscles: the lips, tongue, palate, pharynx, and larynx. Symptoms and signs of bulbar dysfunction include difficulty swallowing, dysarthria, dysphagia, weak mastication, facial weakness, abnormal secretion clearance, nasal speech, or a protruding tongue. Patients with bulbar dysfunction have an increased risk of aspiration. In addition, they are predisposed to upper airway obstruction during inspiration, which may induce or exacerbate nocturnal hypoventilation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Ineffective cough</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Poor cough is caused by weakness of the upper airway, inspiratory, and expiratory muscles &ndash; internal and external obliques, rectus abdominis, transverse abdominis, and internal intercostals. Patients with a poor cough are predisposed to aspiration, pneumonia, and respiratory failure because an effective cough is a principal defense against aspiration and is necessary for clearance of respiratory secretions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-muscle-weakness-due-to-neuromuscular-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. An effective cough consists of three sequential phases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-muscle-weakness-due-to-neuromuscular-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inspiratory phase &ndash; The inspiratory phase consists of a rapid and large tidal volume inspiration. The increased lung volume lengthens the expiratory muscles allowing them to generate more positive intrathoracic pressure and greater expiratory flow during the subsequent phases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compressive phase &ndash; Glottic closure (by the upper airway adductor muscles) occurs at the onset of active expiratory muscle contraction. This results in a dramatic increase in positive intrathoracic pressure (up to 300 cm H<sub>2</sub>O).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expiratory phase &ndash; The glottis opens after approximately 0.2 seconds. This permits high peak expiratory flow (approximately 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/sec)</span> due to the sudden release of pressurized gas and dynamic airway compression. The high gas velocity in the compressed airways creates a shearing force that dislodges mucus adhering to airway walls.</p><p/><p>Inspiratory muscle weakness decreases the tidal volume inspiration, which limits the lengthening of expiratory muscles and the volume and flow of gas during the subsequent expiratory phase. Expiratory muscle weakness limits the increase in positive intrathoracic pressure, which reduces the peak expiratory flow and dynamic airway compression. Upper airway muscle weakness causes inadequate glottic closure and opening. Inadequate glottic closure results in a less effective inspiratory phase (leak of some of the inspired tidal volume) and a poor compressive phase. Inadequate glottic opening decreases the inspiratory tidal volume and expiratory flow.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with neuromuscular disease who are suspected of having respiratory muscle weakness should undergo objective physiologic testing to confirm the respiratory muscle weakness, identify patients with an ineffective cough, and identify patients who need ventilatory support.</p><p>In neuromuscular disease, the degree of respiratory muscle weakness cannot be accurately predicted by the degree of peripheral muscle weakness. Significant respiratory muscle dysfunction can exist in the presence of mild (or no) peripheral muscle weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-muscle-weakness-due-to-neuromuscular-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Therefore, tests of respiratory muscle function are essential to identify the patient who is at risk for respiratory failure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Confirm respiratory muscle weakness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Respiratory muscle weakness is confirmed by pulmonary function testing. No single abnormality is diagnostic of respiratory muscle weakness; rather, diagnosis is based on a constellation of abnormalities. The use of single tests tends to overdiagnose respiratory muscle weakness, whereas use of combinations of tests increase diagnostic accuracy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-muscle-weakness-due-to-neuromuscular-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Typical abnormalities include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pattern of restriction: reduced forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>, less than 80 percent of predicted), reduced forced vital capacity (FVC, less than 80 percent of predicted), normal FEV<sub>1</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FVC</span> ratio (greater than 70 percent of predicted), and reduced total lung capacity (TLC, less than 80 percent of predicted). Patients with predominantly expiratory muscle weakness also demonstrate an increased residual volume (RV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-muscle-weakness-due-to-neuromuscular-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pulmonary function testing in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FVC measured in the supine position is more than 10 percent lower than that measured in the upright position.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vital capacity (VC) measured in the supine position is more than 10 percent lower than that measured in the upright position.</p><p/><p>The difference between the VC and the FVC should be clearly understood. The VC is the maximum volume of gas that can be expelled from full inspiration. The FVC is also the maximum volume of gas that can be expelled from full inspiration, but it is measured when the patient is exhaling with maximal speed and effort. The VC is usually higher than the FVC, with the difference being directly related to the degree of obstruction. The VC may be a more reliable indicator of respiratory muscle weakness because it is not affected by coexisting obstructive airway disease.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV) is reduced.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) or maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) is reduced. The MIP reflects the strength of the diaphragm and other inspiratory muscles, while the MEP reflects the strength of the abdominal muscles and other expiratory muscles. Distinguishing abnormal from normal values is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tests of respiratory muscle strength&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is normal in the absence of coexisting pulmonary parenchymal or vascular involvement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diffusing-capacity-for-carbon-monoxide\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>These measures may be difficult to obtain from patients with significant bulbar dysfunction because they may have difficulty creating a seal with the mouthpiece. In such patients, the sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP) may be the best measure of respiratory muscle strength. Measuring SNIP with the contralateral nostril closed is more accurate in excluding inspiratory muscle weakness as this technique yields inspiratory pressures that are 40 percent higher than when the contralateral nostril is open [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-muscle-weakness-due-to-neuromuscular-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Approaches to respiratory muscle strength testing in patients with bulbar dysfunction and the SNIP are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tests of respiratory muscle strength&quot;, section on 'Quality assurance'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tests of respiratory muscle strength&quot;, section on 'Additional tests (invasive)'</a>.)</p><p>Regardless of the measures used, the degree of perturbation generally correlates with the severity of the respiratory muscle weakness. As an example, a MIP of -20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O indicates more severe respiratory muscle weakness than a MIP of -40 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tests of respiratory muscle strength&quot;, section on 'Severity'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tests of respiratory muscle strength&quot;, section on 'Reference range'</a>.)</p><p>Twitch occlusion pressure using magnetic stimulation of the phrenic nerve demonstrates that 17 percent of patients with neuromuscular disease do not have inspiratory muscle weakness despite an abnormal MIP and SNIP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-muscle-weakness-due-to-neuromuscular-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Another approach to assessment of inspiratory muscle function is measurement of diaphragmatic thickness by ultrasound. In a study of 42 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients, ultrasound visualized diaphragm thickness in full inspiration correlated (except in bulbar-onset patients) with a number of measures of diaphragmatic function including the MVV, FVC, SNIP, and the diaphragmatic motor response to phrenic nerve stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-muscle-weakness-due-to-neuromuscular-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Assess cough</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An ineffective cough predisposes patients to aspiration, secretion retention, pneumonia, and respiratory failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-muscle-weakness-due-to-neuromuscular-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Subjective clinical findings and objective physiologic tests are used together to determine when mechanical ventilation is indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-muscle-weakness-due-to-neuromuscular-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Patients who present with cardiorespiratory arrest, respiratory distress, marked blood gas abnormalities, severe bulbar dysfunction with aspiration, or impaired consciousness need immediate mechanical ventilation. For all other patients, mechanical ventilation should be initiated on the basis of their overall clinical status. Serial measures of pulmonary function (instead of using one measure at one point in time) can be used as rough guidelines, especially when the respiratory decline is acute:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FVC &ndash; Ventilatory support is indicated when the FVC is less than 50 percent of predicted in many patients with respiratory muscle weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-muscle-weakness-due-to-neuromuscular-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MIP and MEP &ndash; Ventilatory support is indicated when the MIP is less negative than -30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O (eg, -20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) or the MEP is below 40 cm H<sub>2</sub>O in many patients with respiratory muscle weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-muscle-weakness-due-to-neuromuscular-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].
