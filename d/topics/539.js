People with alcohol withdrawal often have a headache, a stomach ache, and trouble sleeping. But sometimes, the symptoms are much more serious and even life threatening.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24443890\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mild symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble sleeping</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trembling</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling anxious</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having an upset stomach and not wanting to eat</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sweating</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling like your heart is beating fast, beating hard, or seems to skip a beat &ndash; These heartbeat changes are called &quot;palpitations.&quot;</p><p/><p>These symptoms often start within 6 hours after a person stops drinking. They might go away within 1 or 2 days. But some people also get more serious symptoms, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizures &ndash; These are waves of abnormal electrical activity in the brain. They can make a person pass out, or move or behave strangely. With alcohol withdrawal, seizures usually happen within 12 to 48 hours after the person stops drinking.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hallucinations &ndash; Hallucinations are when you hear, see, feel, smell, or taste things that aren't there. With alcohol withdrawal, the most common type is seeing things that aren't there. This symptom tends to happen within 12 to 24 hours after the person stops drinking and stop within 1 or 2 days.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delirium tremens or DT &ndash; This is the most serious form of alcohol withdrawal. Symptoms include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hallucinations</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Feeling confused about where you are or who you are</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Feeling very upset and anxious</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Uncontrolled shaking</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A fast heartbeat</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>High blood pressure</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fever</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sweating</p><p/><p>The symptoms start 2 to 4 days after a person stops drinking and can last up to 5 days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24443905\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse right away, even if you have mild symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. The symptoms can get more serious and possibly fatal if you are not treated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24443920\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for alcohol withdrawal?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have it by learning about your symptoms and doing an exam. But he or she might do tests to check for other problems. These tests include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A CT scan of your head &ndash; A CT scan is an imaging test that can create pictures of the brain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lumbar puncture (sometimes called a &quot;spinal tap&quot;) &ndash; During this procedure, your doctor puts a thin needle into your lower back and takes out a small amount of spinal fluid. Spinal fluid is the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Your doctor will send the spinal fluid to a lab for tests.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24443935\"><span class=\"h1\">How is alcohol withdrawal treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment depends on your symptoms. If you have mild symptoms, your doctor might prescribe medicines to take at home. But to do this, you need to meet these conditions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a reliable relative or friend who can stay with you for 3 to 5 days to make sure your symptoms are not getting worse</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Be able to go in for a medical visit every day</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not be pregnant or have any physical or mental health problems</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not have other substance abuse problems, such as taking illegal drugs</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have never had serious alcohol withdrawal symptoms in the past</p><p/><p>If you do not meet these conditions or if you have serious symptoms, you will be treated in the hospital. You might get medicines through a thin tube that goes into your vein, called an &quot;IV.&quot; All people treated for alcohol withdrawal should also take multivitamins (as pills or through an IV).</p><p>Your doctor or nurse will also refer you to a program to treat people with alcohol problems. In these programs, people can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>See a counselor (such as a psychologist, social worker, or psychiatrist)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take medicines</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take part in a social support group like AA (Alcoholics Anonymous)</p><p/><p>All of these treatments can help, and you can do more than one at the same time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24443950\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=alcohol-use-when-is-drinking-a-problem-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Alcohol use &mdash; when is drinking a problem?
