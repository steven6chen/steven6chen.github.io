Pathology is the gold standard in confirming the diagnosis. If diagnostic uncertainty persists following cross-sectional imaging or in the setting of metastatic disease, fine needle biopsy guided by ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) may confirm the diagnosis. However, the diagnosis of FLC can be difficult to establish, even with an adequate core biopsy specimen, and open or wedge biopsy may be necessary to obtain adequate tissue for diagnosis.

Contrast enhancement relative to the adjacent liver parenchyma is more variable on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with hypointense signal on T1-weighted imaging in 62 percent of cases and hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging in 54 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-fibrolamellar-carcinoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

This helps in distinguishing this lesion from the hyperintense scar associated with focal nodular hyperplasia.</p><p>The utility of positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is uncertain. In contrast to primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), for which FDG-PET has limited sensitivity, case reports describe unequivocal FDG uptake in FLC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-fibrolamellar-carcinoma/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>], but uptake is variable (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F114809\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef114809 \">image 2</a>).

Pathology is the gold standard in confirming the diagnosis. If diagnostic uncertainty persists following cross-sectional imaging or in the setting of metastatic disease, fine-needle biopsy guided by ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) may confirm the diagnosis. However, the diagnosis of FLC can be difficult to establish, even with an adequate core biopsy specimen, and open or wedge biopsy may be necessary to obtain adequate tissue for diagnosis.
