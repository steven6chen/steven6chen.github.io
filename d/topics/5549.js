Consistent with impaired top-down cortical modulation, decreased response within the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and increased response within the limbic system, especially the amygdala, has been one of the most replicated findings in individuals with PTSD after exposure to traumatic script-driven imagery, as well as to masked fearful faces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissociative-aspects-of-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. </p><p>When taking a dimensional approach to individual differences in re-experiencing symptoms and associated neural response patterns in response to trauma reminders, results have shown that severity of re-experiencing at the time of traumatic memory recall was positively correlated with response in the right anterior insula, a brain region that is involved in the neural representation of somatic aspects of emotional states and interoception of feeling states.

The CEN is composed of two main nodes, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the posterior parietal cortex, and is crucial for executive functioning and working memory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissociative-aspects-of-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>]. </p><p>Research findings indicate that hyperconnectivity within the CEN may contribute to increased top-down inhibition of limbic regions associated with the dissociative subtype of PTSD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissociative-aspects-of-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. Distinct connectivity profiles have been reported among women with chronic PTSD with and without the dissociative subtype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissociative-aspects-of-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Reduced connectivity of the salience network was associated with higher severity of hyperarousal symptoms, while dissociative symptoms were associated with reduced connectivity within the DMN and between the CEN and DMN, suggesting that reduced connectivity within the DMN in individuals with dissociative PTSD may reflect disruptions in sense of self as seen in dissociative PTSD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9738003\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Particularly prominent among patients with dissociative posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are the dissociative symptoms, affective and behavioral dysregulation, and co-occurring psychiatric disorders and general medical illnesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissociative-aspects-of-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/11,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,63</a>].

Some may experience a sense of being so unreal that they feel dead. While some patients prefer to feel numb, others find this frightening. Patients describe derealization as the world appearing &ldquo;unreal,&rdquo; &ldquo;surreal,&rdquo; &ldquo;far away,&rdquo; or &ldquo;foggy.&rdquo; In addition, familiar people or places may seem unfamiliar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissociative-aspects-of-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. </p><p>Many patients with PTSD and significant dissociative symptoms report impairments in verbal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissociative-aspects-of-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>], visual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissociative-aspects-of-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>], and episodic memory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissociative-aspects-of-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>], attention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissociative-aspects-of-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>], executive functioning, and occupational and interpersonal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissociative-aspects-of-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/12,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,64</a>]. Dissociative symptoms have been implicated in impairments in social cognition, or the ability to use, store, and encode information about others through social interactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissociative-aspects-of-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. </p><p>Dissociative individuals are likely to score high on measures of hypnotizability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissociative-aspects-of-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Phenomenologically, they are able to spontaneously enter self-hypnotic states without formally inducing trance. As a result, patients with dissociative alterations in consciousness may present with or report that they have episodes of blunted affect, robotic or no movement, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> spells of &ldquo;trancing&rdquo; during which they stare or close their eyes and become unresponsive. Patients describe these episodes of dissociation as &ldquo;spacing out,&rdquo; &ldquo;trancing,&rdquo; or &ldquo;tuning out.&rdquo; </p><p>Patients with dissociative amnesia are unable to recall important autobiographical information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature. Dissociative amnesia differs from ordinary forgetfulness in that it is typically more extensive than normal forgetting <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> what is forgotten is related to stressful or traumatic events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissociative-aspects-of-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. This memory impairment appears to be due to a reversible psychological inhibition, rather than organic factors. The dissociated memories may intrude in the form of nightmares, flashbacks, avoidance behavior or conversion symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissociative-aspects-of-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Detachment from emotional and physical pain during trauma can result in alterations in memory encoding and storage. In turn, this leads to fragmentation and compartmentalization of memory and impairments in retrieving memory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissociative-aspects-of-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/11,71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,71,72</a>]. The ability to learn new information remains intact, as does general cognitive functioning. Dissociative amnesia has been documented for a variety of traumatic experiences including combat, the Nazi and Cambodian holocausts, and sexual and physical abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissociative-aspects-of-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. </p><p>Individuals with dissociative alterations in memory may report they have poor recall for much of their childhood if they experienced chronic Type II trauma in childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissociative-aspects-of-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. As an example, they may not be able to recall most childhood school teachers <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> how holidays and birthdays were celebrated within their family.

Because they vacillate between feeling too much and too little, many of these individuals attempt to manage their emotions with alcohol, illicit drugs, or overuse of prescribed drugs, or behaviors that alter their emotional state such as self-injurious behaviors (eg, cutting), binge eating, and reckless driving.
