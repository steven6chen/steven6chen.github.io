The majority of allergic reactions to stings are due to this order of insects. This topic reviews the biology and identification of the flying Hymenoptera that include bees, yellow jackets, hornets, and wasps. Avoidance of the flying Hymenoptera is discussed separately, as are fire ants, which are also members of the Hymenoptera order.

This is due partly to the repeated citation of references written by nonentomologists containing fundamental errors and partly to the extensive use of common names for these insects, such as &quot;bee,&quot; &quot;wasp,&quot; and &quot;hornet.&quot; These informal expressions are often used imprecisely by clinicians, as well as the general public. However, biologists have long adhered to a set of specific meanings for the most frequently used insect common names, as well as a standardized peer review process to create new ones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stinging-insects-biology-and-identification/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. These familiar terms, when used correctly, can facilitate communication between clinicians and their patients.</p><p>This topic review will adhere to the well-established entomologic convention that calls the aculeus (ie, a modified ovipositor used as a venom-injection device) a &quot;sting,&quot; although the colloquial term is &quot;stinger&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stinging-insects-biology-and-identification/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. No male Hymenoptera can sting because the aculeus is a female organ.</p><p>The stinging Hymenoptera are taxonomically divided into three principal groups: ants, bees, and wasps. Only bees and wasps will be discussed here.</p><p>The most important aspects of bee and wasp biology, from a clinical standpoint, involve two principal dichotomies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first major distinction is that of eusocial (highly social) versus solitary or primitively social species. Most bees and wasps are solitary, meaning that a single female builds a nest, without assistance, to rear her brood of new males and females. The purpose of her sting is for intraspecific competition over nest resources, self-defense against predators, and (in the case of solitary wasps) prey capture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stinging-insects-biology-and-identification/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. These insects will not sting to protect their nest and present no hazard to humans under most circumstances.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A relatively few bee and wasp species are eusocial. A female (termed a &quot;queen&quot;) uses her sterile daughters (termed &quot;workers&quot;) to build a nest and rear a colony of additional workers, which eventually rear a brood of new males and reproductive females. Worker bees and wasps will readily sting in defense of their nest if they perceive that it is threatened, unlike solitary or primitively social species. They will also sting in self-defense [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stinging-insects-biology-and-identification/abstract/5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The second dichotomy involves the two circumstances under which worker bees and wasps use their stings. Humans most often are stung because of accidental contact with an individual worker that is foraging for food, water, or building materials away from its nest. This lone worker delivers a single, reflexive sting in defense of its life. In contrast, disturbing a nest, or being in the vicinity of a disturbed nest, may lead to multiple stings from its alarmed workers, even if the nest itself is not directly contacted. These two sets of circumstances present completely different risk factors, requiring different types of avoidance measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stinging-insects-biology-and-identification/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">BIOLOGY AND IDENTIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For simplicity, this topic review will refer to the eusocial bees and wasps that constitute the major stinging threat to humans as &quot;social&quot; and the remaining species as &quot;solitary.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Social bees</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All social bees are classified in the family, Apidae. In general, bees are distinguished from other Hymenoptera by their collection of pollen as the protein source for their larvae. Social bees also feed their larvae honey, which they manufacture from collected floral nectar. Their nests are made of wax, which the bees secrete from glands on their abdomen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stinging-insects-biology-and-identification/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. The term &quot;hive&quot; is properly used only for manmade containers that house domesticated bees.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Bumble bees</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bumble bees are robust, easily recognized bees with a dense coat of black and yellow (or occasionally orange and white) fur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F73585\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73585 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66768\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66768 \">table 1</a>). There are 46 bumble bee species in North America north of Mexico, all of which are in the genus <em>Bombus</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stinging-insects-biology-and-identification/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Colonies last only one season, are typically rather small (usually less than 50 workers), and often located in old rodent burrows or other cavities that are not prone to human disturbance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stinging-insects-biology-and-identification/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Honey bees</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Throughout much of the world, the name &quot;honey bee&quot; refers to a single species, <em>Apis mellifera</em>. This species evolved in tropical Africa and was widely bred by humans into numerous subspecies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F62810\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62810 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66768\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66768 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stinging-insects-biology-and-identification/abstract/7,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11</a>]. Other than in its native region, all colonies living in natural circumstances are considered feral in that they have originated from domesticated lineages. Unlike bumble bees and most social wasps, honey bee colonies are able to survive temperate winters because of their stored honey and heat-producing clustering behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stinging-insects-biology-and-identification/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Members of the genus <em>Apis</em> are well known for their sting autotomy, in which the sting anchors in vertebrate flesh by means of harpoon-like barbs, is spontaneously torn from the abdomen by the bee's own escape efforts, and continues to inject venom into the victim [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stinging-insects-biology-and-identification/abstract/4,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,12,13</a>]. The bee invariably dies from its wounds.</p><p>Honey bee colonies range from 40,000 to 80,000 workers. Accidental disturbance of feral colonies in the United States was rare until the 1990s because nests were typically located within tree cavities or structural voids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stinging-insects-biology-and-identification/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. The arrival of Africanized honey bees (hybrids of various domestic honey bees with the African subspecies <em>Apis mellifera scutellata</em>) in 1990 markedly increased the stinging risk for people and domestic animals over much of the South (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F80397\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80397 \">figure 1</a>) since these bees establish nests in a wide variety of locations that are readily subject to human disturbance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stinging-insects-biology-and-identification/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. In addition, this bee has an extremely low defensive response threshold and is capable of some of the most severe attacks known for any social insect. This hyperdefensive behavior has earned them the alarmist title of &quot;killer bees&quot; by the popular media. Africanized bees are indistinguishable in appearance and venom chemistry from typical &quot;European&quot; honey bees.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Solitary bees</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several families of bees, including Apidae, contain solitary species. Most are innocuous, although a few occasionally come to the attention of clinicians either because of unusual stinging incidents or patient concerns due to their appearance.</p><p>Sweat bees are tiny bees in the family Halictidae that are attracted to human perspiration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F77442\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77442 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66768\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66768 \">table 1</a>). They often sting when accidentally pressed. These bees can be an annoying nuisance but are dangerous only to those who are allergic to their venom.</p><p>Carpenter bees (Apidae) are large bees that bore into structural wood and bear a superficial resemblance to bumble bees (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F74723\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74723 \">picture 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66768\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66768 \">table 1</a>). The territorial males may aggressively hover close to people but are completely harmless.</p><p>Mining or digger bees (Andrenidae and Apidae) may be abundant where soil conditions favor burrow construction. As with carpenter bees, most of the individuals flying back and forth in these aggregations are harmless males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stinging-insects-biology-and-identification/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Social wasps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All social wasps are classified in the family Vespidae, which also includes some solitary forms. The two medically important subfamilies are the Vespinae (commonly known in the United States as yellow jackets and hornets) and the Polistinae (commonly referred to as paper wasps). Members of both subfamilies construct distinctive nests out of wood fibers scraped from either sound (eg, fence posts) or rotted (eg, decaying logs) sources and mixed with saliva to form a paper-like material. Unlike bees, the protein source for larval growth is live arthropod prey subdued with the mandibles (not the sting). Some pestiferous yellow jacket species scavenge carrion or human food. Colonies of social wasps normally last for only one season and die out in the fall and winter in temperate regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stinging-insects-biology-and-identification/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p>One of the more enduring myths in the clinical and popular literature is that wasp stings are &quot;smooth,&quot; in contrast to the honey bee, enabling the insect to sting repeatedly. In fact, the stings of virtually all social wasps are barbed to some degree, and sting autotomy has been recorded for many more (mostly tropical) wasp species than for bees [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stinging-insects-biology-and-identification/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, most species of wasps can withdraw and reinsert their sting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Yellow jackets and hornets</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These members of the subfamily Vespinae are considered to be the most common source of stings in temperate regions due to their abundance and colony aggressiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stinging-insects-biology-and-identification/abstract/1,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,20</a>]. There are considered to be 20 species of yellow jackets and hornets in the United States and Canada, although the group's taxonomy has been historically unstable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stinging-insects-biology-and-identification/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. A few species have a unique appearance and can be readily identified (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F80397\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80397 \">figure 1</a>). The remaining species have similar patterns of bright yellow and black, and the patterns are often variable within a species. Thus, a specialist may be required to positively identify them.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genus <em>Vespa</em> &ndash; This genus comprises the true hornets, most of which are found in eastern Asia. A single, introduced species is found in the United States<em>:</em> <em>V. crabro</em>, commonly called the European hornet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F81978\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81978 \">picture 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66768\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66768 \">table 1</a>). It is a large brown and yellow wasp that typically nests in tree cavities, attics, or outbuildings. It is not a common source of stings, due to its relative scarcity, nonscavenging behavior, and high visibility (making surprise encounters unlikely) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stinging-insects-biology-and-identification/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genus <em>Dolichovespula</em> &ndash; This genus of yellow jackets is distinguished by their familiar, gray aerial nests, constructed on buildings or in vegetation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66182\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66182 \">picture 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66947\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66947 \">picture 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66768\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66768 \">table 1</a>). They are often colloquially called &quot;hornets&quot; in the United States, probably because one common, atypically large species superficially resembles the European hornet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stinging-insects-biology-and-identification/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This distinctive black and white wasp, <em>D. maculata</em>, even has the accepted common name of &quot;bald-faced hornet&quot; (sometimes incorrectly referred to as a &quot;white-faced hornet&quot;) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66754\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66754 \">picture 8</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stinging-insects-biology-and-identification/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A second abundant species, <em>D. arenaria</em>, is the size and color of most other yellow jackets and has the common name of aerial yellow jacket [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stinging-insects-biology-and-identification/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. It is also referred to as the &quot;yellow hornet,&quot; a confusing misnomer that should be discontinued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stinging-insects-biology-and-identification/abstract/2,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genus <em>Vespula</em> &ndash; This genus of yellow jackets builds nests in cavities, either subterranean or in protected structural locations, such as wall voids and attics (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F80411\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80411 \">picture 9</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66768\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66768 \">table 1</a>). One group of six species is particularly important in the United States and Canada due to their large colony size (potentially approximately 5000 living workers at colony maturity), long colony life (sometimes persisting into early winter), and propensity for scavenging a wide range of human foods. These species are <em>V. alascensis</em> (formerly misidentified as the Old World <em>V. vulgaris</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stinging-insects-biology-and-identification/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], common yellow jacket), <em>V. maculifrons</em> (Eastern yellow jacket), <em>V. pensylvanica</em> (Western yellow jacket), <em>V. squamosa</em> (Southern yellow jacket), <em>V. germanica</em> (German yellow jacket), and <em>V. flavopilosa </em>(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F62180\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62180 \">picture 10</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F80671\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80671 \">picture 11</a>). Colonies of these species typically have a single queen and last for one season only, as with all temperate social wasps. However, in areas with mild winters, including the southeastern states, California, and Hawaii, multiple queens may coexist in the same nest and produce enormous perennial colonies with a high potential for mass stinging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stinging-insects-biology-and-identification/abstract/1,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,27</a>].</p><p/><p>Clinical studies and field observations have shown that both the Eastern yellow jacket and <em>V. flavopilosa</em> often anchor their stings firmly in human skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F74030\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74030 \">picture 12</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stinging-insects-biology-and-identification/abstract/22,28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,28-30</a>]. The wasps cannot pull away from (ie, autotomize) their sting. However, the embedded sting apparatus is readily torn from the wasp's abdomen if the insect is forcibly removed by the victim. This mechanism of sting loss by traumatic evisceration is functionally similar to the true autotomy of honey bees since it is associated with the release of alarm pheromone and prolonged injection of venom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stinging-insects-biology-and-identification/abstract/22,28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,28-30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Paper wasps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Paper wasps (members of the subfamily Polistinae) are another common source of human stings in temperate areas. There are 24 species of paper wasps in the United States and Canada. Identification of these species is particularly difficult for the nonspecialist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stinging-insects-biology-and-identification/abstract/24,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,31</a>]. Paper wasps are more slender and elongated than yellow jackets (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F76529\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76529 \">figure 2</a>). They construct distinctive nests of only one comb without any protective covering (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F77793\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77793 \">picture 13</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66768\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66768 \">table 1</a>). The colonies are typically small, with no more than a few dozen workers. However, their nests can be abundant around human habitations. <em>P. dominula</em> (often incorrectly cited as <em>dominulus</em>) is especially pestiferous since it nests in both exposed and protected locations, including readily disturbed structural cavities, such as hollow fencing, light fixtures, and playground equipment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stinging-insects-biology-and-identification/abstract/24,32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,32-34</a>]. Its atypically bright yellow and black pattern and relatively small size and compact shape frequently result in it being misidentified as a yellow jacket (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F64729\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64729 \">picture 14</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Solitary wasps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several families of wasps, including Vespidae, contain solitary species.

They nest in the ground, often excavating conspicuous mounds of earth in the process. Numerous females will sometimes dig their burrows in the same vicinity, resulting in large numbers of males (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F70363\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70363 \">picture 15</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66768\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66768 \">table 1</a>) flying back and forth in the area.</p><p>Mud daubers (Crabronidae and Sphecidae) frequently build their earthen nests in protected areas on structures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F60776\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60776 \">picture 16</a>).</p><p>Velvet ants are the wingless, ant-like females of wasp species in the family Mutillidae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stinging-insects-biology-and-identification/abstract/6,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,35</a>].
