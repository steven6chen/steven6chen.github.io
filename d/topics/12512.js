It results from a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) and if untreated is characterized by intellectual disability.</p><p>An overview of PKU is presented here. A general discussion of amino acid disorders is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inborn-errors-of-metabolism-classification\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inborn errors of metabolism: Classification&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of phenylketonuria (PKU) is 1 in 13,500 to 19,000 births in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It is less common in the African-American population, with an incidence of approximately 1 in 50,000 based on newborn screening data from the state of Maryland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. PKU is rare in Finland and Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hepatic enzyme, phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), catalyzes the conversion of the essential amino acid phenylalanine to tyrosine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59603\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59603 \">figure 1</a>). Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is a cofactor required for PAH activity. This pathway accounts for most of the catabolism and is responsible for the disposal of approximately 75 percent of dietary phenylalanine, with the remainder used for protein synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Phenylketonuria (PKU), in most cases, is caused by deficiency of PAH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. This results in elevated blood and urine concentrations of phenylalanine and its metabolites, phenylacetate and phenyllactate. Tyrosine concentration is normal or low normal. Occasionally tyrosine concentrations are low. Defects in BH4 metabolism account for approximately 2 percent of patients with elevated phenylalanine levels. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiency'</a> below.)</p><p>Complete enzyme deficiency results in classic PKU, in which serum phenylalanine concentration exceeds 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span>. Residual enzyme activity causes moderate PKU (phenylalanine concentrations 900 to 1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L),</span> mild PKU (phenylalanine concentrations 600 to 900 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L),</span> mild hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA; phenylalanine concentrations 360 to 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L),</span> and benign mild HPA not requiring treatment (phenylalanine concentrations 120 to 360 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism of intellectual disability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism by which the elevated concentration of phenylalanine causes intellectual disability (mental retardation) is unknown. Excessive phenylalanine is thought to interfere with brain growth, myelination, and neurotransmitter synthesis. Potential mechanisms have been proposed based upon the following studies.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal development of neurons, glia, and extracellular matrix of the brain in postnatal rats exposed to high phenylalanine levels was suggested by changes in molecular markers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. These included increased hyaluronate-binding activity in extracellular matrix formation, alteration in the content of neural cell adhesion molecule, and increased glial fibrillary acidic protein during cerebellar development.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High phenylalanine concentrations may disrupt brain development through oxidative stress. In brains of hyperphenylalaninemic rats, total radical-trapping antioxidant potential was reduced and chemiluminescence was increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Phenylalanine inhibited both catalase and glutathione peroxidase in vivo. However, catalase was inhibited only in vitro, and superoxide dismutase was not affected in either condition.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The phenylalanine metabolites, phenylacetate and phenylpyruvate, may inhibit synthesis of alpha-tocopherolquinone, an essential cofactor for the synthesis of brain arachidonic and docosahexaenoic acid, polyunsaturated fatty acids required for normal brain development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In cultured rat hippocampal cells, phenylalanine specifically inhibited N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, thought to be involved in the regulation of memory and learning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The transport of large neutral amino acids (LNAAs) into the brain was inhibited by increased concentration of phenylalanine. Decreased LNAA is thought to inhibit synthesis of protein and neurotransmitters, resulting in deficient concentrations of dopamine and serotonin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PHENYLALANINE HYDROXYLASE DEFICIENCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most cases of phenylketonuria (PKU) are caused by phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mode of inheritance for PKU is autosomal recessive. Nearly all cases are caused by mutations in the gene encoding PAH, which has been mapped to human chromosome 12q24.1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. More than 500 mutations, including deletions, insertions, splicing defects, and missense and nonsense mutations, have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. No single mutation predominates in Caucasians, although certain mutations are more common in specific ethnic groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Most affected patients are compound heterozygotes for two different mutations.</p><p>Mutations affect the structure of PAH. PAH is a tetramer, with each monomer consisting of a catalytic and tetramerization domain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Most of the mutations that result in PKU are located in the catalytic domain. However, some occur at the interface of the two domains, where they can affect the stability of the enzyme.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of widespread neonatal screening, overt clinical manifestations of PKU are rare. Newborn infants are asymptomatic prior to the initiation of feeds containing phenylalanine (eg, breast milk or standard infant formula). If undetected by newborn screening, the onset of PKU is insidious and may not cause symptoms until early infancy.</p><p>In untreated patients, the hallmark of the disease is intellectual disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Mental impairment worsens during myelination in early childhood with increasing dietary exposure, but stabilizes when brain maturation is complete. In a series of 51 untreated patients evaluated at 28.8 to 71.8 years of age, the extent of intellectual disability was approximately evenly divided between severe (intelligence quotient [IQ] &lt;35) and mildly to moderately impaired (IQ 36 to 67) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Two had IQ &gt;68. Epilepsy occurs frequently, with 12 (23 percent) adult patients affected. Some patients had loss of motor function over time, although 41 (80 percent) had no further deterioration.</p><p>Patients treated with continuous dietary intervention after diagnosis on newborn screening may still exhibit some neurologic sequelae, although much less significant than untreated patients. One area of cognition that is particularly affected is executive (frontal lobe) function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Mild impairment in this area is seen even in patients with good dietary control of phenylalanine levels.</p><p>Other findings include abnormalities of gait, sitting posture, and stance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Bone mineral density is lower in patients with PKU, but the decrease does not appear to be clinically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Hyperactivity may occur. Light pigmentation is common, and patients may have an eczematous rash. The body and urine may have a &quot;mousy&quot; odor due to the increased concentration of the metabolite phenylacetic acid.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Brain imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>White matter injury is apparent on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the majority of patients with PKU, including those who were detected by newborn screening and received early dietary treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/20-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-25</a>]. A common finding is a symmetrical increase of T2-weighted signal in the periventricular white matter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The changes are thought to represent increased turnover of myelin caused by increased phenylalanine concentration and may be reversible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p>The severity of the abnormalities appears to be related to dietary status. This was demonstrated by a series of 34 PKU patients, aged 8 to 33 years, of whom 25 were detected by newborn screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In the early diagnosed group, the severity of MRI changes was significantly associated with serum phenylalanine concentration at the time of the study.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnosis of PKU is based upon the finding of an elevated serum concentration of phenylalanine. Blood elevations may be very high (&gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> 1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> in patients with complete deficiency of PAH.</p><p>The most useful laboratory method for newborn screening is tandem-mass spectrometry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This method also can measure additional amino acids including tyrosine and acylcarnitine ester. A high concentration of phenylalanine together with low to low-normal tyrosine concentration suggests the diagnosis of PKU. In addition, tandem-mass spectrometry can identify many other inborn errors of metabolism in a single sample. Other methods are the Guthrie bacterial inhibition assay and fluorometric analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Elevated phenylalanine levels identified through newborn screening should be confirmed with a second plasma amino acid analysis.</p><p>Enzyme analysis is not performed to confirm the diagnosis, because PAH activity is expressed only in the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Molecular analysis can be used to confirm diagnosis of PKU through identification of two pathogenic mutations in the <em>PAH </em>gene (homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations). Genetic testing can be used for carrier detection or prenatal diagnosis in families in whom the mutation(s) are known. In some cases, it may be possible to predict enzyme activity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> BH4 responsiveness from the <em>PAH</em> genotype, although the relationship may be inconsistent. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Development Conference on PKU recommended mutation analysis and genotype determination on all affected patients for initial diagnosis, genetic counseling, follow-up, and long-term prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/1,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,27</a>].</p><p>Testing for tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) defects is reviewed below. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis of BH4 deficiency'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11759633\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of patients with hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) or PKU should be provided by an experienced interdisciplinary team of nutritionists, psychologists, social workers, metabolic specialists, and pediatricians (or internists for adult patients). Ideally, adult patients should be seen in an adult clinic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Dietary restriction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mainstay of therapy in PKU is dietary restriction of phenylalanine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F102455\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102455 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/1,28-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,28-32</a>]. This requires the use of medical foods including phenylalanine-free protein substitutes (amino acid mixtures) that supply approximately 75 percent of protein requirements (except phenylalanine). Medical foods may contain glycomacropeptides (GMPs) as the protein source. GMP is a natural protein found in cheese whey that contains a small amount of phenylalanine and is supplemented with several large neutral amino acids (LNAAs). Studies have demonstrated the efficacy and palatability of a GMP diet in patients with PKU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. The table shows treatment guidelines for the United States and selected European countries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F77915\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77915 \">table 2</a>). Breastfeeding infants with PKU is encouraged under the supervision of an experienced metabolic dietitian and is alternated with phenylalanine-free formula feeding. Breast milk is usually limited to approximately 25 percent of feedings, depending upon disease severity. Phenylalanine intake through breast milk must take into account the daily phenylalanine allowance. Breast milk is lower in phenylalanine than&nbsp;standard infant formula (14 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/ounce</span> versus&nbsp;19 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/ounce,</span> respectively).&nbsp;Restriction of the maternal diet has no impact on the amino acid composition of breast milk.</p><p>The optimal intake of protein substitute needed to meet requirements, including optimal growth and development, is uncertain. Uncontrolled studies have conflicting results regarding the benefit of high versus low intake of protein substitute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/35-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-39</a>]. Two weeks of therapy with low (1.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day) and high (2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day) protein substitute intake were compared in a randomized crossover study in 25 children with well-controlled PKU whose usual median protein intake was 2.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. During low-protein substitute intake, median phenylalanine levels increased compared with the control period. During high-protein substitute intake, median phenylalanine levels were unchanged from the control period. However, there was wide variability between subjects, which appeared to be related to the carbohydrate <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fat content of the protein substitute.</p><p>The poor palatability of protein substitutes adversely affects compliance with the diet, especially in older children. The required amount of phenylalanine is provided with small amounts of natural protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Rare patients may need tyrosine supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Treatment should be initiated as soon as possible, usually before one week of age, in infants with PKU and blood phenylalanine concentration &gt;6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (360 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Treatment for elevated, but slightly lower levels of phenylalanine is controversial. We recommend treating newborns with persistent phenylalanine levels of 7 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (420 to 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span>. BH4 deficiency should be ruled out as cause of the HPA. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiency'</a> below.)</p><p>Continuation of dietary restriction throughout life appears to be necessary for optimal outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/1,13,43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13,43,44</a>]. The Agency for Health Research and Quality conducted a meta-analysis of 17 studies (including 432 individuals with PKU) that examined the relationship of blood phenylalanine to IQ. They found an increasing probability of low IQ (&lt;85) at higher blood phenylalanine levels, regardless of whether IQ was measured during childhood or beyond, with a stronger association seen between phenylalanine measured in early childhood and later IQ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Diet for life was also supported by findings in a long-term follow-up study of newborns with PKU who participated in a trial of dietary management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In the initial trial, infants were treated with a phenylalanine-restricted diet until they reached six years of age and then were randomly assigned to continue or discontinue the diet. At approximately 25 years of age, 70 of the initial 211 infants were re-evaluated. Children who continued the diet had a decreased rate of eczema (11 versus 28 percent), asthma (0 versus 12 percent), headache (0 versus 31 percent), mental disorders (22 versus 41 percent), hyperactivity (0 versus 14 percent), and hypoactivity (0 versus 19 percent), compared with those who discontinued the diet. Continuation of the diet was associated with better intellectual and achievement test scores and lower blood phenylalanine concentration. MRI abnormalities were associated with higher brain phenylalanine concentrations as assessed by magnetic resonance spectroscopy.</p><p>In nonrandomized studies, IQ scores remained stable in older children and adults with PKU who were not on a restricted diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/1,45-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,45-48</a>]. However, subtle deficits in measures of attention and speed of processing were noted when compared with baseline, continuously treated patients, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. High phenylalanine levels were shown to affect mood and sustained attention in adults in a randomized, crossover trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Nine adults were given a supplement containing phenylalanine or placebo for four weeks while on a restricted diet. Scores on the Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire filled out by both the patients and their friend or relative were significantly lower on phenylalanine supplementation compared with placebo.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Pharmacotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary pharmacotherapy available for the treatment of mild PKU is <span class=\"nowrap\">tetrahydrobiopterin/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=sapropterin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sapropterin</a>,</span> a cofactor for PAH. Pegylated phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PEG-PAL), an enzyme that degrades phenylalanine, is under investigation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9485746\"><span class=\"h4\">Tetrahydrobiopterin/sapropterin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pharmacologic doses of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) may be an alternative or adjunct to dietary restriction of phenylalanine in patients with HPA or mild to moderate PKU phenotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/50-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-53</a>]. The response to BH4 among children with PKU (but not BH4 deficiency) has been evaluated in several studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. In one of the larger studies, blood phenylalanine levels were measured in 557 newborns and children with PKU after administration of BH4 (20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> body weight) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. With responsiveness defined by a 30 percent reduction in phenylalanine level, 38 percent of patients responded when phenylalanine was measured eight hours after administration, and 46 percent responded when phenylalanine was measured 24 hours after administration. The prevalence of responsiveness was 79 to 83 percent in patients with HPA (phenylalanine &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L),</span> 49 to 60 percent in patients with mild PKU (phenylalanine 10 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> 600 to 1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L),</span> and 7 to 10 percent in patients with classic PKU (phenylalanine &gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> 1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span>. In a smaller study, responsiveness to BH4 was not consistently predicted by genotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sapropterin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Sapropterin</a>, a biologically active synthetic form of BH4, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2007 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-56</a>]. Sapropterin may be used as an adjunct to dietary restriction in patients with PKU who are responsive to BH4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/54,57-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,57-62</a>]. Patients should be offered a trial of sapropterin therapy to assess responsiveness, except those with two null mutations in trans. Sapropterin responsiveness is commonly determined by obtaining a baseline blood phenylalanine level on the day the medication is initiated and then starting the patient on a single daily dose of sapropterin at 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span>. Additional blood phenylalanine levels are then obtained at regular intervals, usually at 24 hours, one week, two weeks, and in some cases, three or four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Responsiveness to BH4 is determined using an appropriate BH4 load protocol with an observational period of at least 24 hours (48 hours is better), followed by a one- to four-week trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sapropterin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sapropterin</a> with subsequent adjustment of sapropterin dose and phenylalanine intake to optimize phenylalanine levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>In children, the suggested starting dose is 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> once daily for up to one month.

Responders whose phenylalanine levels decreased at least 15 percent were continued on sapropterin for another year, while nonresponders discontinued the medication. One month of sapropterin supplementation was associated with a significant increase in homovanillic acid, a marker of dopaminergic activity, only in nonresponders. This finding may be explained by the greater availability of sapropterin for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a BH4-dependent hydroxylase that catalyzes the synthesis of the dopamine precursor, in nonresponders. After one year of therapy, sapropterin supplementation reduced phenylalanine blood levels and increased phenylalanine dietary tolerance in a subset of patients. However, urinary monoamine metabolite levels showed an inverse relationship with phenylalanine blood levels independent of sapropterin supplementation, suggesting that long-term metabolic control is more important for monoamine metabolism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9485752\"><span class=\"h4\">Phenylalanine ammonia lyase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PAL is an enzyme derived from the prokaryote <em>Anabaena variabilis</em> (Av) that degrades phenylalanine.

The diet should be adjusted according to plasma levels.</p><p>Maternal plasma tyrosine levels should be maintained between 0.9 and 1.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. Tyrosine supplementation may be needed to maintain this range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h1\">MILD MATERNAL HYPERPHENYLALANINEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Offspring do not appear to be affected by mild maternal hyperphenylalaninemia (MHPA), a condition distinct from phenylketonuria (PKU). Blood concentrations of phenylalanine in MHPA are lower than in PKU. In an international survey that included 219 untreated pregnancies in 86 mothers with MHPA (blood phenylalanine concentration 167 to 715 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L,</span> 2.8 to 11.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL),</span> rates of spontaneous fetal loss (13 percent), congenital heart disease (2.3 percent), and severe noncardiac anomalies (2.9 percent) were similar to those expected for the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p>However, length and head circumference at birth were lower in offspring of mothers with phenylalanine concentration &gt;400 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L</span> (6.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> compared with those with lower levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-phenylketonuria/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Offspring of mothers with blood levels in the lower group had a higher median intelligence quotient (IQ) at ages 3 to 27 years (108 versus 100) than those in the higher group. However, IQ in the offspring correlated better with maternal IQ than maternal phenylalanine concentration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) catalyzes the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59603\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59603 \">figure 1</a>). Deficiency of PAH results in elevated blood and urine concentrations of phenylalanine and its metabolites, phenylacetate and phenyllactate. Tyrosine concentration is normal or nearly normal. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete enzyme deficiency results in classic phenylketonuria (PKU) (untreated serum phenylalanine concentrations of &gt;1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L</span> [20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL])</span> and elevated urine phenylketones. Residual enzyme activity causes moderate PKU (phenylalanine concentrations 900 to 1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L),</span> mild PKU (phenylalanine concentrations 600 to 900 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L),</span> mild hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA; 360 to 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L),</span> and benign mild HPA not requiring treatment (120 to 360 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span>. Approximately 2 percent of patients with HPA have defects in tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) metabolism. BH4 is a cofactor required for PAH activity. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mechanism by which the elevated concentration of phenylalanine causes intellectual disability is unknown. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of intellectual disability'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h2\">Classic PKU</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most cases of PKU are caused by PAH deficiency, which is an autosomal recessive disorder. The gene encoding PAH has been mapped to human chromosome 12q24.1. More than 400 mutations have been identified. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Newborn infants are asymptomatic before the initiation of feeds containing phenylalanine (eg, breast milk or standard infant formula). If undetected by newborn screening, PKU may not cause symptoms until early infancy. In untreated patients, the hallmark of the disease is intellectual disability. Epilepsy occurs frequently. Other findings include abnormalities of gait, sitting posture, and stance. Light pigmentation is common, and patients may have an eczematous rash. The body and urine may have a &quot;mousy&quot; odor due to the increased concentration of phenylacetic acid. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis of PKU is based upon the finding of an elevated serum concentration of phenylalanine (typically &gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L]</span> in patients with complete deficiency of PAH). Molecular analysis can be used to confirm PKU through identification of PAH mutations and for carrier detection or prenatal diagnosis in families in whom the mutation is known. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mainstay of therapy in PKU is dietary restriction of phenylalanine. This requires the use of medical foods including phenylalanine-free protein substitutes. Dietary restriction should be initiated as soon as possible in infants with PKU and blood phenylalanine concentration &gt;7 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (420 to 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span>. BH4 deficiency should be excluded before initiation of dietary restriction through analysis of dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) activity in dried blood spots and <span class=\"nowrap\">biopterin/neopterin</span> concentrations in dried urine. Continuation of dietary restriction throughout life appears to be necessary for optimal outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Dietary restriction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pharmacologic doses of BH4 may be an alternative treatment in patients with mild HPA phenotypes. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood concentrations of phenylalanine and tyrosine should be monitored frequently, especially during infancy. The intervals can be extended with increasing age. The US National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Development Conference on PKU recommended testing at weekly intervals during the first year, twice monthly from 1 to 12 years of age, and monthly after 12 years of age. (See <a href=\"#H3596819\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dietary treatment appears to reverse all signs of PKU except cognitive impairment that has already occurred. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Outcome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h2\">BH4 deficiency</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with defects in tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) metabolism typically have HPA <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> progressive neurologic deterioration during infancy due to decreased production of the neurotransmitters, dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. Untreated patients typically die before reaching one year of age. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of BH4 deficiency is confirmed by elevated concentrations of biopterin or neopterin in blood, urine, or cerebrospinal fluid, decreased DHPR activity in red blood cells, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> increased neurotransmitter metabolites in the cerebrospinal fluid. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis of BH4 deficiency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is essential that treatment for BH4 deficiency is initiated as early as possible in the disease course. BH4 deficiency is treated with a diet low in phenylalanine, supplementation with BH4, and provision of the neurotransmitter precursors L-dopa, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbidopa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbidopa</a>, and serotonin. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of BH4 deficiency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h2\">Maternal PKU</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated serum phenylalanine concentration during early pregnancy in a mother with PKU or HPA can result in phenylalanine embryopathy (irrespective of whether the fetus has PKU). The embryopathic effects include intrauterine growth restriction, intellectual disability, microcephaly, and cardiac malformations. Phenylalanine embryopathy can be prevented by dietary restriction of phenylalanine in women with PKU or HPA before and during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Phenylalanine embryopathy (maternal PKU)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35\"><span class=\"h2\">Maternal HPA</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Offspring do not appear to be affected by mild maternal hyperphenylalaninemia (MHPA), blood phenylalanine &lt;360 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L,</span> a condition distinct from PKU.
