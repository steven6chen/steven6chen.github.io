An elevated heart rate reflects, in part, activation of the sympathetic nervous system and withdrawal of parasympathetic activity, which are components of the neurohumoral response to HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-ivabradine-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. An elevated plasma norepinephrine concentration is a marker for poor survival in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-ivabradine-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. It has been unclear whether heart rate is a determinant of prognosis, or simply a marker for increased sympathetic tone. While the relative contributions of increased heart rate versus the underlying neurohumoral abnormalities are difficult to determine, the beneficial effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivabradine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ivabradine</a>, an agent that acts solely by decreasing heart rate (discussed below), suggests that an elevated heart rate, per se, contributes to adverse outcomes in patients with HFrEF. Possible detrimental effects of elevated heart rate include heart rate-related increases in myocardial oxygen consumption and shear stress and decreases in myocardial perfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-ivabradine-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

For both drugs, there is evidence that clinical benefit is related to heart rate lowering, although beta blockers likely have other beneficial effects.

In patients with HFrEF, digoxin reduces the risk of hospitalization for HF. As digoxin exerts multiple effects on cardiovascular function and neurohumoral activity, it is unclear whether the modest decrease in heart rate contributes to the overall clinical effects of the drug.
