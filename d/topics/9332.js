IPMNs have also been referred to as mucinous duct ectasias and intraductal papillary mucinous tumors. IPMNs are potentially malignant intraductal epithelial neoplasms that are grossly visible (&gt;1 cm) and are composed of mucin-producing columnar cells.

Prior to 1999, the distinction between IPMN and mucinous cystic neoplasm had not been clarified, so many lesions previously classified as MCNs may have, in fact, been IPMNs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraductal-papillary-mucinous-neoplasm-of-the-pancreas-ipmn-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Its growth pattern is villous (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F55059\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55059 \">picture 1</a>), and it expresses Mucin-2 (MUC2), MUC5, and caudal-type homeobox 2 (CDX2).

Histologically, it is composed of complex arborizing papillae. The cells resemble pancreatic and biliary duct cells. It only expresses MUC1 and MUC5. Its invasive form corresponds with a conventional ductal (tubular) adenocarcinoma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oncocytic type: Oncocytic-type IPMN is rare. It often forms large tissue nodules in the main pancreatic duct and produces little mucus. Histologically, oncocytic-type IPMN is composed of complex papillae like pancreatobiliary-type IPMN, but cytoplasm of the lining cells is eosinophilic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F53658\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53658 \">picture 2</a>).

An extrapancreatic malignancy was discovered in 34 percent of patients with IPMN compared with 12 percent of those with non-IPMN cystic neoplasms. The diagnosis of the extrapancreatic malignancy preceded the diagnosis of IPMN in 21, coincided with the diagnosis of IPMN in 51, and followed the diagnosis of IPMN in 5. The most common cancers were gastric cancer (29 patients), colorectal carcinoma (16 patients), cancer of the common bile duct (7 patients), and lymphoma (4 patients). Five patients had multiple extrapancreatic cancers. On multivariate analysis, the only predictor of an extrapancreatic malignancy was advanced age at diagnosis of the IPMN.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A similar rate of extrapancreatic malignancies was described in another series of 61 patients who underwent resection for IPMN at a single institution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraductal-papillary-mucinous-neoplasm-of-the-pancreas-ipmn-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. An extrapancreatic neoplasm was observed in 24 patients (39 percent), including 18 patients (30 percent) who had an extrapancreatic malignant neoplasm. The most common neoplasms were gastric adenocarcinoma and colorectal carcinoma. These malignancies occurred much more commonly than observed in a control group of patients with mucinous cystic neoplasm of the pancreas or pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A third series that included 390 patients with IPMN found extrapancreatic malignancies in 92 (24 percent).

(See <a href=\"#H8191539\" class=\"local\">'Progression to pancreatic cancer'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IPMNs are classified as main duct-type or branch duct-type, based upon the anatomic involvement of the pancreatic duct. Patients with involvement of both the main and branch ducts are referred to as having mixed-type IPMN, though pathologically the lesions behave like main duct IPMN. (See <a href=\"#H8191597\" class=\"local\">'Anatomic classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Histologically, IPMNs are classified as intestinal type, pancreatobiliary type, oncocytic type, and gastric type. (See <a href=\"#H8191604\" class=\"local\">'Histologic classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many patients with IPMN have no symptoms, with the neoplasm being detected incidentally when imaging studies are performed for unrelated indications. Other patients may have nonspecific symptoms. Because the main pancreatic duct may be obstructed by mucin, some patients have pancreatitis-like symptoms and elevated pancreatic enzymes. They may also develop exocrine and endocrine pancreatic insufficiency and maldigestion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of carcinoma in situ or invasive carcinoma in main duct IPMN is approximately 70 percent, whereas the majority of patients without main duct involvement have a prolonged course without the development of cancer. (See <a href=\"#H5506456\" class=\"local\">'Pancreatic malignancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cancers are typically characterized as either tubular type (morphologically indistinguishable from ductal adenocarcinoma) or colloid type (morphologically similar to cancers of other exocrine organs such as the breast and skin). Colloid carcinomas have a better prognosis than do tubular carcinomas.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with IPMN appear to be at increased risk for extrapancreatic malignancies.
