These events are most common early in life, affecting approximately 15 to 20 percent of children and 4 percent of adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-abnormal-movements-and-behaviors-during-sleep/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p>Nocturnal events are typically divided into simple behaviors (eg, single movements, repetitive or periodic movements, rhythmical movements) and complex behaviors (eg, sleep talking, sleepwalking, sleep terrors, dream enactment) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F103094\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103094 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>A detailed history, including a clear description from the patient and ideally a bed partner or family witness, is the cornerstone of establishing clues about the underlying etiology. The challenge for the clinician is to recognize when certain nocturnal events signal an underlying, treatable disorder, an emerging neurological abnormality, or a benign age-appropriate episode.</p><p>An approach to the evaluation and diagnosis of abnormal movements and behaviors during sleep is presented here. Additional topics on the diagnosis and treatment of specific parasomnias, sleep-related movement disorders, and other paroxysmal neurological events in both children and adults can be found elsewhere.

Complex behaviors can result from disruption of the control mechanisms of the three normal states of being: wake, NREM sleep, and REM sleep.</p><p>Occasionally, simple or complex motor patterns during sleep are a manifestation of seizures, dissociative psychiatric events, or even physiological states such as hypoglycemia. Therefore, clinicians should be aware that nocturnal events may be a manifestation of specific neurologic, medical, psychiatric, or sleep disorders. On the other hand, some of these behaviors, specifically the disorders of arousal and nightmares, may be normal in childhood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H531604196\"><span class=\"h2\">Simple or single movements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Simple movements during sleep are typically quick, single movements involving only one body area (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F103631\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103631 \">table 2A</a>). They tend to occur in the transition periods between sleep and wakefulness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F104210\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104210 \">figure 1</a>) and are classified by the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Third Edition (ICSD-3), as movement disorders of sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-abnormal-movements-and-behaviors-during-sleep/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypnic jerks</strong> &ndash; Hypnic jerks are a common example of simple sleep-related movements. They consist of a sudden, brief jerk of the whole body or one or more segments at sleep onset, often associated with the sense of falling. Hypnic jerks can occur at any age and are a benign phenomenon, sometimes related to sleep deprivation or excessive caffeine or other stimulant intake.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some hypnic jerks are accompanied by sensory phenomena, most commonly a kinetic sensation of falling but sometimes a brief visual, auditory, or tactile sensation. These sensory starts or sleep-related hallucinations can also occur without a motor accompaniment. Such symptoms can be distressing to patients and may lead to sleep avoidance or delayed sleep onset.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A more dramatic, primarily sensory phenomenon that also occurs at sleep onset is called exploding head syndrome, consisting of a painless sensation of head explosion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-abnormal-movements-and-behaviors-during-sleep/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. The ICSD-3 classifies this event under &quot;other parasomnias,&quot; but due to its clinical features, it is sometimes confused with a headache syndrome and even subarachnoid hemorrhage. There is typically no actual movement associated with this phenomenon.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Propriospinal myoclonus</strong> &ndash; Propriospinal myoclonus at sleep onset consists of flexion or extension jerks in the abdomen, trunk <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neck during relaxed wakefulness and drowsiness, as an individual attempts to fall asleep. Propriospinal myoclonus that persists throughout the day has been linked to spinal cord pathology in a minority of patients; however, there is no evidence that propriospinal myoclonus that is limited to sleep onset is associated with structural nervous system damage. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine is usually normal, but approximately one fifth of patients may show focal lesions of unclear significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-abnormal-movements-and-behaviors-during-sleep/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=symptomatic-secondary-myoclonus#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Symptomatic (secondary) myoclonus&quot;, section on 'Propriospinal myoclonus'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Epileptic myoclonus</strong> &ndash; Sudden jerks of the limbs that occur with waking or soon after waking in children or adolescents may represent epileptic myoclonic jerks, a type of seizure that is common in patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). These patients usually have other types of generalized seizures as well; with careful history taking, nearly all patients with JME have myoclonic seizures, but almost never in isolation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy#H88577538\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Benign sleep myoclonus</strong> <strong>of infancy </strong>&ndash; Benign sleep myoclonus of infancy, also called benign neonatal sleep myoclonus, refers to brief jerks of the limbs during NREM sleep in young infants. The jerks are usually bilateral and symmetric. They typically occur during the first few weeks of life and resolve by two to three months of age. The movements are benign but can be confused with seizures. However, unlike the jerks of myoclonic seizures or severe myoclonic epilepsy syndromes of infancy, benign myoclonus occurs exclusively during sleep, does not continue when the infant is awoken, and is associated with normal neurologic development. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonepileptic paroxysmal disorders in infancy&quot;, section on 'Benign neonatal sleep myoclonus'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bruxism</strong> &ndash; Bruxism (teeth grinding) consists of quick jerks or grinding movements involving the muscles of mastication. Bruxism typically occurs at sleep onset or in association with arousals from sleep and may recur multiple times per night. Primary consequences include dental pathology, temporomandibular joint dysfunction, and morning headaches. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleep-related-bruxism-tooth-grinding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sleep-related bruxism (tooth grinding)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polysomnography-in-the-evaluation-of-abnormal-movements-during-sleep#H428531800\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Polysomnography in the evaluation of abnormal movements during sleep&quot;, section on 'Sleep-related bruxism'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nocturnal leg cramps</strong> &ndash; Nocturnal leg cramps are painful, sustained muscle contractions, most commonly in the calf, foot, or thigh, that may occur at any time during the night. They typically last from seconds to minutes and are relieved by forceful stretching of the affected muscles. The main differentiating feature compared with other sleep-related leg movements is the presence of sustained muscle contraction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nocturnal-leg-cramps\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nocturnal leg cramps&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H531604469\"><span class=\"h2\">Periodic or rhythmic movements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Periodic or rhythmic movements that may occur in or around sleep include body or head rocking or banging, hypnagogic foot tremor, and periodic limb movements of sleep (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F103633\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103633 \">table 2B</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sleep-related rhythmic movement disorder</strong> &ndash; Rhythmic movements involving large muscle groups at sleep onset (eg, body rocking and rolling, head rocking and rolling) may occur in early childhood as the child is trying to fall asleep. In most cases, the movements are not associated with significant clinical consequences and are considered developmentally normal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When the movements or behaviors significantly interfere with normal sleep or daytime function, or result in self-harm or injury, they are classified as a sleep-related rhythmic movement disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-abnormal-movements-and-behaviors-during-sleep/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Sleep-related rhythmic movement disorder rarely occurs in adolescents and adults, sometimes in association with other sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea or restless legs <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/Willis-Ekbom</span> disease <span class=\"nowrap\">(RLS/WED),</span> in which case it may improve with treatment of the sleep disorder.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypnagogic foot tremor</strong> &ndash; Hypnagogic foot tremor is a rapid, rhythmic movement of one foot that occurs at the onset of sleep or during light NREM sleep. It is believed to be a physiologic phenomenon; in one series of 375 consecutive adults undergoing polysomnography for other reasons, hypnagogic foot tremor was noted in 8 percent of patients and was not associated with disrupted sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-abnormal-movements-and-behaviors-during-sleep/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Alternating leg muscle activation (ALMA) is a related phenomenon that consists of brief activation of the anterior tibialis in one leg in alternation with similar activity in the other leg during sleep or arousals from sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-abnormal-movements-and-behaviors-during-sleep/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Most individuals are unaware of the movements. ALMA has been identified primarily in patients with sleep-related breathing disorders and periodic limb movements. There may be an association with antidepressant use.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Periodic limb movements of sleep</strong> &ndash; Periodic limb movements of sleep are episodes of repetitive and highly stereotyped limb movements occurring every 5 to 90 seconds, primarily during the first half of the night and during NREM sleep. Most people who have periodic limb movements do not have any symptoms associated with them. They occur with increased frequency in older adults with and without other sleep or neurologic disorders. In particular, most patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">RLS/WED</span> have evidence of these movements in sleep. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults#H69787559\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder in adults&quot;, section on 'Periodic limb movements of sleep'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polysomnography-in-the-evaluation-of-abnormal-movements-during-sleep#H428531734\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Polysomnography in the evaluation of abnormal movements during sleep&quot;, section on 'Periodic limb movements of sleep'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H531604208\"><span class=\"h2\">Complex movements and behaviors (parasomnias)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complex movements and behaviors during sleep, or parasomnias, encompass common or bizarre behaviors as well as seemingly purposeful movements, perceptions, dreaming, and autonomic output during sleep or sleep transitions. While the simple movements described above tend to occur during the transition between sleep and wakefulness, more complex behaviors may occur in a variety of sleep states.</p><p>The ICSD-3 categorizes parasomnias into three major groups: events associated with NREM sleep, events associated with REM sleep, and other parasomnias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-abnormal-movements-and-behaviors-during-sleep/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H531604231\"><span class=\"h3\">During NREM sleep</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Events associated with NREM sleep include disorders of arousal (eg, sleepwalking, sleep terrors, confusional arousals) and sleep-related eating disorder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F103634\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103634 \">table 2C</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Disorders of arousal</strong> &ndash; Sleepwalking, confusional arousals, and sleep terrors are a mixture of NREM sleep and wake states, such that the features of the two states are combined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-abnormal-movements-and-behaviors-during-sleep/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These disorders represent a continuum of behaviors evoked from deep NREM sleep, possibly related to compromised ability to inhibit or fully permit arousal from sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-abnormal-movements-and-behaviors-during-sleep/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. All three are characterized by minimal cognitive functioning, amnesia for the events, and features of appearing awake, such as eyes open. Some patients report a memory of vague, visual imagery and auditory impressions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Events are often triggered by stimuli, occur after acute sleep deprivation or psychosocial stressors, and involve a variety of nonstereotyped behaviors. Sleep-disordered breathing events such as an apnea or other sleep disorders may also serve as a trigger. Disorders of arousal occur most commonly in children and adolescents. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children#H17024133\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sleepwalking and other parasomnias in children&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-of-arousal-from-non-rapid-eye-movement-sleep-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders of arousal from non-rapid eye movement sleep in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sleep-related eating disorder</strong> <strong>(SRED)</strong> &ndash; SRED is similar to other disorders of arousal and occurs due to a mixture of wake and NREM sleep. SRED is characterized by episodes of recurrent involuntary and amnestic eating during the sleep period. Patients often consume peculiar forms of food (eg, raw hamburger, cake mix) with partial or no memory of the event. In many cases, SRED may be related to treatment with a hypnotic agent or a comorbid sleep disorder such as <span class=\"nowrap\">RLS/WED</span>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-of-arousal-from-non-rapid-eye-movement-sleep-in-adults#H1725898\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders of arousal from non-rapid eye movement sleep in adults&quot;, section on 'Sleep-related eating disorder'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H531604237\"><span class=\"h3\">During REM sleep</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>REM sleep-related parasomnias include recurrent isolated sleep paralysis, nightmares, and REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F103634\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103634 \">table 2C</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Recurrent isolated sleep paralysis </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Recurrent isolated sleep paralysis is characterized by the intrusion and persistence of REM sleep-related atonia into wakefulness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-abnormal-movements-and-behaviors-during-sleep/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Patients with sleep paralysis are completely unable to move or call out, yet many will have a dramatic sense of impending doom or urgency to flee. Individuals may remember these events for years. Some of these events may also be accompanied by hallucinations. Although sleep paralysis can occur as part of the classic narcolepsy tetrad, in most cases, sleep paralysis is an isolated symptom and is related to sleep deprivation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of narcolepsy in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nightmare disorder</strong> &ndash; Complex visual imagery during REM sleep is the hallmark of nightmare disorder. Nightmares are distressing dreams that have an emotional carryover into wakefulness. While nightmares usually do not have a motor component, they may end abruptly with the patient screaming or, less frequently, experiencing a sudden jerk or brief movement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-abnormal-movements-and-behaviors-during-sleep/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. True, more complex or violent dream enactment is not consistent with nightmare disorder, but rather RBD. The latter is more common in older adults compared with children. Nightmares should also be distinguished from sleep terrors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F104443\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104443 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children#H27172810\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sleepwalking and other parasomnias in children&quot;, section on 'Sleep terrors'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nightmares-and-nightmare-disorder-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nightmares and nightmare disorder in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-of-arousal-from-non-rapid-eye-movement-sleep-in-adults#H1725886\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders of arousal from non-rapid eye movement sleep in adults&quot;, section on 'Sleep terrors'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD)</strong> &ndash; RBD is characterized by complex movements or behaviors during REM sleep that occur due to a pathologic loss of muscle paralysis (atonia) that normally occurs during REM sleep. The movements often correspond to a dream in which the individual is being attacked or needs to defend <span class=\"nowrap\">him/herself</span> or others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-abnormal-movements-and-behaviors-during-sleep/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Movements range from relatively brief limb movements to more complex, violent movements such as punching or leaping out of bed. Associated vocalization is common, and language may be laden with expletives. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-eye-movement-sleep-behavior-disorder#H1290521177\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">RBD is most commonly seen in older males in association with Parkinson disease, multiple system atrophy, and dementia with Lewy bodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-abnormal-movements-and-behaviors-during-sleep/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. The disorder may predate other symptoms of alpha-synuclein neurodegeneration by decades. In younger patients, the gender distribution is more equal, and medications are often implicated (particularly the serotonergic antidepressants). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-eye-movement-sleep-behavior-disorder#H1290521122\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H531604249\"><span class=\"h2\">Vocalization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vocalization during sleep is a common nocturnal event. Vocalization can be simple or more complex and can be associated with a variety of sleep-related movements and behaviors, both physiologic and pathologic.</p><p>Most vocalizations are utterances or short phrases, such as those seen in the normal variant of sleep talking. Talking can also be a feature of the disorders of arousals (sleepwalking, sleep terror, or confusional arousals) or RBD. The key distinction between physiologic sleep talking and disorders of arousal or REM sleep is the inclusion of other motor behaviors.</p><p>Monotonous expiratory groaning during sleep may indicate a sleep-related breathing disorder called catathrenia. Catathrenia is characterized by prolonged expirations, primarily during REM sleep, that can be very distressing to the bed partner and family members [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-abnormal-movements-and-behaviors-during-sleep/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The disorder can be treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H531604225\"><span class=\"h2\">Nocturnal epilepsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of abnormal movements or behaviors during sleep includes nocturnal seizures. While a generalized tonic clonic seizure out of sleep is usually obvious by history and not easy to confuse with a sleep disorder (bilateral tonic clonic movements, often with tongue biting <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> urinary incontinence, postictal drowsiness and confusion), some patients have focal seizures involving stereotyped, complex behaviors that occur predominantly or exclusively at night.</p><p>Behaviors associated with epileptic seizures can range across a wide spectrum and they can be difficult to distinguish from parasomnias. The main clue that events are seizures rather than parasomnias is the stereotyped nature of seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-abnormal-movements-and-behaviors-during-sleep/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, also called sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy, is one example of an epilepsy syndrome involving predominantly nocturnal seizures with complex behaviors. Onset of seizures is typically in late childhood or adolescence.

In the majority of patients, however, symptoms are not limited to the sleep period. Most patients with dissociation or panic have diurnal symptoms, a history of traumatic events, or other symptoms of major mood disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-abnormal-movements-and-behaviors-during-sleep/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Patients should be educated about triggers for events, including sleep deprivation, and counseled about ensuring a safe sleep environment. Medications that may be implicated in the behaviors (eg, serotonergic antidepressants for rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD), short-acting hypnotics for complex sleep-related behaviors) should be discontinued if possible.

If there are minor residual movements that do not impact safety, patients should be reassured and clinicians should resist the urge to over treat.</p><p>Treatment of patients with ongoing, frequent abnormal nocturnal movements or behaviors can be challenging. Clinicians may find themselves baffled as to how to proceed or what metric to use to determine success. One simple tool is the event diary. Patients or families can keep a log of the events, including the timing of the event. In this way, potential provocative factors can be examined for possible linkage. The patient or bed partner can be asked to grade the severity of the event, noting if the patient was at risk for harm, or if the event was disruptive to the family. This simple mechanism connects the patient as an active participant in the process of guiding therapy.</p><p>Some patients do not respond to therapy.
