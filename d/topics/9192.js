Offending medications include antihypertensive agents, tricyclic agents, some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, monamine oxidase inhibitors, dopamine agonists, and alpha-receptor blockers such as those that are used for the treatment of bladder outlet obstruction. If one or more of these factors is causal or contributory, then the likelihood that any pharmacologic intervention will be successful is reduced, and the situation will be confounded.</p><p>Following cessation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alfuzosin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alfuzosin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrochlorothiazide</a>, the patient's orthostatic symptoms disappeared. At a return visit two weeks later, the blood pressure is <span class=\"nowrap\">160/74</span> mmHg right arm supine and <span class=\"nowrap\">130/70</span> mmHg right arm upright. The symptoms of bladder outlet obstruction are only slightly worse. The patient now says he can live with the symptoms and agrees to ongoing follow-up with his urologist.</p><p>In this patient, the symptoms of orthostatic hypotension disappeared following cessation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alfuzosin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alfuzosin</a>, an alpha-1 selective adrenergic antagonist, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrochlorothiazide</a>. An orthostatic fall in blood pressure remains, probably due to underlying autonomic diabetic neuropathy.</p><p>What do you recommend now?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fludrocortisone</a> 0.1 mg daily and high salt intake.
