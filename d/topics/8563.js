The location of the displaced urethral meatus may range anywhere within the glans, the shaft of penis, the scrotum, or perineum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58046\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58046 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>The pathogenesis, diagnosis, and evaluation of hypospadias will be reviewed here.

The penile urethra forms as a result of remolding and fusion of the medial edges of the endodermal urethral folds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypospadias-pathogenesis-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This involves a distal canalization of the urethral plate (opening zipper) and simultaneous fusion of the proximal urethral folds (closing zipper) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F105674\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105674 \">figure 2</a>). By 12 weeks gestation, the coronal sulcus separates the glans from the shaft of the penis. By 16 to 18 weeks, urethral formation is complete, and the foreskin completely covers the glans.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In patients with hypospadias, the urethral folds fail to completely or partially close, and the foreskin does not fuse onto the ventral aspect of the penis. The extent of this fusion failure determines the position of the urethral opening. In most cases, it remains unknown what causes the arrest of normal penile development.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Penile curvature occurs normally during development and resolves by the end of urethral formation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74967\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74967 \">picture 2</a>). Penile curvature is often associated with an ectopic urethral meatus (hypospadias) but can also occur in the setting of normal glandular and penile shaft urethra, so called chordee without hypospadias.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lack of androgenic stimulation results in the female external genital phenotype, although additional data suggest that female development is not a completely passive process.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1903476744\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical correction of hypospadias requires understanding of the anatomy of both the normal and hypospadiac penis, including the innervation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypospadias-pathogenesis-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The penis in the uncircumcised male consists of the penile shaft and the distally located glans with the coronal sulcus (rim of the glans) covered by the foreskin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76391\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76391 \">figure 3</a>). The structural components include the corpus spongiosum, which contains the urethra, and the paired corpora cavernosa (erectile bodies). The corpus spongiosum lies ventral in between the two corporal bodies. The corpora cavernosa structures are covered by the thick, elastic tunica albuginea. The dorsal penile nerve lies on top of Buck's fascia, which circumferentially envelops the corpus spongiosum and cavernosa.</p><p>Sensation of the penile shaft, glans, and anterior urethra is primarily derived from the dorsal penile nerves. The neurovascular bundles lie in the 11 and 1 o'clock positions with branches extending longitudinally from 11 to 7 o'clock and 1 to 5 o'clock along the surface of the tunica albuginea, enclosing the corpora cavernosa, and terminating in the glans.

The urethral defect is typically manifested as a blind ending urethral pit (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69380\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69380 \">picture 3</a>) or a slightly ectopic urethral meatus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F107623\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef107623 \">picture 4</a>), which is usually located 1 to 2 mm from the normal terminal position of the urethral meatus on the ventral tip of the glans penis. These patients do not have any impairment of voiding or sexual function, and surgical reconstruction is rarely required.</p><p>In most patients, the foreskin is normal or only slightly deficient on the ventral aspect. However, circumcision may be difficult to perform in more severe forms of foreskin asymmetry due to the inability to properly place either a Plastibell or Gomco device over the glans and have sufficient foreskin to complete the circumcision. In these patients, circumcision, should it be desired by the family, is delayed until a freehand circumcision can be safely performed in the operating room.</p><p>A less common variation is a normally positioned urethral meatus with incomplete fusion or separation of the glans with a bridge of ventral skin. These patients may also have a dorsal hooded foreskin. However, there are no voiding issues with this variant, and reconstruction of the glans is not necessary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113916\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113916 \">picture 5</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3490737437\"><span class=\"h4\">Standard hypospadias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Standard hypospadias is characterized by an ectopic urethral meatus that is accompanied by a classic dorsal hooded foreskin without fusion of the foreskin to the scrotum, and a penis of normal length and curvature that varies from none to mild or moderate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58046\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58046 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>Standard hypospadias is further subdivided by the location of the ectopic urethral meatus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypospadias-pathogenesis-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The severity of hypospadias increases as the position of the displaced urinary meatus increases from the normal position at the tip of the glans and with increasing penile curvature.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distal &ndash; The most common location for an ectopic urethral meatus is at the proximal glans, coronal margin, or just below the coronal margin, which has been described in the literature as distal hypospadias or mild hypospadias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypospadias-pathogenesis-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Patients with distal standard hypospadias typically have a normal-size penis and glans, and dorsal hooded foreskin due to deficient ventral foreskin with or without mild penile curvature. Distal to the ectopic meatus, a pit or web of tissue is frequently present between the ectopic urethral meatus and the often distal urethral pit. Patients with this type of hypospadias may have a deflection in their urinary stream downward secondary to this web of tissue. In addition, a common parenteral observation is that the asymmetric foreskin gives the appearance that the infant is neither circumcised nor uncircumcised.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proximal &ndash; The more severe variant of standard hypospadias occurs when the urethral meatus is proximally located along the penile shaft, at the penoscrotal junction or within the scrotum. These patients often have moderate amounts of penile curvature. They have a normal size penis and glans, and a classic dorsal hooded foreskin without fusion of the foreskin to the scrotum, which distinguishes them from patients with the more severe hypospadias variant.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3242668995\"><span class=\"h4\">Severe hypospadias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe hypospadias is characterized by an ectopic urethral meatus located in the scrotum or perineum, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an abnormally small glans (&lt;14 mm at maximal diameter), and severe penile curvature, often associated with a ventral penile foreskin tethering (referred to as short urethral plate) or fusion of the foreskin to the scrotum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82087\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82087 \">picture 6</a>).

Patients with this form of hypospadias typically have an abnormally large urethral meatal opening at the coronal margin, referred to as megameatus intact prepuce (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64539\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64539 \">picture 8</a>).

However, circumcision injuries, which are infrequent, may be initially confused with hypospadias, but close examination differentiates them from hypospadias. These include meatal stenosis with ventral urethral meatal scarring, and foreskin abnormalities due to impaired circumcision (inadequate separation of the inner prepuce from the glans and inadequate skin removal).
