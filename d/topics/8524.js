When this happens, the heart can have trouble pumping blood as well as it should. This can lead to symptoms, such as trouble breathing, chest pain, and fainting. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is caused by a genetic problem that runs in families.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1731662555\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have no symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they can start during childhood, the teenage years, or adulthood.</p><p>Symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing, especially during exercise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing that gets worse when you lie down and gets better if you sit up or stand</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain, which sometimes gets worse with activity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fainting or feeling like you might faint</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling as though your heart is beating very fast or skipping beats</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling in the feet, ankles, or legs</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1731662562\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for cardiomyopathy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your doctor or nurse suspects you have cardiomyopathy, he or she will probably order an &quot;electrocardiogram&quot; (also called an &quot;ECG&quot; or &quot;EKG&quot;) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53145\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53145 \">figure 2</a>). This test measures the electrical activity in your heart. It can show if your heart beats in a normal pattern and rhythm.</p><p>Your doctor might also order an &quot;echocardiogram&quot; (or &quot;echo&quot; for short) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F77971\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77971 \">figure 3</a>). An echo uses sound waves to create an image of the heart. This test allows doctors to measure the thickness of the walls of the heart, measure the size of the spaces inside the heart &ndash; called chambers &ndash; and see how the heart pumps. Depending on your situation, you might also need other tests.</p><p>Since hypertrophic cardiomyopathy runs in families, your doctor or nurse might suggest testing your family members for the disorder, too.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1731662569\"><span class=\"h1\">What problems can hypertrophic cardiomyopathy cause?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In many cases the condition causes no problems. But in some cases it can lead to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart failure, a condition in which the heart does not pump as well as it should</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart rhythm disorders</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart block, a problem that keeps electrical signals from moving through the heart as they should</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stroke</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection of a heart valve</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sudden death</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1731662576\"><span class=\"h1\">How is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy do not need treatment. Those who do need treatment can get different kinds depending on what symptoms they have and how severe their condition is.</p><p>Treatments can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to relieve chest pain or trouble breathing</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to control the heart's rhythm</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to implant a device called an &quot;implantable cardioverter-defibrillator,&quot; or &quot;ICD.&quot; (This device keeps the heart beating normally.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery or other treatments to remove parts of the heart muscle. (This is done only when medicines do not work.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1731662583\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Talk to your doctor before you start trying to get pregnant. Most women with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are able to have normal pregnancies. But some need to change their medicines before they start trying to have a baby.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1731662590\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to protect my heart and my health?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You should be careful to always drink enough water. People with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy sometimes have problems, such as fainting, when they do not get enough fluids. On the other hand, some people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have to be careful if they have too much salt and water. Ask your doctor about how much salt is OK to have in your diet.</p><p>It&rsquo;s also important that you ask your doctor what types of physical activity are safe for you. In many cases, people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy need to avoid some kinds of activity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1731662597\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dilated-cardiomyopathy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dilated cardiomyopathy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart failure (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Atrial fibrillation (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiogram-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Echocardiogram (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-and-stress-test-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: ECG and stress test (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dilated-cardiomyopathy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Dilated cardiomyopathy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
