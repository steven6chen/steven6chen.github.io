Rupture of these vessels allows for bleeding into the space between the arachnoid membranes and dura through which the vessels traverse. Venous bleeding is usually arrested by the rising intracranial pressure or direct compression by the clot itself.</p><p>Arterial rupture can also result in SDH, and this source accounts for approximately 20 to 30 percent of SDH cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subdural-hematoma-in-adults-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. In an autopsy study of 46 patients with isolated SDH that included 23 caused by bridging vein rupture and 23 caused by arterial injury, most of the arterial SDHs were caused by injuries to small cortical arteries of &lt;1 mm diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subdural-hematoma-in-adults-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Both arterial and venous SDHs had generally similar postmortem characteristics, although SDHs caused by arterial rupture were predominately located in the temporoparietal region, while those caused by bridging vein rupture were predominately frontoparietal.</p><p>Low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure (intracranial hypotension) is another mechanism that can result in SDH. Intracranial hypotension is typically caused by a spontaneous or iatrogenic cerebrospinal fluid leak, as may occur following lumbar puncture. As the cerebrospinal fluid pressure decreases, there is a reduction in the buoyancy of the brain, causing traction on the anchoring and supporting structures. Traction on bridging veins can cause tearing and rupture of these vessels, while intracranial hypotension itself leads to engorgement of cerebral veins and subsequent leakage of fluid into the subdural space. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous intracranial hypotension: Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Key differences between SDH and epidural hematoma are readily demonstrable by unenhanced head CT or by pathologic specimens. Epidural hematoma does not cross sutural margins, but does cross dural attachments because it is located in the potential space between dura and skull. As a consequence of this, epidural hematoma characteristically has a lens-shaped appearance. SDH can cross sutural margins, but is limited by dural attachments and therefore typically appears as a crescent-shaped extra-axial lesion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Development of chronic subdural hematoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following the initial meningeal trauma and development of SDH, dural collagen synthesis is induced and fibroblasts spread over the inner surface of the dura to form a thick outer membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subdural-hematoma-in-adults-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Subsequently, a thinner inner membrane develops, resulting in complete encapsulation of the clot. This occurs over a predictable time course of approximately two weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subdural-hematoma-in-adults-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Over time, a chronic SDH may liquefy to form a hygroma, and the membranes may calcify [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subdural-hematoma-in-adults-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. More than one-half of all SDHs liquefy and tend to enlarge as opposed to remaining solid and stable in size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subdural-hematoma-in-adults-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Although the reason for this observation is unknown, a larger initial clot size appears to be related to a greater likelihood of subsequent expansion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subdural-hematoma-in-adults-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>At any time, the hematoma may expand secondary to recurrent bleeding (&quot;acute-on-chronic&quot; SDH) or from osmotic draw of water into the hygroma, owing to its high protein content. Thalamic lesions and secondary brainstem injury may develop as a consequence of the mass effect produced by a large SDH.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Subdural hygroma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to forming as the result of SDH degeneration, subdural hygromas are thought to develop passively as a consequence of traumatic brain injury followed by brain atrophy, dehydration, or decreased intracranial pressure. The mechanism of hygroma formation in this setting is related to the separation of the arachnoid layer from the dura, which can occur when a contracting brain pulls the arachnoid along with it while the dura remains adherent to the skull [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subdural-hematoma-in-adults-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Most subdural hygromas will resolve with adequate reexpansion of the intracranial contents (ie, hydration). However, some will become chronic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subdural-hematoma-in-adults-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The persistence of hygromas appears to be related to the formation of pseudomembranes (as discussed above) that line the space created between the arachnoid and the dura during the acute phase. These subsequently become vascularized by abnormally permeable capillaries that allow for further accumulation of subdural fluid.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Head trauma is the most common cause of SDH, with the majority of cases related to motor vehicle accidents, falls, and assaults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subdural-hematoma-in-adults-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H110963646\"><span class=\"h2\">Common risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with significant cerebral atrophy are at high risk for SDH. This category includes the elderly, those with a history of chronic alcohol abuse, and those with previous traumatic brain injury. In such patients, trivial head trauma or even pure whiplash injury in the absence of physical impact may produce an SDH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subdural-hematoma-in-adults-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11</a>]. Thus, SDH, particularly chronic SDH, is seen in older adults more commonly than younger adults. However, when limited to acute SDH cases caused by mild to severe head injuries, the mean age of affected patients is between 31 and 47 years old, and the majority are men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subdural-hematoma-in-adults-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10,12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12-15</a>].</p><p>While the exact incidence of SDH is unknown, acute SDH complicates approximately 11 percent of mild to severe head injuries that require hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subdural-hematoma-in-adults-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14,15</a>], and approximately 20 percent of severe traumatic brain injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subdural-hematoma-in-adults-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10,16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,16-19</a>].

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on &ldquo;patient info&rdquo; and the keyword(s) of interest.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Basics topics (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subdural-hematoma-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: Subdural hematoma (The Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subdural hematoma (SDH) is caused by bleeding in the potential space between the dura and the arachnoid membranes. Most cases of SDH result from tearing of the bridging veins that drain from the surface of the brain to the dural sinuses, but arterial rupture accounts for approximately 20 to 30 percent of cases. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Head trauma is the most common cause of SDH, with the majority of cases related to motor vehicle accidents, falls, and assaults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subdural-hematoma-in-adults-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The incidence of acute traumatic SDH is highest among middle-aged men. However, patients with significant cerebral atrophy (the elderly, those with a history of chronic alcohol abuse, and those with previous traumatic brain injury) are at high risk for SDH, and the overall incidence of SDH is highest among older adults. The use of antithrombotic agents increases the risk of SDH. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unusual causes of SDH include bleeding from a variety of sources (aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation, meningioma, dural metastases, coagulopathy) and cerebrospinal fluid hypotension. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Unusual causes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coma is present from the time of injury in approximately 50 percent of acute SDH cases. However, up to 38 percent of patients have a transient &quot;lucid interval&quot; that is followed by a progressive neurologic decline to coma. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Acute subdural hematoma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic SDH may present with the insidious onset of headaches, light-headedness, cognitive impairment, apathy, somnolence, and occasionally seizures. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Chronic subdural hematoma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to SDH, head trauma is a major cause of epidural hematoma (EDH), subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebral contusion, diffuse brain swelling, and fractures. Any of these injuries may coexist in a given patient following trauma, and their clinical manifestations can be difficult to distinguish. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Computed tomography (CT) of the head is the most widely used imaging study for acute head trauma owing to its speed, accuracy, and widespread availability. Acute SDH is visualized on CT as a high-density crescentic collection across the hemispheric convexity. However, brain MRI is more sensitive than CT for the detection of SDH, particularly for hematomas that are small, or those located adjacent to the tentorium cerebelli or interhemispheric fissure.
