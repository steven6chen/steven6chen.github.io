These include hernia formation, leaks (including hydrothorax or pleuroperitoneal leaks), local edema, back pain, and gastrointestinal problems, such as gastroesophageal reflux and delayed gastric emptying (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-hernias-in-continuous-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal hernias in continuous peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninfectious-complications-of-peritoneal-dialysis-catheters\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninfectious complications of peritoneal dialysis catheters&quot;</a>).

Medical management of both GERD and gastroparesis is similar to that in patients not on dialysis.

Diaphragmatic hernias, for example, may allow dissection of fluid through defects around the major vessels and the esophagus or through diaphragmatic foramina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninfectious-complications-of-continuous-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. In addition, the negative intrathoracic pressure, combined with an increased intra-abdominal pressure caused by dialysate instillation, may open small defects in the diaphragm and promote the flow of dialysate into the pleural space. In autopsy studies, discontinuities in the tendinous portions of the hemidiaphragms have been observed, thereby supporting the presence of diaphragmatic defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninfectious-complications-of-continuous-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Acquired diaphragmatic defects may also permit the development of hydrothorax.

Because of the significantly reduced abdominal capacity of these patients, a marked increase in hydrostatic pressure occurs after the infusion of dialysate, thereby favoring the flow of dialysate from the peritoneum to the chest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninfectious-complications-of-continuous-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/20,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical characteristics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Presenting symptoms and signs of pleural effusion include dyspnea and inadequate ultrafiltration ability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninfectious-complications-of-continuous-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

A detailed discussion of the diagnosis and evaluation of this problem is presented separately.

Acute thoracentesis to remove large pleural effusions is rarely required. In most cases, simply draining the peritoneal cavity and avoiding overnight (supine) dwells is sufficient.

However, an inverse relationship between concentrations of magnesium and intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) raises the possibility that hypermagnesemia suppresses PTH levels, thereby contributing to adynamic bone disease in peritoneal dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninfectious-complications-of-continuous-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. As a result, although abnormalities in calcium, vitamin D, and phosphorus metabolism are the primary factors, more attention should be focused upon the role of magnesium in leading to the relative high incidence of adynamic bone disease in peritoneal dialysis patients (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD)&quot;</a>). In addition, multiple factors can affect plasma magnesium concentration including diet, nutritional status, albumin levels, medications like proton pump inhibitors, and dialysis prescriptions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninfectious-complications-of-continuous-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Little is known about hypo- and hypermagnesemia among dialysis patients, especially on cardiovascular status and mortality, and more study of this cation in relation to dialysis is needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninfectious-complications-of-continuous-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>].</p><p>Current <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peritoneal-dialysis-solutions-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">peritoneal dialysis solutions</a> contain magnesium concentrations of 0.75, 0.5, and 0.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> (1.8, 1.2, and 0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span>.

A single-center, retrospective study of 253 incident peritoneal dialysis patients found that 14.2 percent were hypomagnesemic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninfectious-complications-of-continuous-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Peritoneal dialysis duration and hypoalbuminemia were associated with low magnesium levels in these patients who also had a higher mortality and cardiovascular mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninfectious-complications-of-continuous-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. A large cohort study of 10,692 incident peritoneal dialysis patients beginning peritoneal dialysis between January 2007 and December 2011 found that 18 percent of patients had a serum magnesium level &lt;1.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> 21 percent had a magnesium level of 1.8 to 2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> and only 19 percent had a level &ge;2.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninfectious-complications-of-continuous-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Patients with magnesium level &lt;1.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> had a higher risk of hospitalization (HR 1.23) and a higher risk of death (HR 1.21).

These include gastroesophageal reflux and delayed gastric emptying, back and abdominal pain, and pleural effusion. Additional common issues observed in peritoneal dialysis patients include hemoperitoneum, hypokalemia, and dysmagnesemia. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastroesophageal reflux and delayed gastric emptying should be considered in well-dialyzed patients complaining of nausea, vomiting, fullness, and epigastric discomfort. In addition to general measures, the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux in <span class=\"nowrap\">CAPD/CCPD</span> patients may involve minimizing the supine intraperitoneal fluid volume. However, since achieving adequate dialysis in <span class=\"nowrap\">CAPD/CCPD</span> patients depends in large part on the exchange volume, this strategy may require careful tailoring of the dialysis prescription to avoid inadequate small-solute clearance, especially since there is no clear association of increased intra-abdominal pressure with the occurrence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in small studies of peritoneal dialysis patients. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Gastroesophageal reflux disease and delayed gastric emptying'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pleuroperitoneal leak should be considered in peritoneal dialysis patients with pleural effusion (especially right-sided effusion) without other signs of heart failure. A number of different measures can be utilized based upon severity and underlying cause. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Pleural effusion due to pleuroperitoneal leak'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal pain in a peritoneal dialysis patient should prompt consideration of peritonitis, catheter malfunction, or possibly infusion pain from high dextrose or acidic dialysate. Infusion pain may be treated with intraperitoneal infusion of bicarbonate. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Pain on dialysate infusion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unlike hemodialysis patients, hypokalemia is fairly common in peritoneal dialysis patients and is likely associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in a U-shaped manner. Liberalization of dietary potassium and, often, oral potassium supplementation or aldosterone may be needed. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Electrolyte abnormalities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypomagnesemia is observed in a significant percentage of peritoneal dialysis patients and may be associated with hospitalization and mortality.
