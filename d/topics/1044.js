The mean absorption half-life is four hours with a lag time of slightly more than 30 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The terminal half-life for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloroquine</a> and HCQ is one to two months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The (S) enantiomer of HCQ (50 percent of the commercial product) has greater bioavailability but a shorter half-life than the (R) enantiomer and holds promise for formulation as a more potent product with less eye toxicity potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>Tissue distribution is wide with accumulation in muscle, liver, spleen, kidney, lung, blood elements, adrenal and pituitary glands, and melanin-containing tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Chloroquine</a> binds to corneal tissue more avidly than HCQ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Steady state antimalarial blood concentrations vary greatly; 94 percent equilibrium is achieved by quinacrine in four weeks compared with 96 percent by HCQ in six months. The major metabolite of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloroquine</a>, desethylchloroquine, can reach blood levels nearly one-half those of the parent compound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Because of the considerable time required to reach equilibrium, higher (loading) doses have been assessed in patients with RA. Although higher daily doses (up to 1200 mg per day for six weeks) are associated with higher blood concentrations of HCQ and its metabolites and with more rapid onset of beneficial clinical effects, such high-dose regimens are also associated with more frequent adverse gastrointestinal side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal clearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excretion of these drugs is principally by direct renal clearance of the parent compound and hepatic metabolites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/2,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,10</a>]. Thus, the drug dose should be reduced in patients with renal insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. We typically reduce the dose of HCQ to 200 mg daily in patients with end-stage renal disease. Both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloroquine</a> and HCQ can cause a 10 percent decrease in creatinine clearance by competitively inhibiting creatinine secretion; this does not represent a true change in renal function. Antimalarials have been found in the urine five years after medication was stopped [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Interactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Chloroquine</a> decreases the bioavailability of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

In addition, cigarette smoking can increase the metabolism of antimalarial agents, thereby decreasing their efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Preparations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HCQ is available as a 200 mg tablet. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Chloroquine</a> comes as a 500 mg tablet, which can be cut in half, or as a 250 mg tablet. Quinacrine is not being manufactured by a pharmaceutical company; it must be formulated by a compounding pharmacist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF ACTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antimalarials have a wide variety of actions, a number of which may be responsible for their immunomodulatory effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. The most important mechanisms of action that affect the inflammatory diseases include their effects on the innate immune system and their lysosomotropic actions. Potential mechanisms of action include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One of the most important actions deals with its actions related to toll-like receptors (TLRs). Cytosine phosphate diester-guanine (CpG) DNA stimulates cells through TLR-9, which is found in lysosomes. Chloroquines may block costimulation of the B cell antigen receptor and TLR-9 pathways and, thus, may act as an antiinflammatory agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Furthermore, antimalarials can inhibit activation of intracellular TLR-3 and TLR-7 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Finally, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a> (HCQ) appears to exert an inhibitor effect on toll-like receptor signaling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Nucleic acid-sensing TLRs are located intracellularly and are activated by foreign nucleic acids that are presented to them by intermediate molecules, such as Fc-gamma receptors. TLRs are processed by endosomes before becoming active; thus, antimalarial inhibition of endosomal activation inhibits TLR activation. In addition, the binding of nucleic acids to TLR through nucleic acid-binding epitopes is also mechanically inhibited by antimalarial binding that masks these epitopes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another important mechanism appears to be interference with normal physiologic function of subcellular compartments that depend upon an acidic milieu. This effect is termed a &quot;lysosomotropic action,&quot; because it was first demonstrated in lysosomes. Antimalarials are weak bases that enter not just lysosomes but all acidic compartments in which they are protonated, that raise the pH, and that interfere with functions dependent upon an acidic pH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Antimalarials antagonize immune stimulation by CpG-DNA (a ligand for TLR-9), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloroquine</a> inhibits immune stimulation by small nuclear RNA (a ligand for TLR-7) and subsequent production of interferon alpha. TLRs require an acidic pH; thus, an increase in lysosomal pH caused by antimalarials may prevent functional transformation of intracellular TLRs and may inhibit their activation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This mode of action has many secondary effects. It interferes with receptor recycling, intracellular processing, and the secretion of proteins, which leads to a decreased production of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/11,24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,24-26</a>]. Immune effects include decreased lymphocyte proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], interference with natural killer cell activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], and, possibly, alteration of autoantibody production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In addition, antimalarials may influence the binding of autoantigenic peptides to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, thereby interfering with antigen processing and ultimately with the immune response to autoantigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It has also been suggested that decreased secretion of monocyte-derived proinflammatory cytokines may be due to non-lysosomotropic effects of antimalarials. These include a decrease in secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha by stimulated human peripheral blood derived mononuclear cells in response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloroquine</a>, which was associated with decreased amounts of TNF-messenger RNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other actions may play a role in the antirheumatic activity of antimalarials. Antiinflammatory effects may include inhibiting phospholipases, antagonizing prostaglandin, stabilizing lysosomal membranes, decreasing fibronectin release by macrophages, blocking superoxide release, and decreasing metalloproteinase production by synoviocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/28,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,30,31</a>]. These drugs also block ultraviolet light absorption, an effect that may protect against lupus skin lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antimalarial agents favorably affect serum lipid concentrations, probably due to effects upon receptor recycling. As an example, when fasting lipid profiles were assessed in 123 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (nearly one-half of whom were taking antimalarials), the mean serum concentrations of total, low density, and very low density cholesterol were significantly lower in those taking antimalarials (12, 16, and 22 percent less than patients not taking these agents, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. High density cholesterol levels are unaffected by antimalarial use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HCQ is also a mild anticoagulant. It inhibits platelet aggregation and adhesion without altering the bleeding time, and its use is not associated with increased bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. It may decrease the risk of thrombotic events in patients with SLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>], which may be mediated through protecting the annexin A5 anticoagulant shield [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. It also has a weak inhibitory effect on acetylcholinesterase; a resulting increase in synaptic transmission at neuroglandular sites may contribute to stimulation of salivary flow in Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some evidence also suggests that HCQ has a favorable effect on bone mineral density [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">ADVERSE EFFECTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antimalarials are among the safest antirheumatic medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Serious side effects are extremely rare. The most common adverse reactions are related to the gastrointestinal tract, skin, and central nervous system (CNS). The fear of ophthalmologic problems remains prominent, although this is not a major concern when using the relatively low daily doses that are usual in rheumatologic practice, if appropriate monitoring is performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastrointestinal problems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastrointestinal upset is the most common side effect necessitating discontinuation of antimalarials. It is more common with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloroquine</a> than with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a> (HCQ), even at doses of relatively equal efficacy (eg, 250 mg and 400 mg, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Nausea is most common; it may be so severe that the patient does not wish to eat. Vomiting and diarrhea may also occur.</p><p>The gastrointestinal side effects are, in part, related to muscular effects that cause abdominal cramps. The antimalarials do not cause ulcer formation or life-threatening gastrointestinal complications. It may be possible to lessen these problems by taking the medication at bedtime. Alternatively, decreasing the dose to one half-pill daily or every other day, and then gradually increasing the dose every one to two weeks as tolerated, may result in improved patient tolerance. Hepatotoxicity due to antimalarial agents is generally uncommon.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A dermatologic reaction occurs in about 10 percent of patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloroquine</a> or HCQ. The lesions may be of almost any type and are allergic in nature. They most frequently appear as pruritic maculopapular lesions. It may be feasible to reintroduce antimalarial therapy to patients with allergic skin reactions using a slow oral desensitization regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Patients receiving long-term therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloroquine</a> or HCQ may develop hyperpigmentation, often on the shins. They can also develop hyper- or hypopigmentation of the hair and oral mucosa. Studies have found that the development of pigmented lesions was more frequent in patients with conditions associated with easy bruising (eg, use of anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents) and usually preceded by local ecchymotic changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. As noted above, quinacrine causes a reversible yellowing of the skin in most patients. In addition, some patients develop black and blue marks on the palate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>There have been conflicting reports regarding the safety of HCQ among patients with psoriatic skin lesions. While some case reports have suggested HCQ is associated with exacerbations of psoriatic skin lesions, subsequent reports have found HCQ to be well-tolerated in patients with psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">CNS involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Central nervous system side effects are usually not severe. Headaches are most common, followed by lightheadedness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Both of these effects may disappear spontaneously within several weeks, although a temporary daily dose reduction may be needed.</p><p>Other problems include tinnitus, insomnia, and increased nervousness. Rare complications include psychosis and convulsions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/11,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuromuscular and cardiac toxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antimalarial drugs used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported to cause a toxic neuropathy, drug-induced skeletal myopathy, cardiomyopathy, and rarely, cardiac arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/51-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-56</a>]. Most of the case reports have involved <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloroquine</a>, but HCQ has been rarely implicated. Myopathy is a rare complication of these drugs; one study estimated the incidence to be 1 in 100 patient-years, although this has not been confirmed by others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].

Corneal deposits are rare with HCQ at a dose of 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. The deposits do not affect vision but can create transient halos or heightened light sensitivity, and they are reversible upon discontinuation of the medication.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Retinopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retinopathy is the most important ophthalmologic complication of antimalarial therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. The exact mechanism in which HCQ and CQ can lead to retinopathy is not entirely clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. It had been hypothesized that antimalarials bind to melanin in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), an effect that may damage the overlying photoreceptors and may lead to permanent vision loss. It is still a matter of debate as to whether the primary effect of the antimalarials occurs at the level of the RPE or the photoreceptors.</p><p>Estimates of risk depend upon the sensitivity of the screening method, and risk increases with higher doses and a greater duration of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A registry-based study of 3995 patients with rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus who used <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a> found that the risk of toxicity was low in the first five to seven years of exposure (0.29 to 0.33 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. The point estimates of risk rose steadily thereafter; risks at 10, 15, and 20 years were 1, 2.1, and 3.1 percent, respectively. Similarly, risk was significantly greater for patients treated with a cumulative dose of greater than 1000 mg of HCQ, compared with those treated with less (odds ratio 4.5, 95% CI 1.4-14.5).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 2361 patients using HCQ continuously for at least five years, the overall prevalence of HCQ retinopathy, using sensitive techniques (central visual field examination or spectral domain optical coherence imaging), was 7.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Dose calculation by real body weight was a better predictor of risk than ideal body weight; 5.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> real body weight corresponds to approximately 6.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of ideal body weight. In patients treated with 4.0 to 5.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> based upon real body weight, the prevalence of retinal toxicity was less than 2 percent during the first 10 years of therapy, but the risk increased to nearly 20 percent after 20 years of use. The annual risk subsequent to an examination showing no evidence of toxicity in patients using no more than 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> was less than 1 percent during the first 10 years of use, but rose to almost 4 percent per year after 20 years.

These &quot;premaculopathy&quot; changes consist of macular edema, increased pigmentation, increased granularity, and loss of the foveal reflex.

Detection of changes at this stage, using techniques such as spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and multifocal electroretinography, is desirable since such changes are likely to stabilize without loss of visual acuity, and in some cases retinopathy may be completely reversible upon discontinuation of the medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>]. With the advanced electrophysiological screening methods, up to 7 percent of patients taking HCQ have retinal changes after five years of use. These are rarely symptomatic, but may require alterations in the dosing regimen and drug discontinuation.</p><p>More advanced macular disease, a true retinopathy, is characterized by a central patchy area of depigmentation of the macula surrounded by a concentric ring of pigmentation, a &quot;bull's eye&quot; lesion.

The baseline examination should include a fundus evaluation of the macula to rule out any underlying disease that might interfere with the interpretation of screening tests. If normal, the frequency of follow-up examinations range from annually, or may be deferred until there have been five years of exposure, depending upon the presence of major risk factors for toxic retinopathy. Major risk factors include a daily dose of HCQ greater than 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> real body weight or a daily dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloroquine</a> greater than 2.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> real body weight, antimalarial use for greater than five years, the presence of renal disease, concomitant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> use, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the presence of macular disease. Antimalarial dosing should be based on real body weight, with a maximum daily dose of &le;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> for HCQ and &le;2.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> for chloroquine. After five years of therapy, all patients should be screened at least annually. Retinal changes with HCQ use may be rapidly reversible in patients with very early changes, but significant clinical recovery is not generally seen once bilateral paracentral scotomas or visible bull's eye maculopathy is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Thus, the drug should be discontinued if there is any suspicion of retinopathy.</p><p>Previous recommendations for monitoring ocular health in patients receiving HCQ and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloroquine</a> included a higher maximum daily dose of less than 6.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> for HCQ and 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IBW for chloroquine, as well as an adjustment for ideal body weight in shorter individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. The lower maximum dose limits for HCQ and chloroquine reflect an increased recognition of retinal toxicity, which has been attributed to access to more longitudinal data as well as improvements in structural and functional imaging modalities for monitoring ocular toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease/abstract/60,62,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,62,80</a>].</p><p>Tablets may be split or variable dosing (eg, alternating or skipping doses on certain days) may be required to meet the recommended dose limits.

(See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We advise assessment of ocular health prior to, or within a year of, starting long-term antimalarial drug therapy. The baseline examination should include a fundus examination of the macula to rule out any underlying disease that may interfere with the interpretation of screening tests. The frequency of screening during the first five years of treatment should be individualized based upon assessment of risk. At least annual screening should be performed for patients receiving treatment for more than five years. Patients should be alert for any change in visual acuity and should seek medical attention promptly if any visual loss is noted. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Ocular health'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the treatment of rheumatic diseases, we typically use standard daily doses of HCQ (non-weight-based, eg, up to 400 mg) in individuals weighing 80 kg or more. In patients weighing less than 80 kg, we use a lower daily dose of HCQ up to the maximum of 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of real body weight. This dosing limit minimizes the risk of retinal toxicity during long-term (one year or more) therapy. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Ocular health'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HCQ may be relatively safe and appropriate to continue during pregnancy in some patients.
