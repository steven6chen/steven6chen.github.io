In the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, Wegner, a German investigator, was the first to use peritoneal solutions in animals; he reported that hypertonic solutions increased in volume when injected into the peritoneal cavity. Additional investigations found that hypertonic solutions increased and hypotonic solutions decreased peritoneal fluid volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-dialysis-solutions/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Various different investigators subsequently evaluated the efficacy of treating uremia by instilling fluids into the peritoneal cavity:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gantar instilled saline solution in the peritoneal cavity of uremic guinea pigs and subsequently treated a uremic woman with peritoneal dialysis solution containing saline.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heusser added dextrose to the peritoneal dialysis solution to improve ultrafiltration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 1938, Rhoads added lactate to the peritoneal dialysis fluid to correct acidosis.</p><p/><p>Several <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peritoneal-dialysis-solutions-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">peritoneal dialysis solutions</a> were subsequently used in the management of uremic patients.

The earlier solutions were packaged in glass bottles, but they are currently available in several sizes of collapsible plastic bags. The constituents can be broadly divided into osmotic agents, buffers, and electrolytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-dialysis-solutions/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Osmotic agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fluid removal is essential in dialysis patients. Osmotic agents, being hyperosmolar, allow net water removal by altering the osmotic pressure gradient between the peritoneal dialysis solution and plasma water (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-solute-clearance-and-ultrafiltration-in-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of solute clearance and ultrafiltration in peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a>). The initial <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peritoneal-dialysis-solutions-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">peritoneal dialysis solutions</a> were saline solutions, but, since the 1940s, <strong>dextrose</strong> has been commonly used as the osmotic agent.

With these agents, a high concentration is required to produce an osmolar gradient, which could lead to hyperviscosity, thereby affecting dialysis inflow and outflow.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H125248406\"><span class=\"h4\">Glucose polymer-containing solutions (icodextrin)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucose polymers (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=icodextrin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">icodextrin</a>) are mixtures of <span class=\"nowrap\">oligo/polysaccharides</span> of variable chain lengths. Initially, low-molecular-weight <span class=\"nowrap\">oligo/polysaccharides</span> with weights of approximately 900 DA were tried with limited success. Larger molecules with weights of 20,000 DA have been introduced in Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-dialysis-solutions/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Icodextrin dialysate (Extraneal) is the major glucose polymer utilized in peritoneal dialysis.</p><p>Glucose polymers were introduced to replace glucose-containing solutions by offering the possible advantages of decreased absorption of solute and increased ultrafiltration for a longer period of time.</p><p>The use of a glucose polymer as an osmotic agent is particularly appealing as a substitute for glucose solutions, particularly in diabetics, in those who require long dwell, and in patients whose ultrafiltration capacity may need to be enhanced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-dialysis-solutions/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. The reduced carbohydrate load also may provide some long-term metabolic advantage. This was suggested by one randomized, controlled trial in which 251 diabetic patients were assigned to a control group (dialyzed using standard dextrose solution) or to a low-dextrose treatment group (dialyzed using a combination of dextrose-based solutions, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=icodextrin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">icodextrin</a>, and amino acids) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-dialysis-solutions/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. At six months, by intention-to-treat analysis, the mean glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) was improved in the treatment group but not in the control group, with a resulting 0.5 percent difference between groups (95% CI 0.1-0.8). There were also improvements in serum triglycerides, very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), and apolipoprotein B in the treatment, but not control, group.</p><p>However, there were more deaths and serious adverse events in the treatment group, many of which were related to volume overload. There were 5 deaths in the control group and 11 in the intervention group. These data suggest that, although low-dextrose dialysate may improve metabolic parameters, volume status should be followed closely.</p><p>The most commonly used glucose polymer is a 7.5 percent solution. The blood concentrations of maltose, maltotriose, and other <span class=\"nowrap\">oligo/polysaccharides</span> have been shown to increase with these agents, possibly resulting in adverse reactions. Several studies, for example, have reported a relatively high incidence of cutaneous reactions (approximately 15 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-dialysis-solutions/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The reported incidence of culture-negative peritonitis with glucose polymer solutions ranges from 9 to nearly 50 percent. This is thought to be due to contamination of some batches with a bacterial wall breakdown product, peptidoglycan. The manufacturer subsequently had a voluntary recall of the suspect batches of dialysate, with a resultant decrease in incidence of the peritonitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-dialysis-solutions/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-and-therapy-of-peritonitis-in-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology and therapy of peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, a systematic review of five randomized trials (607 patients) showed no increase in the risk of peritonitis with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=icodextrin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">icodextrin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-dialysis-solutions/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>In addition, both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=icodextrin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">icodextrin</a> and maltose can interfere with or cause falsely elevated glucose results, possibly leading to inappropriate therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-dialysis-solutions/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. Thus, the labeling for icodextrin dialysate includes a warning that &quot;blood glucose monitoring must be done with a glucose-specific method (monitor and test strips) to avoid interference by maltose.&quot;</p><p>In one retrospective study, the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=icodextrin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">icodextrin</a> was associated with a lower risk of technique failure related to noncompliance and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-dialysis-solutions/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In the systematic review cited above, in three randomized trials (290 patients), icodextrin did not alter risk of technique failure; however, none of the included trials were sufficiently powered to show such a difference, and the follow-up time was short [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-dialysis-solutions/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H125248418\"><span class=\"h4\">Polypeptides</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Polypeptides may be used as osmotic agents by the hydrolysis of a 5 percent solution of a milk protein with the enzymes trypsin and chymotrypsin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-dialysis-solutions/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Compared with a 2.5 percent glucose solution, this polypeptide solution yielded twice the ultrafiltrate volume after one hour of dwell. Furthermore, only 3 percent of the peptide was absorbed from the solution. In another study, 10 stable continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients received either 1 percent peptide with 1.36 percent glucose (osmolality of 381 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg)</span> or 2.27 percent glucose (osmolality of 404 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-dialysis-solutions/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The peptide solution was well tolerated, resulting in a similar clearance as the 2.27 percent glucose solution. Furthermore, there were no irritant effects of the peptide solution on the peritoneum, and the plasma amino acid profile was similar in both groups. Thus, short-chain polypeptides were absorbed less than glucose, and their ultrafiltration capacity was similar to 2.27 percent glucose. However, long-term studies are needed to evaluate the effects of peptide on the nutritional status of peritoneal dialysis patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H125248433\"><span class=\"h4\">Dextrans</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neutral dextran had been tried as an osmotic agent since the 1960s. Initially, 6 percent dextran in saline was utilized, but this concentration was unable to achieve good ultrafiltration.</p><p>A 10 percent solution provided good ultrafiltration, but 40 to 60 percent of dextran was absorbed over a six-hour dwell time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-dialysis-solutions/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Accumulation of dextran in the body can result in blockage of the reticuloendothelial system; thus, it is <strong>not</strong> considered a suitable alternative for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peritoneal-dialysis-solutions-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">peritoneal dialysis solutions</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-dialysis-solutions/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Low-molecular-weight agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Low-molecular-weight agents, such as dextrose (eg, glucose-containing solutions), amino acids, xylitol, and glycerol, have weights of 90 to 200 DA. Among these agents, dextrose is the most commonly used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H369050792\"><span class=\"h4\">Glucose-containing solutions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucose is the most commonly utilized osmotic agent in peritoneal dialysis. It comes in three different dextrose monohydrate concentrations: 1.5, 2.5, and 4.25 percent (see below).</p><p>Glucose is not the ideal osmotic agent, because it is easily absorbed, leading to short-lived ultrafiltration. Its absorption can also lead to several metabolic complications, such as hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and weight gain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-dialysis-solutions/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Furthermore, the high glucose concentration, low pH, and glucose degradation products (GDPs) of these solutions can affect peritoneal host defense mechanisms by inhibiting phagocytosis and bactericidal activity due in part to overall bioincompatibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-dialysis-solutions/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Neutral pH, low GDP, or &quot;biocompatible&quot; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peritoneal-dialysis-solutions-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">peritoneal dialysis solutions</a> have been developed in an attempt to decrease the number of GDPs of dialysis solutions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-dialysis-solutions/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. The use of such solutions may preserve daily urine volume, though not necessarily residual renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-dialysis-solutions/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Residual renal function in this setting is defined as solute (eg, urea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> creatinine) clearance.</p><p>One multicenter, randomized trial compared biocompatible dialysate with conventional dialysate among 185 peritoneal dialysis patients with residual renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-dialysis-solutions/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. At two years, there was no difference in the rate of decline in renal function. However, the use of the biocompatible solution associated with a decreased risk of anuria (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.36, 95% CI 0.13-0.96) and a decreased rate of peritonitis (0.30 versus 0.49 episodes per patient-year) compared with conventional dialysate.</p><p>A randomized, open-label study compared three biocompatible dialysate solutions to conventional dialysate solution among 150 incident CAPD patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-dialysis-solutions/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. At 12 months, patients who used biocompatible solutions had better preservation of daily urine volume compared with those who used a conventional dialysate solution (959 versus 798 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day),</span> but there was no difference between groups in the rate of decline of residual renal function.</p><p>One retrospective study of over 2000 patients has suggested a survival benefit associated with a neutral pH low-GDP solution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-dialysis-solutions/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Randomized, prospective studies are required to accurately determine the possible survival benefits associated with this solution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-dialysis-solutions/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p>The main advantage of dextrose is that it is cheap, safe, and easily available. Furthermore, nephrologists are comfortable using dextrose solutions as they have been in the market for a long time. To date, no other osmotic agent has proven superior to dextrose-containing solutions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H369050798\"><span class=\"h4\">Amino acid-containing solutions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nutrition is being increasingly recognized as an important predictor of outcome in dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-dialysis-solutions/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutritional-status-and-protein-intake-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutritional status and protein intake in peritoneal dialysis patients&quot;</a>). Malnutrition is common in peritoneal dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-dialysis-solutions/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>] and has been associated with higher mortality and higher hospitalization rates (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient survival and maintenance dialysis&quot;</a>). Whereas several factors are responsible for the low albumin levels in dialysis patients, peritoneal dialysis patients tend to lose significant amounts of protein in the dialysate. It is estimated that up to 15 g of protein and 2 to 4 g of amino acids per day may be lost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-dialysis-solutions/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>].</p><p>Amino acid-containing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peritoneal-dialysis-solutions-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">peritoneal dialysis solutions</a> have therefore been utilized to possibly improve nutritional status in peritoneal dialysis patients. The rationale behind this approach was that the absorbed amino acids from the peritoneal dialysis solution might help contribute to protein synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-dialysis-solutions/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>However, early experiences with amino acid solutions were not very successful, with little to no nutritional benefit evident in studied patients. One explanation for the lack of benefit is that earlier amino acid solutions were not well designed for peritoneal dialysis. By comparison, subsequent studies found that 1.1 percent amino acid solutions are as effective an osmotic agent as 1.36 percent dextrose solutions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-dialysis-solutions/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Such studies have also shown optimal utility when amino acids were administered with a nonprotein energy source.</p><p>The amino acid solution used in these studies was a 1.1 percent solution of a combination of essential amino acids and some nonessential amino acids (Nutrineal). The pH of this solution is 6.7, and osmolality is 365 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-dialysis-solutions/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In various studies, this solution has been shown to improve the nutritional status of dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-dialysis-solutions/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The common side effects include worsening of acidosis and a rise in blood urea nitrogen (BUN).</p><p>The following guidelines should be considered when prescribing amino acid <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peritoneal-dialysis-solutions-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">peritoneal dialysis solutions</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-dialysis-solutions/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-treatment-of-malnutrition-in-maintenance-hemodialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and treatment of malnutrition in maintenance hemodialysis patients&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They are indicated for use only in malnourished or diabetic patients <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> those with recurrent peritonitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 1.1 percent amino acid solution consisting of predominantly essential amino acids (required by dialysis patients) should be used.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sufficient concurrent alternative caloric intake should be guaranteed.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H369050804\"><span class=\"h4\">Xylitol-containing solution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Xylitol has been tried as an osmotic agent in diabetic patients. A preliminary study found that its use helped decrease metabolic complications of diabetes, as well as blood glucose levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-dialysis-solutions/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. However, it is not used, because of several potentially serious side effects, including lactic acidosis, hyperuricemia, carcinogenicity, and deteriorating liver function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H369050810\"><span class=\"h4\">Glycerol-containing solution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glycerol gained interest as an osmotic agent because of its smaller molecular weight, relatively high osmolality per unit mass, and a higher pH than glucose solutions. It was therefore initially proposed as the alternative solution in diabetic patients.</p><p>However, because of rapid diffusion into blood, it produces less ultrafiltration than glucose. In addition, long-term trials found that the insulin requirement was not significantly different after three to four months; furthermore, its regular use may lead to accumulation of glycerol and cause hyperosmolality of the plasma and hypertriglyceridemia. Thus, glycerol solutions have a limited role in diabetic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-dialysis-solutions/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Buffers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three different agents have been used as buffers to control acidosis in peritoneal dialysis patients.

In North America, the sodium concentration of the dialysate is principally 132 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span>. Since fluid removal with peritoneal dialysis is mainly by convection, water removal from the plasma exceeds sodium removal, thereby possibly leading to hypernatremia. Thus, the relatively low sodium concentration in the peritoneal dialysis fluid helps offset the predilection for hypernatremia. Nomograms are available to predict net sodium removal, adjusted for glucose concentration of the solution.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Calcium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the 1970s, the most commonly used calcium concentration in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peritoneal-dialysis-solutions-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">peritoneal dialysis solutions</a> was 1.75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span>. The optimal peritoneal dialysis calcium concentration is unclear. Hypercalcemia is common in patients using 1.75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> of calcium in the dialysate, which is due to the concurrent administration of calcium-containing phosphate binders and vitamin D analogs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hyperphosphatemia-in-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hyperphosphatemia in chronic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Thus, an increasing number of centers are now using low-calcium concentrations in the dialysate, which can help in the treatment of hyperphosphatemia with calcium-containing phosphate binders. Studies have shown that lower dialysate calcium (1.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> seems to be safe in the majority of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-dialysis-solutions/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. However, hypocalcemia may develop in some patients, particularly in those with poor compliance with calcium-containing phosphorus binders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-dialysis-solutions/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Magnesium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypermagnesemia is a frequent occurrence in peritoneal dialysis patients. Available <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peritoneal-dialysis-solutions-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">peritoneal dialysis solutions</a> contain magnesium at concentrations of 0.5 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. In most studies, the use of 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> of magnesium in the dialysate solution resulted in hypermagnesemia. Since persistently elevated magnesium levels may cause bone disease, the 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> concentration is therefore more commonly used to optimize the serum magnesium concentration. A zero-dialysate magnesium concentration has also been attempted to allow the use of oral magnesium salt as an additional phosphate binder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-dialysis-solutions/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Potassium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Potassium is usually not added in the commercial dialysate; potassium concentration in commercially available dialysate can vary from 0 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. Zero-potassium dialysate tends to maintain serum potassium around 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. Interestingly, 10 to 36 percent of peritoneal dialysis patients develop hypokalemia, which could be corrected by adding 1 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> of potassium to the dialysate, as required. However, a strongly preferred method is to supplement potassium orally.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">AVAILABLE DEXTROSE-BASED SOLUTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=peritoneal-dialysis-solutions-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Peritoneal dialysis solutions</a> are available in different volumes, dextrose concentrations, and formulations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Volume</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=peritoneal-dialysis-solutions-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Peritoneal dialysis solutions</a> are commonly available in 1, 2, 2.5, 3, 5, and 6 liter bags.
