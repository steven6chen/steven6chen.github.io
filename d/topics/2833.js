This topic will review the presentation, diagnosis, and non-operative management of capitate fractures. General overviews of wrist pain and carpal fractures, as well as topics devoted to other specific carpal fractures in adults, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-acute-wrist-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with acute wrist pain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-subacute-or-chronic-wrist-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with subacute or chronic wrist pain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-carpal-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of carpal fractures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scaphoid-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Scaphoid fractures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hamate-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hamate fractures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lunate-fractures-and-perilunate-injuries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lunate fractures and perilunate injuries&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trapezoid-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trapezoid fractures&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3605971092\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hand fractures are among the most common of the extremity injuries, accounting for approximately 18 percent of all fractures. Carpal bone fractures comprise between 8 and 19 percent of hand fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capitate-fractures/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Fractures to the bones of the distal carpal row (trapezium, trapezoid, capitate, and hamate) are less frequent than fractures of bones in the proximal row (scaphoid, lunate, triquetrum, and pisiform). Capitate fractures account for approximately three percent of all carpal fractures, based primarily on large series in which computed tomography was used for definitive diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capitate-fractures/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The capitate is the largest carpal bone. Distally, it articulates primarily with the base of the third metacarpal and a small portion of the fourth; radially with the trapezoid; proximally with the scaphoid and lunate; and on its ulnar side with the hamate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F70211\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70211 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78359\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78359 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56302\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56302 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69097\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69097 \">figure 3</a>). The capitate resembles the scaphoid in that its blood supply at the proximal pole is provided by vessels coursing distal to proximal, possibly increasing the risk of fracture complications from interruption of the blood supply. The anatomy of the wrist is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anatomy-and-basic-biomechanics-of-the-wrist\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anatomy and basic biomechanics of the wrist&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Capitate fractures occur from a number of mechanisms. Falls onto an outstretched hand and motor vehicle crashes are most commonly cited. Cadaver studies suggest that an injury sustained with the wrist in marked extension and radial deviation can cause the dorsal lip of the distal radius to contact the scaphoid, causing a fracture at its waist, and transmitting force to the capitate, which can fracture at its neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capitate-fractures/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. The following image depicts this relatively complex mechanism of injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F110591\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110591 \">figure 4</a>). Excessive palmar flexion during trauma may also predispose the capitate to injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capitate-fractures/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Isolated fractures can occur from a dorsal blow or crush injury. Of note, injuries sustained from excessive palmar or dorsiflexion under a load (eg, falling onto an outstretched hand) may also cause dislocations or fracture dislocations involving additional carpal bones (eg, scaphoid). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scaphoid-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Scaphoid fractures&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Isolated capitate fracture is uncommon; concomitant carpal or metacarpal fractures <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dislocations are much more common. In the largest series reported (53 capitate fractures), only 20 percent of capitate fractures were isolated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capitate-fractures/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The most common injury pattern reported is a &quot;scaphocapitate syndrome.&quot; This hyperextension injury involves a force exerted by the radial styloid that causes fractures of both the scaphoid waist and proximal capitate. Depending upon the force, this injury may result in perilunate dislocation, as well as a rotation of the capitate's proximal fracture fragment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capitate-fractures/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Other concomitant injuries can include fractures of the distal radius, hamate, metacarpal, or triquetrum most commonly; and the distal ulna, trapezoid, trapezium, lunate, pisiform, or phalanges less commonly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capitate-fractures/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-acute-wrist-pain#H26912264\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with acute wrist pain&quot;, section on 'Perilunate and lunate dislocations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">SYMPTOMS AND EXAMINATION FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient with a capitate fracture typically presents with pain and swelling on the dorsum of the wrist or proximal hand. There is tenderness dorsally over the area of the capitate (just proximal to the third metacarpal and in line with Lister's tubercle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78359\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78359 \">figure 1</a>)). However, if there is a concomitant soft tissue injury <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fracture of other parts of the carpus, especially with perilunate dislocations, pain may be more widespread about the wrist and hand. Range of motion of the wrist will likely be diminished due to pain, as will strength of the muscles whose tendons cross the wrist. Neurovascular status in the hand and fingers should be assessed, but compromise in an isolated capitate fracture is unlikely. When associated with a dislocation, however, neurovascular injury is more likely.</p><p>The capitate is palpable on the dorsal wrist at the base of the third metacarpal (MC) but may be difficult to distinguish from the MC. It can be located by palpating the third MC dorsally starting mid-shaft and working toward its base, which is often slightly prominent. Just proximal to this prominence is the capitate. It should lie in the straight line drawn from Lister's tubercle to the third MCP joint with the wrist in neutral deviation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78359\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78359 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Capitate fractures often evade detection with plain radiographs, but nevertheless, imaging should begin with standard wrist views, including anteroposterior (AP), lateral, and oblique. These views are helpful for assessing dislocation. In addition, if there is any tenderness of the scaphoid, we suggest obtaining scaphoid and clenched-fist views of the wrist. The following images show examples of capitate fractures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F96309\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef96309 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F90280\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef90280 \">image 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F90279\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef90279 \">image 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F96310\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef96310 \">image 5</a>).</p><p>Studies using computed tomography (CT) as the gold standard have reported a poor sensitivity of plain radiographs for detecting capitate fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capitate-fractures/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Therefore, if plain radiographs are unrevealing but clinical suspicion persists, CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be obtained. In a series of 53 capitate fractures, CT or MRI was needed for diagnosis in 79 percent of cases, despite plain radiographs being obtained initially in all but one case [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capitate-fractures/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>CT is highly accurate for identifying fracture or dislocation and for assessing joint surfaces when there is any question of intra-articular fracture with displacement. In addition, CT can delineate the extent of a fracture and any displacement in greater detail [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capitate-fractures/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. MRI has the additional value of detecting both acute and chronic bony and soft tissue injuries. If significant soft tissue injury (eg, ligament rupture or dislocation) is suspected, MRI should be obtained. MRI is useful for detecting occult fractures and may reveal early vascular problems within the proximal capitate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capitate-fractures/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Capitate fracture patterns can be classified into three groups: body fractures, avulsion tip fractures (dorsal or volar), and shear depression fractures. In addition, bone contusions, or edema of the capitate without apparent fracture, may be seen with MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capitate-fractures/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In the case of &quot;scaphocapitate syndrome,&quot; fracture occurs in the proximal pole (neck) of the capitate. With such injuries, the proximal portion of the capitate may appear to be seated appropriately in the fossa of the lunate, but the fragment can rotate 90 to 180 degrees, resulting in the proximal articular surface pointing distally.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H51863101\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of capitate fracture may occasionally be made by plain radiography, in conjunction with a suggestive history and examination findings. However, as plain radiographs demonstrate poor sensitivity for these injuries, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is usually needed when fracture is suspected but initial radiographs are normal and a definitive diagnosis is required. In addition, advanced imaging is useful for detecting the concomitant injuries that are frequently present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55172003\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Capitate fractures are a heterogeneous group with a high incidence (80 percent) of concomitant injury. Diagnoses that may coincide or be confused with a capitate fracture include those described below. The differential diagnosis for acute wrist pain is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-acute-wrist-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with acute wrist pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2325001105\"><span class=\"h2\">Fracture of the scaphoid, trapezoid or other carpal bones</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fractures of other carpal bones are a more common cause of acute wrist injury than a capitate fracture. The scaphoid is the most commonly fractured carpal bone. Concomitant scaphoid and capitate fracture is slightly more common than isolated capitate fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capitate-fractures/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Carpal fractures may cause diffuse tenderness along the radial aspect of the dorsal wrist. Snuffbox tenderness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82858\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82858 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82859\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82859 \">picture 2</a>) is suggestive but not diagnostic of scaphoid fracture. Diagnostic imaging to identify such fractures should include standard wrist and scaphoid views, but advanced imaging with CT or MRI may be required. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-carpal-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of carpal fractures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scaphoid-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Scaphoid fractures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trapezoid-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trapezoid fractures&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1204984720\"><span class=\"h2\">Fractures of the third metacarpal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Third metacarpal fracture is suggested by pain, swelling, and tenderness dorsally at the base of the third metacarpal. Standard radiographs of the wrist (AP, lateral, oblique) are typically sufficient for diagnosis, but CT can be useful to determine the position of fragments and full extent of injury. In a series of 53 capitate fractures, 22 percent occurred with concomitant metacarpal fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capitate-fractures/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3186618337\"><span class=\"h2\">Scapholunate ligament sprain and instability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A fall onto an outstretched hand with the wrist extended can disrupt the scapholunate ligament. Patients complain of swelling and pain over the dorsal wrist, grip weakness, and painful or decreased wrist motion. Tenderness at the scapholunate junction is common. This can be palpated just distal to Lister's tubercle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78359\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78359 \">figure 1</a>). The scaphoid shift test can help detect ligamentous instability; it is described in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-subacute-or-chronic-wrist-pain#H5769529\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with subacute or chronic wrist pain&quot;, section on 'Special tests'</a>.) </p><p>Plain radiographs should be obtained if scapholunate injury is suspected, including the &quot;clenched fist&quot; view, which may show widening between the scaphoid and lunate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F98727\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef98727 \">image 6</a>). Advanced imaging should be obtained if clinical suspicion is high, as early surgical management is optimal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-subacute-or-chronic-wrist-pain#H5769574\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with subacute or chronic wrist pain&quot;, section on 'Scapholunate instability'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2142456211\"><span class=\"h2\">Distal radius fracture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This most common fracture of the wrist and hand is usually sustained from a fall onto an outstretched hand. Tenderness is present at the distal radius, sometimes accompanied by deformity and ecchymosis. Diagnosis is generally made with plain radiographs. Approximately one quarter of capitate fractures have a concomitant distal radius fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capitate-fractures/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=distal-radius-fractures-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Distal radius fractures in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3884193914\"><span class=\"h2\">Wrist sprain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the absence of fracture or dislocation, sprain of any of the many wrist ligaments or the capsule is likely after acute trauma. Examination typically reveals wrist tenderness and often swelling, but plain radiographs are negative. Advanced imaging may be needed to definitively rule out a fracture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-acute-wrist-pain#H3002805\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with acute wrist pain&quot;, section on 'Wrist sprain'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR SURGICAL REFERRAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with persistent vascular or neurologic deficits associated with a capitate fracture should be referred immediately to a hand surgeon. Open fractures also require immediate surgical referral. </p><p>Patients with displaced capitate fractures (displacement &gt;2 mm), delayed diagnosis of nondisplaced fractures, and concomitant carpal fractures or ligamentous instability should be seen by a hand surgeon for definitive care within three to seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capitate-fractures/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since capitate fractures are usually accompanied by other significant wrist injuries, referral to a hand surgeon is strongly suggested. However, primary care clinicians with experience managing fractures may elect to manage the patient with an isolated, nondisplaced capitate body or a dorsal (volar) avulsion fracture without associated dislocation or scapholunate ligament instability.</p><p>Icing and elevation of the wrist above the level of the heart should be stressed. Basic fracture care is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-acute-fracture-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of acute fracture management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-definitive-fracture-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of definitive fracture management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If there is marked wrist swelling at presentation, a sugar-tong splint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50501\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50501 \">figure 5</a>) can be used for initial immobilization. Subsequently, a short arm cast is placed once swelling subsides. If swelling is minimal at presentation, a short arm cast can be placed without delay. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-techniques-for-splinting-of-musculoskeletal-injuries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic techniques for splinting of musculoskeletal injuries&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-definitive-fracture-management#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of definitive fracture management&quot;, section on 'Casting'</a>.)</p><p>If initial radiographs are negative (as they usually are), but suspicion for a fracture remains, immobilize as usual for a known capitate fracture and obtain CT or MRI within about seven days.</p><p>Treatment of capitate fractures is based on expert opinion, as these fractures are rare and the literature is limited to case series and reports. It is reasonable to treat isolated, nondisplaced capitate fractures with cast immobilization for four to six weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capitate-fractures/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient being managed nonoperatively should be assessed for cast integrity after approximately three weeks, or as needed should symptoms of poor cast fit develop. Biweekly cast checks may be prudent in very active patients.</p><p>Casting should be continued for four to six weeks for isolated capitate fractures with &le;2 mm displacement. When the cast is removed after this interval, healing should be confirmed both clinically by the absence of point tenderness and radiographically by callus formation. If there is a question about proper healing, a CT scan can identify crossing trabeculae at the site of union [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capitate-fractures/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. If nonunion is encountered after six weeks of casting, the patient should be referred to a hand surgeon. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-acute-fracture-management#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of acute fracture management&quot;, section on 'Initial radiologic assessment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H760420106\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a series of 53 capitate fractures, posttraumatic degenerative arthrosis was the most common complication, occurring in 7.5 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capitate-fractures/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In &quot;scaphocapitate syndrome,&quot; rotational displacement of the capitate fracture fragment can lead to avascular necrosis (AVN), as the vascular supply of the bone flows distal to proximal. Fractures of the head and neck may also be complicated by AVN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capitate-fractures/abstract/5,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13</a>]. However, such complications are uncommon, and in the above series, there were no cases of AVN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capitate-fractures/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The authors surmised that this low rate, relative to the higher rates reported in older and smaller case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capitate-fractures/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>], may have been due to earlier treatment stemming from more frequent use of computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capitate-fractures/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Clinical signs consistent with AVN include chronic pain and tenderness of the capitate; radiographic evidence includes partial collapse and increased density of the affected portion of the bone. Any of these findings should prompt advanced imaging (CT or MRI) and referral to a hand surgeon.</p><p>Other fracture complications are described separately but are uncommon with isolated capitate fractures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-fracture-management-early-and-late-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of fracture management: Early and late complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>After four to six weeks of casting, the wrist will have lost strength and mobility. Depending on the clinical circumstances, formal physical or occupational therapy, or a home exercise program, can be used to help the patient regain full function. The patient can stop the program once full mobility and strength are regained.</p><p>A basic home exercise program might consist of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perform passive stretches twice daily, holding each stretch for 30 seconds. Stretch the wrist in flexion, extension, ulnar deviation, and radial deviation. The hand and wrist can be soaked in very warm water for 5 minutes prior to stretching to facilitate motion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perform motion and strength exercises after stretching. Exercises should include active wrist circles 10 times in each direction, followed by two sets of 15 repetitions using appropriate resistance (eg, elastic band, dumbbell) for each of the following: wrist flexion, wrist extension, ulnar deviation, and radial deviation.</p><p/><p>The patient's pain, motion and function should be assessed about two weeks after cast removal. Those who are having persistent, significant pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> functional impairment may benefit from a referral to physical therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RETURN TO SPORT OR WORK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once any acute pain has resolved, patients with isolated, nondisplaced fractures treated with casting can likely return to full activity, including sports, while casted (assuming this is permitted in their sport). After definitive casting for four to six weeks, the patient can use a semi-rigid brace to support the wrist while performing exercises to regain full range of motion and strength. We suggest that athletes continue to use protective splinting for three months or until the wrist has regained full strength and range of motion. </p><p>Patients with other associated injuries&ndash;especially those requiring surgery&ndash;have a much more prolonged recovery and may not be capable of resuming their highest level of athletic competition due to the common sequelae of wrist stiffness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capitate-fractures/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isolated capitate fractures are relatively rare.

If radiographs are negative but suspicion persists, advanced imaging with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is indicated. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis for capitate fracture includes fracture of the scaphoid, trapezoid, and other carpal bones, fracture of the third metacarpal, scapholunate ligament injury, distal radius fracture, and wrist sprain. (See <a href=\"#H55172003\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indications for immediate surgical referral include open fracture, persistent neurovascular deficit, and carpal dislocation. Patients with displaced capitate fractures (displacement &gt;2 mm), delayed diagnosis of nondisplaced fractures, and concomitant carpal fractures or ligamentous instability should be seen by a hand surgeon for definitive care within three to seven days. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Indications for surgical referral'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nondisplaced capitate fractures without comminution or significant associated injury can be managed by primary care clinicians, and are treated with a short arm cast for four to six weeks. Healing should be confirmed both clinically by the absence of point tenderness and radiographically by callus formation. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Initial treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following four to six weeks of casting, a semi-rigid brace is useful to support the wrist while performing exercises to regain full range of motion and strength. We suggest that athletes continue to use protective splinting for three months or until the wrist has regained full strength and range of motion. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Recommendations for return to sport or work'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posttraumatic degenerative arthrosis is the most common complication of capitate fracture. There is a risk of avascular necrosis of the proximal pole as a delayed sequela, but this complication is uncommon. (See <a href=\"#H760420106\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capitate-fractures/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">van Onselen EB, Karim RB, Hage JJ, Ritt MJ.
