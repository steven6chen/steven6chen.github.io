Many women with RA are of childbearing age, which highlights the importance of careful family planning especially in patients who are taking medications or who have active disease.</p><p>In many women with RA, disease activity improves substantially during pregnancy. However, some women's RA flares up or stays active during pregnancy. Thus, it is often necessary to change or modify treatment of RA during pregnancy to control flares while minimizing the risks of RA treatments to the developing fetus.</p><p>A number of other topics about RA are available separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rheumatoid-arthritis-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Rheumatoid arthritis symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rheumatoid-arthritis-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Rheumatoid arthritis treatment (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disease-modifying-antirheumatic-drugs-dmards-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CHANGES IN RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS DURING PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many changes to the immune system occur normally during pregnancy. These changes enable a fetus to grow and develop. Some of these changes contribute to the improvement of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) symptoms during pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Disease activity during pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 50 to 60 percent of women with RA notice improvement of RA signs and symptoms during pregnancy. The decrease in disease activity generally starts in the first trimester and lasts through delivery. Unfortunately, we cannot predict which patients will get better during pregnancy.</p><p>It is sometimes difficult to distinguish between the common discomforts of pregnancy and the symptoms of RA. Pregnancy discomforts that are similar to those of RA include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fatigue</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling of the hands, feet, or ankles</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Joint pain, especially in the low back</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shortness of breath</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Numbness or pain in one or both hands (caused by carpal tunnel syndrome of pregnancy)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy outcome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most reports show that there is no increase in stillbirth or miscarriage in women who have RA. However, some medications, particularly high-dose steroids, may increase the risk of having a smaller than normal infant and may increase the risk of premature rupture of the membranes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CARE BEFORE PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) should discuss their desire to become pregnant with an arthritis specialist (rheumatologist) and an obstetrical care provider before trying to become pregnant.</p><p>General recommendations that apply to all women who are considering pregnancy can be found separately. In addition:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a woman takes prescription or nonprescription medications for RA, these should be reviewed with a healthcare provider. Some medications are safe during pregnancy while others are not. In some cases, an alternate medication can be substituted for an unsafe drug.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women who take methotrexate should stop it at least one month before trying to conceive, although the manufacturer suggests discontinuation of this medication three full menstrual cycles before attempting pregnancy. This waiting period is necessary to allow the effects of methotrexate on the body to pass so that it will be safe to become pregnant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women who take leflunomide must stop it for at least two years before trying to conceive, unless a course of treatments to eliminate the drug from the body is used. Thus, women of childbearing potential should discuss use of this medication with their arthritis specialist.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Am I ready for pregnancy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is common for women with long-term medical problems to be worried about how their health will be affected by pregnancy and parenting. Women with RA often have an improvement in symptoms of pain and fatigue during pregnancy, but then may have a worsening of these problems after delivery. Thus, it is important to be prepared for the changes that a new child may bring, including interrupted sleep, fatigue, stress, and anxiety. Close communication with an obstetric and a rheumatologic care provider, and support from family and friends, can help to ease the additional challenges of being pregnant and raising a child.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS TREATMENT DURING PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) flare during pregnancy and require treatment. However, some medications used in the treatment of RA can be harmful to the fetus. The benefit of any medication must be balanced with the potential risk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Care during pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During pregnancy, care of women with RA is usually shared between a rheumatologist and an obstetrical provider.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Medications during pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The safety of RA medications during pregnancy and their effects on the fetus are not always clearly known. For each patient, the decision about which drugs to use will depend upon their response to treatment, the activity of their disease, their overall medical status, and other individual factors.</p><p>Methotrexate and leflunomide should be avoided completely during pregnancy, due to a significant risk of fetal harm. If a woman takes one of these medications during pregnancy, she should speak to her clinician immediately (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Care before pregnancy'</a> above). Other medications such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be taken more safely during one part of the pregnancy but not another.</p><p>For some patients, the benefits of the drug in controlling disease and in maintaining function may outweigh the possible risks to the mother or to the fetus. The use of any medication for arthritis during pregnancy is thus a matter that a patient and her rheumatologist should discuss, so that potentially dangerous medications can be avoided and the individual risks and benefits of any other drug can be carefully weighed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=safety-of-antiinflammatory-and-immunosuppressive-drugs-in-rheumatic-diseases-during-pregnancy-and-lactation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Safety of antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs in rheumatic diseases during pregnancy and lactation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AFTER DELIVERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 90 percent of women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) experience a flare during the postpartum period, usually within the first three months and particularly after a woman's first pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatoid-arthritis-and-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Many experts recommend restarting RA medications in the first few weeks after delivery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Breastfeeding and rheumatoid arthritis activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The postpartum period is a common time for women with RA to have a flare of the disease, so it is difficult to know if breastfeeding further increases this risk. However, there are numerous benefits of breastfeeding for both women and their infants. For these reasons, women with RA who want to breastfeed are encouraged to do so. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deciding-to-breastfeed-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Deciding to breastfeed (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Medications and breastfeeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many of the same restrictions on medication use during pregnancy apply also to breastfeeding mothers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatoid-arthritis-and-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shorter-acting nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, can be used in lactating women.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low-dose aspirin (81 mg a day) is compatible with nursing, but higher doses should be avoided.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prednisone can be taken in low doses. At doses higher than 20 mg a day, it is recommended to pump and discard breast milk that is produced during the first four hours after ingestion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Methotrexate and leflunomide should be avoided during breastfeeding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Azathioprine is compatible with nursing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The data are equivocal regarding cyclosporine so this medication should be avoided unless there is no alternative.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors such as etanercept, infliximab, or adalimumab are compatible with breastfeeding.</p><p/><p>The quality of information regarding medication safety in breastfeeding varies.
