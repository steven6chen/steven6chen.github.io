This results in a cognitive or perceptual disturbance that is not better accounted for by a preexisting, established, or evolving dementia. Delirium develops over a short period of time (usually hours to days) and tends to fluctuate during the course of the day. Delirium is typically caused by a medical condition, substance intoxication, or medication side effect.</p><p>Delirium is considered by some to be a specific type of confusional state that is characterized by increased vigilance along with psychomotor and autonomic overactivity and manifested as agitation, tremulousness, and hallucinations. In this discussion, however, the term delirium will be used synonymously with acute confusional state and will include states characterized by somnolence and decreased arousal, so-called hypoactive delirium. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-delirium-and-confusional-states#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of delirium and confusional states&quot;, section on 'Definition and terminology'</a>.) </p><p>The management of delirium is based primarily upon expert consensus and observational studies, and only a small number of controlled clinical trials, which are difficult to perform in patients with cognitive impairment. The preponderance of evidence is most compelling for primary prevention of delirium using non-pharmacologic, multicomponent approaches targeted broadly at high risk patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. &#160;Prevention and therapy of delirium are based on the following principles: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoiding factors known to cause or aggravate delirium, such as multiple medications, dehydration, immobilization, sensory impairment, and sleep disturbance</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identifying and treating the underlying acute illness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Providing supportive and restorative care to prevent further physical and cognitive decline</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Where appropriate, controlling dangerous and severely disruptive behaviors using low dose, short acting pharmacologic agents so the first three steps can be accomplished</p><p/><p>The prevention, treatment, and prognosis of delirium will be reviewed here. The definition, epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of delirium are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-delirium-and-confusional-states\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of delirium and confusional states&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No intervention or group of interventions reliably prevents delirium; however, multicomponent, nonpharmacologic interventions that manage many of the modifiable risk factors appear to reduce the incidence of delirium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104295698\"><span class=\"h2\">Modifying risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of factors have been identified as causing or contributing to delirium in at risk patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-delirium-and-confusional-states\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of delirium and confusional states&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Examples of interventions designed to mitigate risk factors for delirium include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Orientation protocols</strong> - Provision of clocks, calendars, windows with outside views, and verbally re-orienting patients may mitigate confusion that results from disorientation in unfamiliar environments. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cognitive stimulation</strong> - Patients with cognitive impairment, in particular, may benefit from activity such as regular visits from family and friends. At the same time, sensory overstimulation should be avoided, particularly at night.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Facilitation of physiologic sleep </strong>&ndash; Nursing and medical procedures, including the administration of medications, should be avoided during sleeping hours when possible. Night-time noise should be reduced. One randomized trial found that the use of earplugs at night was associated with a lower incidence of confusion in ICU patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Early mobilization and minimized use of physical restraints for patients with limited mobility</strong> - One study in mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients found that early institution of physical and occupational therapy along with consequent interruption in use of sedatives, was a lower rate of hospital days with delirium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Visual and hearing aids for patients with these impairments</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Avoiding <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> monitoring the use of problematic medications</strong> - Medications are often implicated in precipitating delirium, particularly in those already at risk (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F70449\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70449 \">table 1</a>). In one systematic review, the authors concluded that benzodiazepines should be avoided in high risk patients, while caution should be used in prescribing opioids, dihydropyridines, and antihistamines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].<br/><br/>In one large cluster-randomized control study based in nursing homes, implementation of a computerized system to identify the use of problematic medications and trigger a medication review was associated with a lower incidence of delirium (HR = 0.42) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Avoiding and treating medical complications</strong> &ndash; A number of medical conditions are known to cause or aggravate delirium; these should be managed aggressively and prevented where possible.<br/><br/>Some studies have focused specifically on early volume repletion for patients with delirium. While one small study failed to show a benefit for hydration management on the incidence of delirium in a long-term care setting, the small number of patients (98) and short time period of intervention (4 weeks) limited the ability of this study to demonstrate efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].<br/><br/>Hypoxemia and infections are other common complications in high-risk settings and patients. These may contribute to delirium and should be actively monitored for and treated when identified. An interventional program administered via a geriatric consultant team that emphasized avoiding medical complications achieved a one-third reduction in the incidence of delirium among 126 elderly patients undergoing hip surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Managing pain</strong> &ndash; Pain may be a significant risk factor for delirium. The use of nonopioid medications should be used where possible, as these are less likely to aggravate delirium. Clinicians must balance the benefits of using opioids to treat significant pain with the potential for an opioid-related delirium. <br/><br/>Studies in patients undergoing surgery suggest that pre-emptive pain treatment may reduce the incidence of delirium. In one study of 58 older patients, administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> (given as a single dose during induction of anesthesia for cardiac surgery) was associated with a lower rate of postoperative delirium (3 versus 31 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In another study, fascia iliaca compartment block after hip surgery was associated with a reduced incidence of postoperative delirium in intermediate-risk, but not in high-risk patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, making generalized recommendations from such studies is difficult, because of the small sample, inconsistent use of nonpharmacological interventions, and lack of information regarding long-term outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. <br/><br/>Certain classes of opioids are probably best avoided in older patients and others prone to delirium. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meperidine-pethidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Meperidine</a> in particular, has been shown in multiple prospective studies to increase the risk for delirium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. <br/><br/>Cancer patients with terminal delirium and pain may benefit from switching from shorter-acting opioids to long-acting agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Clinicians should also consider the possibility that opioid-induced hyperalgesia may cause breakthrough pain and consider using nonopioid analgesia for pain control. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-management-of-side-effects-in-patients-receiving-opioids-for-chronic-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and management of side effects in patients receiving opioids for chronic pain&quot;</a>.) <br/><br/>Use of nursing protocols to better manage pain has been demonstrated to reduce the severity and duration, but not the incidence, of delirium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p>In one study, a multicomponent intervention used standardized protocols to screen and control for six risk factors for delirium in 852 hospitalized patients aged 70 or older: cognitive impairment, sleep deprivation, immobility, visual impairment, hearing impairment, and dehydration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Interventions such as those listed above were targeted to the identified risk factors. This program resulted in a significant reduction in the number of delirium episodes compared with usual care (62 versus 90) and in the total number of days with delirium (105 versus 161); there was no effect upon delirium severity or the rate of recurrence. The investigators have since reported that community hospitals were able to successfully implement this program when there was a commitment of resources by hospital leadership and appropriate adaptation of protocols to local needs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Subsequent randomized studies have confirmed that such multicomponent interventions can reduce the incidence of delirium <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> related complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104295692\"><span class=\"h2\">Medications to prevent delirium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The available evidence does not support the use of medications to prevent delirium in the acute care or intensive care or postoperative care settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. Investigators continue to study the potential benefit of cholinesterase inhibitors, antipsychotic agents, and others:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rivastigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rivastigmine</a>; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=donepezil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">donepezil</a>) has been proposed as a means to prevent delirium in selected patients and high risk settings (eg, older patients with or without dementia, postoperative and post-stroke settings) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. However, clinical trials have not demonstrated a reduction in the prevalence or incidence of delirium, and side effects have been greater in patients receiving these medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/27-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-31</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antipsychotic agents, given prophylactically and in low dose have been studied in the postoperative setting, and have been associated with inconsistent, and at best, modest benefits in the incidence, severity, and duration of delirium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/32-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-37</a>]. In one of these studies, treatment was associated with increased severity and longer duration of delirium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. A 2013 systematic review and meta-analysis of six studies concluded that such treatment reduced the incidence of delirium, but not the severity or duration; nor were the incidence of associated adverse events reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In this analysis, second-generation antipsychotics appeared to be more beneficial compared to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Gabapentin</a>, in pilot study, reduced the incidence of postoperative delirium, perhaps by reducing pain and opioid administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Melatonin shows promise in the prevention of delirium. The melatonin agonist, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ramelteon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ramelteon</a>, was studied in a randomized trial of 67 older inpatients with serious medical illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Compared to placebo, ramelteon 8 mg was associated with a lower risk of delirium (3 versus 32 percent) despite its lack of effect on sleep parameters. In another randomized study, administration of low dose melatonin (0.5 mg) in 145 older inpatients was associated with a lower incidence of delirium; long-term outcomes were not assessed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Finally, in a randomized trial of 222 patients undergoing hip surgery, preoperative administration of melatonin was associated with a reduced incidence of postoperative delirium (9 versus 33 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Analgesics to control pain may reduce the incidence or severity of delirium, as discussed in the section above.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H354892619\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principles underlying the management of delirium are summarized in the Algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59337\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef59337 \">algorithm 1</a>). The algorithm includes two pathways that are followed simultaneously: one to manage the behavior disturbance; and another to find and treat the underlying medical disorder. An important caveat is that the symptoms of delirium can have a prolonged duration extending many weeks into the post-acute period, after the underlying causes and risk factors have been corrected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of underlying conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Virtually any medical condition can precipitate delirium in a susceptible patient; multiple underlying conditions are often found [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. When the underlying acute illness responsible for delirium is identified, specific therapy is directed toward the medical condition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-adults#H11068750\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute toxic-metabolic encephalopathy in adults&quot;, section on 'Specific etiologies'</a>.)</p><p>The conditions noted most commonly in prospective studies of delirium include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metabolic encephalopathy &ndash; These include the following which are discussed in detail separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-moderate-and-severe-alcohol-withdrawal-syndromes#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of moderate and severe alcohol withdrawal syndromes&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p/><p>While Wernicke encephalopathy is not common, many older hospitalized patients have biochemical evidence of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thiamine</a> deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In addition, chronic alcoholism is often difficult to detect in this population, and symptoms of persistent alcoholic delirium may be difficult to distinguish from those of Wernicke encephalopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Thiamine supplementation is inexpensive and virtually risk-free; it should be provided to all hospitalized patients with evidence of nutritional deficiency.

Unfortunately, there are few controlled studies. One study found that early identification and comprehensive geriatric consultation for patients with established delirium had little impact on length of stay, functional outcome, or survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]; another found that multicomponent interventions shortened the duration of delirium but had no impact on mortality or nursing home use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Stronger evidence supports the use of these interdisciplinary efforts for prevention of delirium. (See <a href=\"#H104295698\" class=\"local\">'Modifying risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p>Nonetheless, an interdisciplinary approach to delirium should focus upon maintaining adequate hydration and nutrition, enhancing mobility and range of motion, treating pain and discomfort, preventing skin breakdown, ameliorating incontinence (seen in over half of delirious patients), and minimizing the risk of aspiration pneumonitis. <br/><br/>This team approach should also include family or other caregivers who may feel frightened or exhausted; delirium can be the &quot;last straw&quot; for those who have been caring for the demented. Caregiver resources must be realistically assessed.</p><p>Because delirium may require weeks or months to fully resolve, management often extends into subacute settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. Transfers of care to new settings are periods of particular vulnerability for older patients, and it is important to effectively communicate information about mental status to the accepting treatment team [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104295711\"><span class=\"h2\">Managing agitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Managing disruptive behavior, particularly agitation and combative behavior, is a challenging aspect of delirium therapy. This hyperactive delirium is less common in older patients, and when it occurs, alternates with periods of hypoactive delirium, which may be less obvious to the clinical staff [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Periods of disruptive and hyperactive behavior place the patient at risk for falls, wandering off, or inadvertently removing intravenous lines and feeding tubes.</p><p>When delirium is manifest by agitation, symptom control is occasionally necessary to prevent harm or to allow evaluation and treatment. While nonpharmacologic interventions should be the mainstay of treatment, a cautious trial of psychotropic medication is warranted in these circumstances. Unfortunately, there are limited data to guide treatment as the available studies have significant methodologic limitations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Nonpharmacologic interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mild confusion and agitation may respond to interpersonal and environmental manipulations. The hospital environment, characterized by high ambient noise, poor lighting, lack of windows, frequent room changes, and restraint use, often contributes to worsening confusion. Special units that address these concerns have improved the functional outcomes of hospitalization in such frail patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Frequent reassurance, touch, and verbal orientation can lessen disruptive behaviors; family members or other familiar persons are preferred, but professional sitters can also be used to effect. Delusions and hallucinations should be neither endorsed nor challenged. Other specific interventions are discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H104295698\" class=\"local\">'Modifying risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p>Physical restraints should be used only as a last resort, if at all, as they frequently increase agitation and create additional problems, such as loss of mobility, pressure ulcers, aspiration, and prolonged delirium. In one study, restraint-use among patients in a medical inpatient unit was associated with a three-fold increased odds of persistent delirium at time of hospital discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

As described above, treatment did not reduce the incidence of delirium, but did reduce the severity and duration of episodes.

However, it is important to document the assessment of cognitive abilities and decision-making capacity. Current practice leaves considerable room for improvement. As an example, in a prospective study of 173 medical and surgical procedures performed in patients with delirium at a university hospital, investigators found no documented assessments of competency or decision capacity, and cognitive assessments in only 4 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>].
