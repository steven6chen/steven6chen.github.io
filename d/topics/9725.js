The most common techniques prevent pregnancy by disrupting the patency of the fallopian tubes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-female-sterilization/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This prevents conception by blocking transport of sperm from the lower genital tract to an ovulated oocyte.</p><p>Female sterilization may be performed immediately after childbirth (postpartum sterilization) or at a time unrelated to a pregnancy (interval sterilization). Most postpartum sterilization procedures are performed at time of cesarean delivery or after a vaginal delivery via mini-laparotomy. Most interval sterilization procedures are performed via laparoscopy.</p><p>This topic review will focus on female laparoscopic sterilization.

General principles of laparoscopy are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-laparoscopic-and-abdominal-robotic-surgery-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for laparoscopic and abdominal robotic surgery in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nerve-injury-associated-with-pelvic-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nerve injury associated with pelvic surgery&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-access-techniques-used-in-laparoscopic-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal access techniques used in laparoscopic surgery&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=instruments-and-devices-used-in-laparoscopic-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Instruments and devices used in laparoscopic surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A common approach is to use two laparoscopic ports: an umbilical port for the laparoscope and a midline suprapubic port for the other instruments. In some cases, one or two additional 5 mm ports are required to safely and effectively complete the procedure.</p><p>Some surgeons prefer to do the procedure through a single incision. Traditionally, this was done through a first generation operating laparoscope that had a channel for the camera and another for instruments. However, this technique is limited by inability to apply traction and optimal positioning of an occlusive device. There has been more advanced development of single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS), which has allowed performance of many surgical procedures through a single port. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-access-techniques-used-in-laparoscopic-surgery#H376701701\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal access techniques used in laparoscopic surgery&quot;, section on 'Single-incision surgery (SIS)'</a>.)</p><p>For laparoscopic sterilization, however, single incision techniques likely offer minimal advantages. Multiple incision laparoscopic sterilization can be accomplished with two to three using small (5 mm) incisions and with instrumentation that is readily available in most operating room settings in the United States. Placement of a uterine manipulator can improve the ability to achieve optimal positioning and grasping of the fallopian tube. We routinely use a 5 mm port at the umbilicus for placing the laparoscope; a potential disadvantage of use of the operating laparoscope or the SILS technique is that both require a larger umbilical incision.</p><p>There are no comparative data regarding the efficacy or complications rates associated tubal ligation performed with multiple or single laparoscopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1343077556\"><span class=\"h2\">Identification of the tubes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An essential step, regardless of approach, is the correct identification of the fallopian tubes, which may be more difficult in the setting of prior pelvic surgery, endometriosis, or uterine anomalies. Once identified, the tube should be confirmed as the correct structure by examining the tubes bilaterally along their full length to visualize the fimbriated end. This also helps to prevent failure of the intended sterilization and avoid surgical interruption of other structures (eg, round ligaments).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102175684\"><span class=\"h2\">Tubal occlusion techniques</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H61166674\"><span class=\"h3\">Choosing a technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several methods of tubal occlusion or excision for laparoscopic female sterilization: electrosurgical desiccation, mechanical methods (silicone band, titanium clip, or spring clip), and partial or complete salpingectomy.</p><p>Effective tubal occlusion, desiccation, or excision should be performed on the mid-isthmic portion of the tube (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F55921\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55921 \">figure 1</a>), regardless of the specific sterilization technique. The proximal isthmus (immediately adjacent to the cornua) should be avoided to reduce the theoretical risk of fistula formation between the interstitial portion of the tube and the peritoneal cavity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-female-sterilization/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Surgery for sterilization performed on the distal portion of the tube may increase risk of injuring adjacent structures, and distal fimbriectomy has been associated with higher risk of sterilization failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-female-sterilization/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The most common methods of tubal occlusion in current practice are electrosurgical desiccation with the Kleppinger bipolar grasping forceps, silicone band, or titanium clip. Based upon data from the original Collaborative Review of Sterilization (CREST) study, subsequent follow-up estimates of the bipolar method, as well as studies of the titanium clip, all methods are comparably safe and effective, with complication and failure rates of &lt;1 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F54215\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54215 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-female-sterilization/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>] (see <a href=\"#H102176299\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1732916946\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> below). Thus, choice of technique for occlusion should be guided by the experience of the surgeon, available equipment, technical ease, and cost. </p><p>In our practice, we use bipolar desiccation with a blended cutting and coagulation energy pattern (the red &quot;Wolf&quot; generator creates a blend of cutting and coagulation) with Kleppinger forceps. This method is technically easy and is locally available to us. Compared with mechanical methods for tubal occlusion, electrosurgery employs reusable, and therefore lower cost, instrumentation. Bipolar electrosurgery is associated with less postprocedural pain compared with silicone bands, but may have greater risk of ectopic pregnancy. If a mechanical method is chosen, the titanium clip appears to be associated with lower risk of mesosalpingeal injury than silicone bands. (See <a href=\"#H102176299\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p>As a reason for selection of a tubal occlusion technique, we do <strong>not</strong> consider the potential for improved reversibility with techniques that minimize tubal damage (eg, from clips or band). Tubal sterilization is intended to be a permanent procedure, and women should be told this without exception as part of the consent process. Women interested in potential reversibility should be counseled to avoid sterilization and instead consider long-acting reversible contraceptives (intrauterine devices or the implant) given the comparable efficacy of these options compared with sterilization. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-female-sterilization#H874577706\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of female sterilization&quot;, section on 'Sterilization versus other contraceptives'</a>.)</p><p>Salpingectomy has not traditionally been the method of choice for laparoscopic sterilization, since electrosurgical and mechanical techniques are technically easier. There is increased interest in complete salpingectomy based on a potential reduction in ovarian cancer risk. We also routinely offer bilateral salpingectomy to patients seeking tubal sterilization and counsel patients about the potential benefits and risks. (See <a href=\"#H1311210395\" class=\"local\">'Salpingectomy'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7757986\"><span class=\"h3\">Electrosurgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiofrequency energy is employed to desiccate the fallopian tubes and the adjacent mesosalpinx, resulting in occlusion by <span class=\"nowrap\">destruction/obliteration</span> of the tubal lumen. </p><p>Typically, the Kleppinger bipolar electrosurgical grasping forceps are used for tubal fulguration. Use of other electrosurgical methods, such as an ultrasonic or vessel-sealing device, has not been described in the literature as an effective method of sterilization. </p><p>To perform the procedure, the surgeon grasps the full thickness of the tube between the two prongs of the Kleppinger forceps and then activates the electrical generator (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F101237\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101237 \">figure 2</a>). This is then repeated for contiguous segments of tube at a minimum of three sites.</p><p>The steps used to ensure that the tube is adequately occluded when using bipolar electrosurgery with the Kleppinger forceps are the following: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A segment of <strong>at least 3 cm</strong> of the tube should be fulgurated. This recommendation is based on a reanalysis of failures following bipolar electrosurgery for sterilization in the CREST cohort. When electrosurgery was applied to three contiguous sites on the fallopian tube (a total length of fulguration of approximately 3 cm) the failure rate of the bipolar electrosurgery technique approached the lowest reported range for laparoscopic sterilization (3.2 per 1000 procedures); in comparison, if fewer than three sites of electrosurgery were applied, the probability of failure was 12.9 per 1000 procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-female-sterilization/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A visual appearance of &quot;blanching&quot; (tube turns white) of tubal tissue is not sufficient to conclude the tube is adequately occluded. As an example, in one study of bipolar electrosurgical sterilization in women immediately prior to hysterectomy, histologic evidence of desiccation was found consistently with use of an undamped waveform (traditionally referred to as a cutting waveform) and a power of at least 25 watts. With a damped (coagulation) waveform, complete desiccation was found only with much higher settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-female-sterilization/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The current electrosurgical unit offered by the manufacturer of the Kleppinger forceps produces a primarily undamped waveform [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-female-sterilization/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The surgeon and operating room staff must make sure that the correct electrosurgical generator is connected to the Kleppinger bipolar grasping forceps to minimize risk of ineffective tubal desiccation. In addition, an optical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> audible inline current meter should be used by the operator to determine the end point. The meter allows application of radiofrequency energy until there is no further resistance from viable tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-female-sterilization/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p/><p>Historically, monopolar electrosurgery was used when laparoscopic sterilization was first introduced. We recommend <strong>NOT</strong> using monopolar electrosurgery for tubal sterilization due to the risk of thermal injury. Inadvertent thermal burn to structures including the bowel has been described in case reports and small case series with monopolar devices for sterilization; several cases of death due to resulting sepsis have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-female-sterilization/abstract/2,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9-11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7757992\"><span class=\"h3\">Mechanical methods</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7758000\"><span class=\"h4\">Silicone band</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Placement of a silicone band (Falope-Ring) around a folded loop of fallopian tube was developed by Yoon and colleagues in the early 1970s as a safer and effective alternative to monopolar electrosurgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-female-sterilization/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>The band is made of a nonreactive silicone rubber that incorporates a solution of 5 percent barium sulfate to permit radiologic identification. The band is 2.2 mm thick with an outer diameter of 3.6 mm and an inner diameter of 1 mm. It possesses a specific elastic power with a recovery of 90 to 100 percent, if not stretched to more than 7 mm.</p><p>The band is placed using a special applicator. The silicone band is stretched over the end of the applicator immediately prior to device insertion through the laparoscopic port. The applicator has prongs within the sheath, which are carefully advanced, and used to gently grasp the isthmic portion of the fallopian tube (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F62868\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62868 \">figure 3</a>). The prongs are retracted, elevating the tube into the sheath of the applicator. The band is then deployed, placing it at the base of a loop of tube that is 1.5 to 2 cm in length (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78095\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78095 \">figure 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F58138\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58138 \">figure 5</a>). The tube must be grasped and elevated carefully to avoid laceration to the tube <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mesosalpinx. With time, the loop of tube will necrose and result in interruption of tubal patency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7758006\"><span class=\"h4\">Titanium clip or spring clip</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two clips are available for tubal sterilization in the United States: the titanium clip (Filshie clip) and the spring clip (Hulka clip). </p><p>The titanium clip appears to be more effective than the spring clip. A randomized trial that included 599 women who underwent laparoscopic sterilization with a clip and had long-term follow-up found that the failure rate was significantly lower at 24 months with the titanium compared with the spring clip (9.7 versus 28.1 pregnancies per 1000 women) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-female-sterilization/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Also, in the CREST study, the spring clip was the least effective method, but this study did not include the titanium clip [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-female-sterilization/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1732916946\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> below.)</p><p>Both types of clips are placed using specially-designed reusable applicators. The clip is attached to the applicator outside the patient. The clip is partially closed as it is advanced through the laparoscopic port, and then advanced toward the fallopian tube in an open position to facilitate light grasping and positioning. The clip is applied perpendicular to the isthmic portion of the tube and advanced until the distal end is across the tubal lumen; it is then closed. Correct placement is essential to ensure complete occlusion. Clips are left permanently in place and become peritonealized as the tube necroses and heals. </p><p>Individual characteristics of each clip include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The <strong>titanium clip</strong> is composed of a titanium outer sheath lined by a silicone pad (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F101888\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101888 \">picture 1</a>). The reusable titanium clip applicator requires a 7 mm trocar for placement, with a 5 mm option available for single incision laparoscopic surgery. Once the lower jaw of the clip is visible through the mesosalpinx just below the tube, the applicator handle is slowly but firmly squeezed to secure the clip in place (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F101890\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101890 \">figure 6</a>). Once closed, a clip cannot be opened. If a clip is placed incorrectly, a second clip may be placed on the same tube, as close as possible to the first clip to minimize risk of hydrosalpinx formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-female-sterilization/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There is no magnetic component of the titanium clip; therefore, it should be compatible with subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The <strong>spring clip</strong> has toothed jaws of polycarbonate (Lexan) with a stainless steel fulcrum and gold-plated spring-loaded mechanism to lock the clip in place (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F50616\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50616 \">picture 2</a>). The spring clip applicator requires access although a 7 mm port and allows the operator to open and close the clip to confirm correct placement before locking (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F63446\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63446 \">figure 7</a>). Once applied, the spring clip is designed to gradually apply pressure over 24 to 48 hours to occlude a 3 to 5 mm segment of the fallopian tube [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-female-sterilization/abstract/2,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,15</a>]. Application of spring clips may be difficult if the tubes are edematous. The manufacturer confirms that there is also no know adverse effect of MRI exposure for women with the Hulka clip [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-female-sterilization/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p>For the methods described above using a band or clip to occlude the tube, abnormal tubal anatomy (for example, dilated tubes from prior infection) will interfere with correct and effective placement of the occlusive device. These methods should not be used for women with known tubal disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1311210395\"><span class=\"h3\">Salpingectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Partial or complete salpingectomy has not traditionally been the method of choice for laparoscopic sterilization, since electrosurgical and mechanical techniques are technically easier and may be associated with a lower risk of complications (eg, bleeding). A large observational study of 14,886 patients in British Columbia compared completed salpingectomy for sterilization with other methods of interval sterilization and found no increase in complication rates and an increase in operative time of approximately 10 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-female-sterilization/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Similarly, a case series of 81 salpingectomies and 68 tubal occlusions performed using the ring (19.1 percent), bipolar electrosurgery (32.4 percent), or titanium clip (47.1 percent) showed comparable immediate and short-term complications rates across sterilization methods and an average increase of 6 minutes of operative time for salpingectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-female-sterilization/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. One caveat regarding salpingectomy is that it may not be technically feasible or may have an increased risk of complications is women with significant pelvic adhesions, endometriosis, or abnormal anatomy. In terms of efficacy, removal of the entire fallopian tube bilaterally theoretically increases the effectiveness, and reduces the risk of needing subsequent surgery for ectopic pregnancy or hydrosalpinx [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-female-sterilization/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>There is increased interest in complete salpingectomy based on a potential reduction in ovarian cancer risk. The rationale for this approach and technique for laparoscopic salpingectomy are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=opportunistic-salpingectomy-for-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-carcinoma-risk-reduction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Opportunistic salpingectomy for ovarian, fallopian tubal, and peritoneal carcinoma risk reduction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In our practice, we routinely discuss the option of complete salpingectomy with patient and review the potential benefits and risks as part of the informed consent process. We review the theoretical reduction in risk of ovarian cancer, potential for decreased future morbidity, and minimal increased risk or surgical complications or additional time for the procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102177233\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postoperatively, patients are instructed to avoid intercourse for three weeks, though this is based on consensus rather than evidence. </p><p>The laparoscopic sterilization procedure is immediately effective, so other methods of contraception can be discontinued. </p><p>Most patients should be able to return to work after one week unless they have particularly strenuous job requirements. We see patients for a postoperative clinic visit within two to four weeks after their operation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102176299\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications specifically associated with laparoscopic sterilization are discussed here; general complications of laparoscopic surgery are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of laparoscopic surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Analysis of interval laparoscopic procedures in the United States Collaborative Review of Sterilization (CREST) cohort concluded that the overall rate of intraoperative and postoperative complications was 1.<span class=\"nowrap\">6/100</span> women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-female-sterilization/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. When major surgeries that were not related to laparoscopic sterilization procedures were excluded, the rate was reduced to 0.<span class=\"nowrap\">9/100</span> women. There were no deaths and only one report of a life-threatening event among 9475 procedures. </p><p>Complications rates among the four most commonly referenced methods of laparoscopic tubal sterilization (silicone band, spring clip, bipolar or monopolar electrosurgery) ranged from 1.17 to 1.95 per 100 procedures in the CREST population. There was no statistically significant difference in complication rates between these techniques. Patient history of diabetes, general anesthesia, and previous abdominal or pelvic surgery were all found to be predictors of increased morbidity related to interval tubal sterilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-female-sterilization/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. There have not been any studies since CREST with a denominator large enough to rigorously compare complication rates between the more common modern methods of laparoscopic sterilization. A meta-analysis of 19 randomized trials demonstrated that the silicone band compared with the titanium clip had a higher rate of minor procedure-related injuries with no additional operation (4.6 versus 2.4 percent, odds ratio [OR] 1.95, 95% CI 1.36-2.78) and technical failures (3.3 versus 0.7 percent, OR 3.93, 95% CI 2.43-6.35) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-female-sterilization/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Another observational study, of 44,278 procedures in New York State between 2005 and 2013 reported the rate of iatrogenic complications (hemorrhage or hematoma complicating a procedure, and accidental puncture or laceration) to be 0.4 percent within 30 days following laparoscopic sterilization. The rate of major medical complications (acute myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism, perioperative shock, and respiratory complications) was reported to be 0.1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-female-sterilization/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Both of these studies confirm that, overall, laparoscopic sterilization is a very safe technique.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1311211686\"><span class=\"h2\">Immediate complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immediate complications from surgical sterilization may include bleeding, injury to other structures, or pain. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1311211645\"><span class=\"h3\">Bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bleeding may occur from the tube or mesosalpinx due to excessive traction during surgery or from trauma during placement of occlusive devices. In such cases, bleeding may be controlled with bipolar electrosurgery or with application of additional silicone bands or clips. Tubal transection may occur if a clip is placed too quickly; slow gradual pressure is advised to &quot;milk away&quot; any tubal edema present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-female-sterilization/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Some surgeons report that in their practice there is less risk of transecting the tube and related bleeding complications during application of the clip compared with the silicone band [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-female-sterilization/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A randomized trial using the titanium clip compared with the silicone band reported tubal or mesosalpingeal injury in <span class=\"nowrap\">2/904</span> (0.2 percent) of laparoscopic clip procedures, compared with <span class=\"nowrap\">23/880</span> (2.5 percent) of the silicone band procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-female-sterilization/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1311211662\"><span class=\"h3\">Injury to nearby structures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If salpingectomy is performed for sterilization, care should be taken to avoid excessive electrosurgery of the infundibulopelvic ligament. Identification of the infundibulopelvic ligament is crucial to avoid compromising ovarian blood flow, and if the vessels are divided without sufficient, care significant bleeding can result. Venous structures in the mesosalpinx are another potential source of bleeding if the tube is grasped with excessive force or manipulated with a laparoscopic grasper that has teeth or sharp components, including the silicone band applicator.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1659814742\"><span class=\"h3\">Conversion to laparotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the CREST study, conversion from laparoscopy to laparotomy to complete the sterilization procedure due to complications specific to laparoscopic technique (such as injury to other structures at time of entry) occurred in only 14 out of 9475 procedures (0.15 percent). Nine laparotomies were performed for findings of incidental disease, 37 due to difficult visualization or mobilization of the fallopian tubes, four for equipment malfunction, three for unknown reasons, and 21 for women in whom entry or pneumoperitoneum could not be obtained, for a total laparotomy rate of 0.09 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-female-sterilization/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The risk of conversion to laparotomy in current practice is likely to be even lower, given improvements in laparoscopic skill and technique since the CREST study was conducted. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1311211651\"><span class=\"h3\">Postoperative pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Short-term postoperative pain is expected following laparoscopic gynecologic surgery due to the abdominal incisions and to diaphragmatic irritation from residual intraperitoneal carbon dioxide, as occurs after other laparoscopic surgeries. Most surgeons prescribe a limited number of oral narcotics to use for postoperative pain not controlled by the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> during the first one to five days. For most women, any severe pain is resolved by the third postoperative day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-female-sterilization/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The silicone band and clips appears to cause more postoperative pain than electrosurgery. This is likely because both these methods result in ischemic tubal tissue. Two studies included in a meta-analysis of randomized trials of methods for tubal sterilization compared postoperative pain (&lt;24 hours) among women undergoing laparoscopic sterilization via silicone band or electrosurgery. The combined analysis showed significantly more pain with silicone bands as compared with electrosurgery (odds ratio [OR] 3.40 [1.17 to 9.84]) as well as higher postoperative analgesia use (OR 2.51 [1.00 to 6.30]). There was no difference in persistent pain at the follow-up visit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-female-sterilization/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Data are conflicting regarding whether the clip or silicone band is more painful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-female-sterilization/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. &#160;</p><p>In randomized trials, use of a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a> at time of laparoscopic sterilization with silicone bands or titanium clips has been found to decrease postoperative pain scores compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-female-sterilization/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Using a cannula placed through a lower port site, the surgeon can drip 5 mL of 0.5 percent bupivacaine along the tube from the uterus to the fimbria bilaterally prior to tubal occlusion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1399037293\"><span class=\"h2\">Delayed complications</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1311211680\"><span class=\"h3\">Ectopic pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ectopic pregnancy is the most serious delayed complication, since unrecognized tubal rupture remains a significant contributor to maternal mortality in early pregnancy. Overall, ectopic pregnancies accounted for 32.9 percent of all pregnancies reported in CREST subjects, for an ectopic pregnancy rate of 7.3 per 1000 sterilization procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-female-sterilization/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Women under age 30 years at time of sterilization had higher rates of ectopic pregnancy compared with older women, except for those under 30 years sterilized by postpartum partial salpingectomy. The risk of ectopic pregnancy did not significantly vary with length of time since sterilization.</p><p>In the original CREST study, bipolar electrosurgery resulted in the highest probability of ectopic pregnancy (17.1 per 1000 procedures at 10 years after sterilization), postpartum partial salpingectomy the lowest (1.5 per 1000 procedures at 10 years after sterilization) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-female-sterilization/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The rate of ectopic pregnancy is likely much lower using modern techniques, since re-analysis of the CREST data suggests that applying bipolar electrosurgery to three adjacent sites on the tube dramatically decreases the cumulative pregnancy rate to 3.<span class=\"nowrap\">2/1000</span> procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-female-sterilization/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Differences in probability varied by age (highest for younger women) and by method, though they disclose that 40 of the 89 women with ectopic pregnancy had a laparoscopic sterilization by an unspecified method of destruction or occlusion. Bipolar electrosurgery by laparoscopy had a reported risk of ectopic pregnancy of 8.<span class=\"nowrap\">4/1000</span> procedures at five and 10 years after surgery. Following laparoscopic occlusion with the titanium clip, the probability of ectopic pregnancy was only 1.<span class=\"nowrap\">7/1000</span> procedures at five years and 2.<span class=\"nowrap\">0/1000</span> at 10 years after sterilization.

This study, like CREST, included both interval and postpartum sterilizations, but was not able to analyze failures according to sterilization method. The authors hypothesized that their lower rate of sterilization failure might be due to (1) minimal use of the Hulka clip in Canada, which had the highest failure rate and was responsible for 15 percent of sterilization failures in CREST, and (2) sterilizations done in all hospital settings in Quebec, not just in teaching hospitals as was the case in CREST [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-female-sterilization/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Laparoscopic techniques are the most common approach to interval female sterilization (procedures that are not performed during the postpartum period). (See <a href=\"#H7757824\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The only indication for sterilization is the patient's desire for permanent contraception. There are no medical conditions that are strictly incompatible with laparoscopic sterilization; however, there may be factors that make women more suitable for a particular route of sterilization or other contraceptive options. (See <a href=\"#H1311209885\" class=\"local\">'Indications and contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preoperative evaluation and preparation for sterilization includes: counseling about alternatives to sterilization, types of sterilization procedures, efficacy and permanence of sterilization, and risk factors for regret; assessment of surgical risk; and pregnancy testing. (See <a href=\"#H1311209891\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative evaluation and preparation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Effective sterilization methods are performed on the mid-isthmic portion of the tube (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F55921\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55921 \">figure 1</a>). The proximal isthmus (immediately adjacent to the cornua) should be avoided to reduce the theoretical risk of fistula formation between the interstitial portion of the tube and the peritoneal cavity. (See <a href=\"#H61166674\" class=\"local\">'Choosing a technique'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are several methods of tubal occlusion or excision for laparoscopic female sterilization: electrosurgical desiccation, mechanical methods (silicone band, titanium clip, or spring clip), and partial or complete salpingectomy. The most common methods in current practice are electrosurgery or the band or clip; these all have comparable efficacy and safety. (See <a href=\"#H61166674\" class=\"local\">'Choosing a technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Choice of technique for tubal occlusion should be guided by the experience of the surgeon and the equipment available. In our practice, we use bipolar electrosurgical desiccation with Kleppinger forceps. Compared with the band or clip, bipolar desiccation may be technically easier. Bipolar electrosurgical desiccation is associated with less postprocedural pain compared with silicone bands. However, there is concern that bipolar electrosurgery may increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy compared with other techniques, and for this reason, the titanium clip is preferred by some experts. The titanium clip appears to be associated with lower risk of mesosalpingeal injury than silicone bands. (See <a href=\"#H61166674\" class=\"local\">'Choosing a technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women undergoing interval laparoscopic sterilization using the Kleppinger bipolar grasping forceps, we recommend that the tube be fulgurated along a 3 cm contiguous segment rather than separate areas of fulguration or a smaller segment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). A cutting waveform and a power of at least 25 watts is used to optimize desiccation and occlusion of the fallopian tube. For women undergoing sterilization using electrosurgery, we recommend <strong>NOT</strong> using monopolar electrosurgery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7757986\" class=\"local\">'Electrosurgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In our practice, we routinely offer the option of complete salpingectomy with patient and review the potential benefits and risks as part of the informed consent process. Salpingectomy has not traditionally been the method of choice for laparoscopic sterilization, since electrosurgical and mechanical techniques are technically easier. Data suggest that salpingectomy does not increase the risk of complications compared with other sterilization techniques. There is increased interest in complete salpingectomy based on a potential reduction in ovarian cancer risk. (See <a href=\"#H1311210395\" class=\"local\">'Salpingectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Observational studies report that interval laparoscopic sterilization is a very safe technique, with risk of major complications of &lt;1 percent. The most concerning delayed complication is the risk of ectopic pregnancy, which is reported to occur in 3 to 7 per 1000 women. Complication rates are similar across the different tubal occlusion techniques. (See <a href=\"#H102176299\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laparoscopic sterilization is immediately effective, so other methods of contraception can be discontinued. The risk of post-sterilization pregnancy varies by the technique used for interval laparoscopic sterilization, though studies confirm a failure rate of &lt;1 percent across all currently used techniques. The differences in efficacy between methods of sterilization diminished with increasing age at sterilization, with no statistical differences in 10-year efficacy rates between methods among women 34 years or older at the time of sterilization. (See <a href=\"#H1732916946\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4137583413\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Thomas Stovall, MD and William Mann, Jr, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-female-sterilization/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Moss C, Isley MM.
