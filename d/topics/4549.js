In addition, patients with angina refractory to medical therapy may receive a recommendation for CABG if PCI cannot be performed. The procedure involves the construction of one or more grafts between the arterial and coronary circulations. Most patients receive both arterial and venous grafts during CABG and long-term graft patency is significantly better with the former. Potential consequences of graft failure (loss of patency) include the development of angina, myocardial infarction, or cardiac death.</p><p>This topic will briefly discuss the causes of graft failure and rates of patency for the various coronary bypass grafts.

However, unlike arterial grafts, failure rates are high, perhaps up to 25 percent in the first 12 to 18 months (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61140\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef61140 \">movie 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-causes-and-rates-of-graft-failure/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. </p><p>Saphenous vein graft (SVG)&nbsp;patency is greatly dependent on the distal runoff of the coronary artery bypassed; distal runoff is largely determined by the size of the native coronary artery. The left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) is the largest coronary artery and therefore patency rates are much better even when a vein is used. The clinical consequences of SVG stenosis are presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-prevention-and-management-of-vein-graft-stenosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coronary artery bypass graft surgery: Prevention and management of vein graft stenosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-long-term-clinical-outcomes#H14980250\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coronary artery bypass graft surgery: Long-term clinical outcomes&quot;, section on 'Predictors of mortality'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Early occlusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SVG occlusion occurs within 30 days of coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) in approximately 10 percent of grafts. This complication is usually due to technical failure (such as kinks from excessive length of the graft), conduit characteristics (such as a diameter &lt;1.5 mm or prior vein pathology), or poor distal runoff [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-causes-and-rates-of-graft-failure/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Each of these may contribute to stasis within the graft leading to thrombosis. Hypercoagulability, if present, may also contribute.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Occlusion within the first 12 to 18 months</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Much of the data regarding the rates and causes of vein graft failure have come from studies reported decades ago. As there have been significant improvements in both surgical technique and medical therapy for the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, the results from these older studies may not accurately reflect the results from other procedures. </p><p>In 2014, the rates and causes of vein graft failure were evaluated in a post-hoc, retrospective analysis of the more contemporary PREVENT IV trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-causes-and-rates-of-graft-failure/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-long-term-clinical-outcomes#H14980586\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coronary artery bypass graft surgery: Long-term clinical outcomes&quot;, section on 'Vein graft failure'</a>.). In this study, 1828 patients (100 centers) from the trial underwent either protocol mandated follow-up angiography at 12 to 18 months or angiography for a clinical indication. Vein graft failure was defined as a &ge;75 percent stenosis or occlusion. Vein graft failure was seen in about 43 percent of patients and about 25 percent of vein grafts had failed. After multivariable adjustment, the following factors predicted failure: longer surgical duration, endoscopic vein harvesting, poor target artery quality, and postoperative use of a platelet P2Y<sub>12 </sub>receptor blocker. Among the patients with VGF, only 7.1 percent were identified by early repeat angiography for clinical symptoms, meaning VGF is silent in the majority of patients. </p><p>The pathophysiology of SVG failure during 12 to 18 months includes platelet aggregation, growth factor secretion, endothelial dysfunction due to reduced endothelial production of nitric oxide and prostacyclin, decreased local fibrinolytic potential resulting from upregulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, inflammation, luminal foam cell accumulation, and marked intimal hyperplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-causes-and-rates-of-graft-failure/abstract/7-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-13</a>]. Damage to the vein graft at the time of transplantation is postulated as an initiator of these changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-causes-and-rates-of-graft-failure/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>An important modulator of these events is thrombin, and functional thrombin receptors have been demonstrated on the endothelium and smooth muscle cells of the internal thoracic artery (ITA) and saphenous vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-causes-and-rates-of-graft-failure/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. While these receptors mediate vasodilation in the ITA, they result in contraction and smooth muscle cell proliferation in the saphenous vein.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Late occlusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Late occlusion sometime after the first 12 to 18 months occurs when the areas of intimal hyperplasia develop lipid deposition and finally an atherosclerotic-like plaque [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-causes-and-rates-of-graft-failure/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. From the end of year one to year six, SVGs obstruct at the rate of approximately 2 percent per year; the subsequent closure rate rises to 4 to 5 percent per year. </p><p>The predictors of late occlusion have been evaluated in several studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-causes-and-rates-of-graft-failure/abstract/13,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15-17</a>]. The following are representative:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 266 patients with 656 grafts that were patent 7 to 10 days after surgery, the only factors that were predictive of graft patency at three years were vein preservation solution temperature &le;5&ordm;C, serum cholesterol, the number of proximal anastomoses (&le;2), and recipient artery diameter &gt;5 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-causes-and-rates-of-graft-failure/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Thus, predictors of three-year graft patency are most closely related to operative techniques and the underlying disease. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 1248 patients (who underwent angiography at baseline 1 to 11 years after CABG and 4.3 years later), factors independently associated with the progression of disease, in order of importance, were: maximal stenosis of the graft at baseline angiography; time after CABG; prior myocardial infarction; elevated triglyceride levels; small minimum graft diameter; low high density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentration; high low density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentration; elevated mean arterial pressure; reduced left ventricular ejection fraction; male sex; and current cigarette smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-causes-and-rates-of-graft-failure/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The role of diabetes is less clear. In a report from the BARI trial, the presence of diabetes did not appear to affect the patency of SVGs at four years even though diabetic patients had smaller distal vessels and vessels of poorer quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-causes-and-rates-of-graft-failure/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

These concerns are based on a greater likelihood of technical failure and their more frequent use with poor distal coronary targets. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Early occlusion'</a> above.)</p><p>The issue of whether long-term outcomes differ with single or multiple distal anastomoses was evaluated in a post-hoc, substudy of the PREVENT IV trial, which randomly assigned 3014 patients undergoing first CABG with at least two planned SVGs to either a novel agent used to prevent neointimal hyperplasia or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-causes-and-rates-of-graft-failure/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The use of SVG conduits with multiple distal anastomoses was associated with a significantly higher rate of SVG failure (defined as a &ge;75 percent angiographic stenosis) at one year (adjusted odds ratio 1.24, 95% CI 1.03-1.48) and a trend toward a higher rate of the adjusted composite of death, MI, or revascularization at five years (hazard ratio 1.15, 95% CI 1.00-1.31). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15134962\"><span class=\"h1\">ARTERIAL GRAFTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patency rates for arterial grafts at 10 years are as high as 98 percent and arterial graft patency is associated with long-term survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-causes-and-rates-of-graft-failure/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. As this high rate far exceeds that for vein grafts, an attempt is made to place at least one arterial graft in every patient who undergoes coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-long-term-clinical-outcomes#H14980256\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coronary artery bypass graft surgery: Long-term clinical outcomes&quot;, section on 'Use of the left internal thoracic artery'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H672037\"><span class=\"h2\">Single arterial graft</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When one arterial graft is placed, it is usually the left internal thoracic artery (ITA), which is also referred to as the internal mammary artery. The preference for the left ITA, compared to the right ITA or another arterial graft, is due to the broad experience with it and the relative ease with which it can be used. The left ITA is usually anastomosed to the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD).</p><p>The early patency of a left ITA graft was almost 99 percent in a study with a mean follow-up of about 11 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-causes-and-rates-of-graft-failure/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Early patency for a right ITA, when anastomosed to a major branch of the left circumflex artery, is approximately 94 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-causes-and-rates-of-graft-failure/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. There are infrequent cases in which the ITA graft develops a stenosis or becomes occluded within three months of surgery. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Multiple arterial grafts'</a> below.)</p><p>Early arterial failure is related to operative issues (ie, technical harvest problems, distal anastomotic technique, perioperative management, including the variable use and timing of antiplatelet therapy, vasospasm, and statin therapy) and patient-related anatomical issues&nbsp;(proximal stenosis, presence of competitive flow in the bypassed vessel, size of distal vessel, as well as plaquing and diffuse disease in the bypassed vessel).</p><p>Long-term graft patency is much higher with ITA than venous grafts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-causes-and-rates-of-graft-failure/abstract/1,15,25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,15,25-27</a>]. There are a number of anatomic and physiologic differences between saphenous veins and ITAs that may contribute to this difference (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61252\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61252 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-causes-and-rates-of-graft-failure/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. ITA graft patency is over 95 percent at five years and slightly lower at 10 years, particularly if the graft is placed to the LAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-causes-and-rates-of-graft-failure/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. Right ITA graft patency is similar at five years, but falls below 90 percent at 10 years, particularly if it is placed to the right coronary artery.</p><p>The frequency and predictors of ITA graft failure were evaluated using information in the PREVENT IV trial database [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-causes-and-rates-of-graft-failure/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Occlusion within the first 12 to 18 months'</a> above.) Among 1539 patients who underwent ITA-LAD revascularization and had 12- to 18-month angiographic follow-up, the rate of ITA failure was 8.6 percent. Predictors of failure were LAD coronary artery stenosis of &lt;75 percent, additional bypass graft to the diagonal branch, and not having diabetes. Individuals who had graft failure had a significantly higher incidence of subsequent acute (&lt;14 days) clinical events likely due to a higher rate of repeat revascularization. </p><p>There has been some concern that the long-term benefit of ITA grafts should be balanced against short-term perioperative risk of graft harvest in higher-risk patients. However, this concern may not be warranted. This was suggested in a review from the Clinical Outcomes Assessment Program in the state of Washington in which left ITA grafts accounted for 82 percent of CABG procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-causes-and-rates-of-graft-failure/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Left ITA grafting was associated with a significant reduction in perioperative mortality (1.6 versus 3.7 percent when the left ITA was not used) as well as a reduction in morbid events such as ventricular arrhythmias, ventilator dependence, and the need for postoperative dialysis. These outcomes were seen in all subgroups of patients over age 75, women, and those with diabetes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Multiple arterial grafts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The benefits from single arterial grafting, compared to vein grafting, have led to the use of combinations of arterial grafts, including bilateral (right and left) ITA grafts, left ITA and radial artery grafts, and &quot;total arterial revascularization.&quot; Long-term patency for the left ITA and radial grafts appears high. </p><p>A prospective study evaluated 1131 patients undergoing elective primary multiple CABG for multivessel disease: 443 patients underwent bilateral ITA grafting and 688 underwent single ITA grafting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-causes-and-rates-of-graft-failure/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In-hospital mortality was 0.9 percent in both groups. At six to seven years, patients receiving bilateral ITA grafts had significantly higher graft patency (97.3 versus 94.3 percent), in repeat CABG-free rate (99.5 versus 97 percent), and a trend toward a lower incidence of new myocardial infarction (MI). </p><p>With free arterial grafts, an arterial segment is excised and anastomosed from the aorta to the coronary artery or, to avoid aortic manipulation, as a T (side) graft starting at a pedicled internal thoracic artery. The radial artery is the most commonly used free arterial graft while the gastroepiploic artery is, for the most part, of historical significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-causes-and-rates-of-graft-failure/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].

All patients received an ITA graft to the LAD. Patients were then randomly assigned to receive a saphenous vein graft (SVG) to the left circumflex and a radial artery graft to the right coronary artery, or the reverse. At one-year angiographic follow-up in 440 patients, the incidence of complete occlusion was significantly greater with SVGs than with radial artery grafts (13.6 versus 8.2 percent). At a mean follow-up of 7.7 years, the frequency of functional graft occlusion, defined as lack of thrombolysis in MI flow grade 3 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F51941\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51941 \">table 2</a>) was significantly lower in radial arteries (12.0 versus 19.7 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the RSVP trial, 142 patients were randomly assigned to receive either a free radial artery or SVG to a branch of the circumflex artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-causes-and-rates-of-graft-failure/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

However, this approach is technically demanding and takes longer to perform than other types of CABG. </p><p>In a review of 3220 patients undergoing total arterial coronary revascularization at the Royal Melbourne Hospital, the operative mortality was 0.7 percent, and angiographic graft patency was 97 and 89 percent at five years for left and right ITA grafts and 91 percent at one year for radial artery grafts (only 65 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-causes-and-rates-of-graft-failure/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>The safety of total arterial revascularization was also noted in a report from 27 centers in the United Kingdom included 71,470 patients who underwent CABG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-causes-and-rates-of-graft-failure/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Total arterial revascularization was performed in 5401 (7.6 percent); the frequency increased over time from 3.2 in 1992 to 11.7 percent in 2001, with variability among centers. Propensity analysis revealed a nonsignificant small increase in in-hospital mortality with total arterial revascularization (1.74 versus 1.51 percent for one artery and veins). The potential benefits from total arterial revascularization are discussed separately.
