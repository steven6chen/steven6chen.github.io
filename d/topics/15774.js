Most are benign and self-limited, such as cysts, subcutaneous fat necrosis, and certain soft tissue tumors. However, some may be because of malignancy or be a marker for other abnormalities, such as neural tube defects.</p><p>Cysts, subcutaneous fat necrosis, and tumors that present at birth or in early infancy are reviewed here. Other benign skin lesions, vesiculopustular and bullous disorders, and congenital pigmented and vascular disorders in the newborn are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benign-skin-and-scalp-lesions-in-the-newborn-and-infant\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benign skin and scalp lesions in the newborn and infant&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vascular-lesions-in-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vascular lesions in the newborn&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vesiculopustular-and-bullous-lesions-in-the-newborn-and-infant\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vesiculopustular and bullous lesions in the newborn and infant&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CYSTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common types of cysts include dermoid cysts and epidermal cysts. Other types, such as branchial cleft or thyroglossal duct cysts, may also occur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Dermoid cysts and sinuses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dermoid cysts are congenital subcutaneous lesions that are usually distributed along embryonic fusion lines of the facial processes or within the neural axis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The most common locations are overlying the anterior fontanelle, the bregma (junction of the coronal and sagittal sutures), upper lateral region of the forehead, lateral upper eyelid, and submental region, although lesions can occur anywhere on the scalp, face, spinal axis, or other body sites.</p><p>Dermoid cysts are almost always present at birth, although subtle lesions may not be noticed until, for example, trauma causes inflammation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F73660\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73660 \">picture 1</a>). They present as small (1 to 4 cm in diameter), slow-growing, asymptomatic rubbery subcutaneous nodules that are usually solitary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F61893\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61893 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F97782\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef97782 \">image 1</a>). They are nonpulsatile, noncompressible, nontender masses that appear skin-colored or blue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The skin overlying the cyst appears normal unless a pit or a sinus is present.</p><p>The characteristic histologic findings include a lining of epidermis and evidence of adnexal structures, such as hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and eccrine and apocrine sweat apparatus. Foci of keratinization and sometimes mesodermal skin components may be present. These features distinguish dermoid cysts from epidermoid cysts. The latter typically appear later in life on the trunk and extremities. They generally are intradermal and do not uniformly contain hair follicles and sebaceous glands.</p><p>Dermal sinus tracts may connect cysts to the skin surface or to underlying structures such as the bone, central nervous system (CNS), or paranasal sinuses. Cutaneous sinuses are 1 to 5 mm in length and may have a small tuft of hair protruding from the orifice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Connections to the CNS are most frequent with midline or nasal dermoid cysts, occurring in approximately 25 percent of cases. A pit or sinus is associated with approximately one-half of nasal dermoid cysts. Midline lesions, most commonly in the lumbosacral region, are often markers of spinal dysraphism, including a tethered cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Sinus tracts to the skin are usually detected when they become infected and drain purulent material. If the sinus or cyst communicates with the CNS, cerebrospinal fluid may drain from the lesion. This connection also allows entry of bacteria, and may be detected in a patient presenting with meningitis caused by unusual organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Patients with midline lesions should be evaluated with neuroimaging to detect CNS connections or underlying spinal dysraphism. Patients with findings on neuroimaging or other clinical abnormalities should be referred to a neurosurgeon.</p><p>Dermoid cysts should be surgically excised because of the risk of associated complications; the timing of excision depends upon the site and any associated findings. The most common complication is infection, including meningitis in lesions that connect to the CNS. In addition, the cysts may adhere to the periosteum or erode underlying skull [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Nasal dermoids typically enlarge, resulting in damage to the nasal bones. Malignant degeneration can occur but is rare.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Other cysts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thyroglossal duct cysts are the most common form of congenital cyst in the neck. They are cysts of epithelial remnants of the thyroglossal tract and present characteristically as a midline neck mass at the level of the thyrohyoid membrane, closely associated with the hyoid bone. Affected patients should be referred for surgical excision of the cyst if there is infection or persistent drainage. If the size of the lesion and thyroid function are not problems, they can be followed clinically. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroglossal-duct-cysts-and-ectopic-thyroid\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thyroglossal duct cysts and ectopic thyroid&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Branchial cleft cysts usually arise from the first and second branchial arches. They are commonly located anterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the lower third of the lateral neck (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F59067\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59067 \">picture 3</a>). The cysts often contain lymphoid tissue. Third branchial cleft cysts are found at the head of the clavicles.</p><p>Epidermal cysts result when epidermal cells located within the dermis proliferate and do not communicate with the surface. They can arise from occluded pilosebaceous follicles, entrapment of epidermal cells along embryonic lines of closures, or traumatic displacement of epidermal cells into the dermis. Epidermal cysts usually develop after puberty, although some present in the newborn period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Examples in newborns include milia and median raphe cysts. Their histologic appearance may be similar to dermoid cysts or they may contain stratified squamous epithelium.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">SUBCUTANEOUS FAT NECROSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Subcutaneous fat necrosis (SFN) is a rare condition that affects newborns in the first few weeks of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. It typically affects term or postterm newborns and usually follows perinatal complications such as birth asphyxia, hypothermia, meconium aspiration syndrome, newborn failure to thrive, forceps delivery, and maternal high blood pressure <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. Cases have been reported following neonatal cardiac surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/12,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14</a>]. One case series identified possible additional risk factors, including macrosomia; exposure to active or passive smoking during pregnancy; and maternal, paternal, or newborn risk factors for thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Clinical features of SFN include multiple firm nontender subcutaneous nodules or large plaques that appear one to four weeks after birth. Commonly affected sites are the cheeks, buttocks, back, and limbs; the overlying skin may be erythematous (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F83790\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83790 \">picture 4</a>). It often occurs over bony prominences. The anterior trunk tends to be spared. Lesions may become fluctuant as fat liquefies; some become calcified. SFN usually resolves completely within one to two months, although it may persist up to six months, especially when lesions are calcified.</p><p>The histologic appearance of the lesions is a granulomatous reaction in the fat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This includes foreign body giant cells, lymphocytes, histiocytes, and fibroblasts; needle-shaped clefts are seen within the histiocytes and giant cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Fibrosis develops as the lesions resolve.</p><p>SFN should be differentiated from sclerema neonatorum (SN), which also occurs during the first few months after birth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70556\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70556 \">table 1</a>). SN is characterized by the presence of diffuse, waxlike hardening of the subcutaneous adipose tissue, in which the skin is bound to the underlying muscle and bone, resulting in respiratory and feeding difficulties and flexion contractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/15,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17,18</a>]. Affected newborns are often preterm and severely ill, with a poor prognosis. In contrast to the histology of SFN, there is minimal subcutaneous inflammation, prominent thickening of the trabeculae supporting the subcutaneous adipose tissue and an absence of fat necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Hypercalcemia is a serious complication that has been associated with some cases of SFN, although the frequency is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11</a>]. Affected infants may present with irritability, anorexia, constipation, and failure to thrive. Seizures, renal failure, and cardiac arrest can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/10,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,19</a>]. The mechanism of hypercalcemia associated with SFN is unknown. One hypothesis is that intestinal calcium uptake is stimulated by 1,25(OH)2D3 that is stimulated by macrophages present in the infiltrates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Reported treatments for severe hypercalcemia in infants with subcutaneous fat necrosis have included hydration, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a>, corticosteroids, and bisphosphonates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p>Hypocalcemia in association with subcutaneous fat necrosis also has been described in a case report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. This patient was treated with vitamin D analogs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-hypocalcemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal hypocalcemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other infrequent complications of subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn include thrombocytopenia and hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/10,23-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,23-28</a>]. Thrombocytopenia typically appears before or simultaneously with the cutaneous lesions and resolves spontaneously over the next days to weeks. The cause of thrombocytopenia is not known; sequestration of platelets within the subcutaneous tissue has been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>The management of SFN is expectant, as most lesions resolve spontaneously. Scarring may be diminished if calcified lesions are drained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Infants should be closely monitored for the development of hypercalcemia. Serum calcium concentration should be measured at least every other week; in extensive cases, a calcium level should be drawn weekly. </p><p>In extensive cases, serum calcium concentration should be measured at least biweekly for up to six months or until the lesions clinically resolve.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">TUMORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of soft tissue tumors present at birth or during the first year of life. In one report, 20 percent of a series of these tumors in children presented in this period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. More than 75 percent were pathologically benign. The most common benign tumors were hemangiomas and vascular malformations. Malignancies affecting the skin, such as infantile fibrosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, and congenital leukemia are rare.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Benign tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Benign soft tissue tumors in newborns and infants include infantile hemangiomas, vascular malformations, infantile myofibromatosis, congenital self-healing reticulohistiocytosis, and cutaneous mastocytosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Infantile hemangiomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infantile hemangiomas are discussed separately.

In two series, 90 percent were detected during the first year of life, with 60 percent found at birth or soon after [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. In most cases, these tumors are sporadic, but rare familial cases have been described. Both autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant inheritance patterns have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. Mutations in the <em>PDGFRB</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>NOTCH3 </em>genes, which encode the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta and the human homolog of the Drosophila melanogaster type I membrane protein Notch3, respectively, have been identified as the cause of autosomal dominant infantile myofibromatosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].</p><p>The condition occurs in two forms, solitary (the more frequent type) and multicentric. In the solitary form, a single lesion affecting the skin or muscle is present, most commonly on the head, neck, or trunk. Solitary lesions are more likely to occur in males (69 percent of cases in one series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Multiple lesions are present in the multicentric form, which may affect bones and viscera as well as soft tissues. The multicentric form is more likely to be congenital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/32,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,38,39</a>].</p><p>The superficial lesions are rubbery and firm rounded nodules and may be mobile (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F71251%7EDERM%2F61534%7EDERM%2F50300\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71251 graphicRef61534 graphicRef50300 \">picture 5A-C</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The deeper lesions are nonmobile. They range in diameter from 1 to 7 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In some cases, the overlying skin has a red or purple discoloration that may mimic a hemangioma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infantile-hemangiomas-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infantile hemangiomas: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, and complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The histologic appearance is similar in solitary and multiple cutaneous and visceral lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. There are well-circumscribed masses of spindle-shaped cells staining as fibroblasts or smooth muscle cells, bland necrosis with stippled calcification, and plentiful thin-walled vessels. Atypia is uniformly absent.</p><p>The diagnosis of the multicentric form of infantile myofibromatosis is usually made on the basis of clinical features and characteristic histopathology. The diagnosis of the solitary form is made by biopsy to distinguish it from fibrosarcoma, leiomyoma-leiomyosarcoma, hemangiopericytoma, and neurofibroma. After histopathologic diagnosis, evaluation should include a radiographic survey to detect osseous lesions, electrocardiogram, and ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) imaging of the abdomen and thorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>The course is usually benign in infants with soft tissue lesions and no visceral involvement; lesions usually spontaneously involute within one to two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/32,38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,38-40</a>]. However, the condition may be fatal in infants with the multicentric form and extensive visceral involvement, especially of the lung. </p><p>Close observation of these tumors is often appropriate for solitary or multiple soft tissue lesions without visceral involvement because of the high rate of spontaneous regression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. Visceral myofibromas or tumors that affect function are surgically excised. Recurrence is unusual and can be managed by reexcision or treated with chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Congenital self-healing reticulohistiocytosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Congenital self-healing reticulohistiocytosis (CSHR, Hashimoto-Pritzker disease) is a benign, self-regressing variant of Langerhans cell histiocytosis with isolated cutaneous involvement. CSHR is an uncommon disease; however, because of the high rate of spontaneous resolution and lack of clinical recognition, its incidence is likely underestimated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. </p><p>CSHR presents at birth or in the newborn period as solitary (25 percent of cases) or multiple cutaneous nodules that may be located anywhere on the infant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F75074\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75074 \">picture 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The nodules often centrally ulcerate either before or shortly after birth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F56146\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56146 \">picture 7</a>). Vesicles and bullae also have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. All lesions heal within a few months, sometimes leaving an atrophic white scar. </p><p>The diagnosis of CSHR is based upon the histopathologic evaluation of a skin biopsy. Histology shows a proliferation of mononuclear cells resembling Langerhans cells with characteristic, abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and a lobulated, kidney-shaped nucleus. Immunostaining is positive for CD1a, CD4, CD207, and S-100 protein. Staining for E-cadherin, Ki-67, and phosphorylated histone H3 is not helpful in differentiating CSHR from disseminated Langerhans cell histiocytosis with cutaneous involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Characteristic features seen on electron microscopy are dense bodies, regularly laminated bodies, and Birbeck granules. </p><p>Histopathologic and immunophenotypic features distinguish CSHR from other nodular neonatal lesions such as dermoid cyst, pilomatricoma, congenital Spitz nevus, infantile myofibromatosis, and congenital fibrosarcoma. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Dermoid cysts and sinuses'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cutaneous-adnexal-tumors#H135421819\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cutaneous adnexal tumors&quot;, section on 'Pilomatricoma'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spitzoid-melanocytic-neoplasms-spitz-nevus-and-atypical-spitz-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spitzoid melanocytic neoplasms (Spitz nevus and atypical Spitz tumors)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Infantile myofibromatosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Infantile fibrosarcoma'</a> below.)</p><p>The lack of extracutaneous involvement and the spontaneous regression of lesions differentiate CSHR from other forms of Langerhans cell histiocytosis with skin involvement. Evaluation for extracutaneous involvement includes a complete blood count, coagulation studies, serum chemistries, liver function tests, urine osmolality, chest and bone radiographs, abdominal ultrasound, and bone marrow biopsy if necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

However, close clinical and laboratory monitoring is important because of the possibility of recurrence or progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. A review of 126 reported cases of CSHR found a recurrence rate of 10 percent (all within the first year of life) and a mortality rate of 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Cutaneous mastocytosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cutaneous mastocytomas are rare lesions composed of mast cells that occur in childhood (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F76891%7EDERM%2F50284\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76891 graphicRef50284 \">picture 8A-B</a>). They may be solitary or multiple. Manipulation of the lesion by rubbing or pressure may trigger mast cell mediator release with resultant flushing and occasionally hypotension. In most cases, the caretakers have noticed this phenomenon and can describe it, without the need to disturb the lesion and induce symptoms.

The tumor typically involves the distal extremities, although the head and neck region is affected more frequently in infants than older children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/29,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,50</a>].</p><p>Molecular biologic and immunohistochemical methods are available to differentiate these tumors from other spindle sarcomas involving children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. A characteristic translocation t(12;15)(p13;q25) that results in a fusion gene called ETV6-NTRK3 (also known as Tel-TrkC) has been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>].</p><p>Although locally infiltrative, these tumors rarely metastasize and have a good prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-57</a>]. However, the amputation rate exceeds 50 percent, and efforts to successfully salvage limbs by the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/56,58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,58,59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Rhabdomyosarcoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rhabdomyosarcoma is a highly malignant skeletal muscle neoplasm that arises from embryonal mesenchyme. The primary cutaneous form typically presents as a single firm subcutaneous nodule that adheres to the skin above and tissue underneath [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The overlying skin may be erythematous or shiny, occasionally mimicking a deep hemangioma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. An extremely rare neonatal presentation is alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, a very aggressive tumor that frequently includes multiple skin and subcutaneous metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>].

Metastatic cutaneous lesions are present in approximately one-third of children with congenital neuroblastoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. These appear as firm, nontender bluish-red nodules and papules distributed over the entire body. The lesions have a distinctive response to rubbing characterized by central blanching with a surrounding halo of erythema that persists for 30 to 60 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/40,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,63</a>]. The mechanism is thought to be vasoconstriction induced by catecholamine release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-nodules-in-newborns-and-infants/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].

Most are benign and self-limited (eg, cysts), but some may be related to malignancy or a marker for other abnormalities (eg, neural tube defect). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dermoid cysts are small (1 to 4 cm in diameter), usually solitary, slow-growing, asymptomatic, rubbery, nontender masses that appear skin-colored or blue; the skin overlying the cyst appears normal unless a pit or a sinus is present. They are commonly located over the anterior fontanelle, junction of the coronal and sagittal sutures, upper lateral region of the forehead, lateral upper eyelid, and submental region. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Dermoid cysts and sinuses'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thyroglossal duct cysts are the most common congenital cyst in the neck; they characteristically present as a midline neck mass at the level of the thyrohyoid membrane. Branchial cleft cysts are commonly located anterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the lower third of the lateral neck or at the head of the clavicles. Epidermal cysts result when epidermal cells located within the dermis proliferate and do not communicate with the surface. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Other cysts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subcutaneous fat necrosis (SFN) is a rare condition that typically affects term or postterm newborns in the first few weeks of life; it usually follows perinatal complications. It is characterized by multiple firm nontender subcutaneous nodules or large plaques over bony prominences (eg, cheeks, buttocks, back, limbs); the overlying skin may be erythematous. SFN may be associated with hypercalcemia. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Subcutaneous fat necrosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benign soft tissue tumors in newborns and infants include infantile hemangiomas, vascular malformations, infantile myofibromatosis, congenital self-healing reticulohistiocytosis, and cutaneous mastocytosis.
