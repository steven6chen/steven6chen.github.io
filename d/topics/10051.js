As a result, these factors need to be considered when comparing individual studies or attempting to apply results of the literature clinically.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1924210782\"><span class=\"h2\">Differences in clinical practice: Limits of viability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In developed countries, there are global and regional differences in the level of initial care that is provided to infants at the threshold of viability (stage of fetal maturity that ensures a reasonable chance of extrauterine survival). These differences in clinical practice impact survival (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75260\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75260 \">table 2</a>) and potentially neurodevelopmental outcome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63848\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63848 \">table 3</a>). As a result, it is challenging to compare survival and neurodevelopmental outcomes from studies that may differ in their approach to resuscitation for extremely preterm infants, and to interpret these data as it applies to individual patients.</p><p>The issues regarding interpreting the data for preterm infants at the limit of viability are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=periviable-birth-limit-of-viability#H8144879\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Periviable birth (Limit of viability)&quot;, section on 'Interpreting the data'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1924210907\"><span class=\"h2\">Study design factors</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Study population &ndash; Differences in defining the study population make it challenging to compare data from different studies. For example, the use of birth weight (BW) classification versus gestational age (GA) can be problematic as the population may include relatively more mature but small for gestational age (SGA) infants within a given BW category. Outcome results may be impacted if there are a significant number of SGA patients because SGA infants have a greater risk of neonatal morbidities and poorer outcomes compared with their appropriate for gestational age (AGA) counterparts, but typically have better outcomes compared with more preterm SGA infants at equivalent BW [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-neurodevelopmental-outcome-of-preterm-infants-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infants-with-fetal-intrauterine-growth-restriction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infants with fetal (intrauterine) growth restriction&quot;</a>). As dating techniques have improved, GA classifications have become predominant. Although GA groupings may allow for inclusion of large and small for GA infants in the same group, groups defined by this method are more likely to be at similar <span class=\"nowrap\">embryologic/fetal</span> development stages than classification based on BW.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation methods &ndash; There is variability in the evaluation tools used to assess outcomes in studies and results may not be directly comparable. For example, several studies have shown that results from the 3<sup>rd</sup> edition (Bayley III, 2006) result in higher cognitive scores than the 2<sup>nd</sup> edition (Bayley II, 1992) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-neurodevelopmental-outcome-of-preterm-infants-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. It remains unclear whether the Bayley III overestimates cognitive performance in comparison or is a more valid assessment of cognitive function than Bayley II.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subsequent confounding factors &ndash; Subsequent factors that may affect neurodevelopmental development and school readiness include sociodemographic factors (eg, maternal education), ongoing health issues, and participation in early intervention programs. The presence of these factors may vary, making it challenging to compare results from different studies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=school-readiness-for-children-in-the-united-states#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;School readiness for children in the United States&quot;, section on 'Factors related to a child's ability to learn'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1924210976\"><span class=\"h2\">Changes in clinical outcome and practice over time</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Improved perinatal care has improved survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-neurodevelopmental-outcome-of-preterm-infants-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, the impact of changes in clinical practice on improving neurodevelopmental outcome is more difficult to accurately ascertain as the improved survival rate has outpaced any concomitant decrease in the rate of long-term neurodevelopmental sequelae.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3965443069\"><span class=\"h3\">Neurodevelopmental outcome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data are inconsistent regarding whether neurodevelopmental outcome for preterm infants has improved along with survival with advances in perinatal care. </p><p>However, these conflicting results may be explained by differences in improved outcome based on gestational age. This was illustrated by a population-based study from France (Etude &eacute;pid&eacute;miologique sur les petits &acirc;ges gestationnels [EPIPAGE] and EPIPAGE-2) of preterm infants that reported survival without severe or moderate neuromotor or motor sensory disabilities increased from 1997 to 2011 for infants born at 25 to 26 weeks gestation (45.5 versus 62.3 percent) and for those born at 27 to 31 weeks gestation (82.1 versus 90.3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-neurodevelopmental-outcome-of-preterm-infants-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, there was no difference in survival without major disabilities between the two cohorts for infants born earlier at 24 weeks gestation (29 versus 25.8 percent) or those born later between 32 and 34 weeks gestation (95.7 versus 96.8 percent). In addition, there was only one survivor born at 22 to 23 weeks gestation who was in the 2011 cohort. </p><p>The following large or population-based studies from developed countries throughout the world demonstrated improved survival and neurodevelopmental outcome in preterm infants as survival improved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-neurodevelopmental-outcome-of-preterm-infants-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A report from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Neonatal Research Network that assessed neurodevelopmental outcome for 3785 extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants (BW 401 to 1000 g and GA between 22 to 32 weeks) demonstrated improved survival and neurodevelopmental outcome at 18 to 22 months adjusted age over three time periods (1993 to 1994, 1995 to 1996, and 1997 to 1998) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-neurodevelopmental-outcome-of-preterm-infants-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A population-based Australian study of preterm infants with GA below 28 weeks reported infants born in 2005 compared with those born in 1990s had lower rates of severe developmental delay (3.7 versus 14.8 percent) and severe disability (3.7 versus 15.4 percent) at two years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-neurodevelopmental-outcome-of-preterm-infants-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

At three-year follow-up, there was a higher proportion of survivors without disability (6 to 16 percent); however, there was no change in the proportion of survivors with severe disability (18 versus 19 percent). Severe disability was defined as nonambulatory CP, blindness, profound hearing loss not improved by hearing aids, and developmental and cognitive test scores that were more than 3 standard deviations (SD) below the mean.

In addition, the academic performance at early school age was poorer for children born in 2005 compared with those born in earlier time periods. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H97616292\"><span class=\"h3\">Changes in clinical practice</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Observed changes in practices over time are felt to be major contributors to both improved neonatal survival and possibly neurodevelopmental outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-neurodevelopmental-outcome-of-preterm-infants-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. As a result, comparisons between birth cohort eras should be interpreted with caution. This is of particular importance when reviewing adult prematurity outcomes to more recent birth cohorts because an extremely preterm infant born in 2015 compared with an infant born in 1993 would receive different therapeutic interventions and as a result, may have different risks for long-term outcome. This was illustrated in a study from the NICHD network that showed several changes in clinical practice (eg, increased administration of antenatal corticosteroids, and decreasing rates of postnatal corticosteroid administration and delivery room intubation) concomitant with improved neonatal survival and reduction in select morbidities (eg, severe intraventricular hemorrhage [IVH] and late-onset sepsis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-neurodevelopmental-outcome-of-preterm-infants-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, neurodevelopmental outcome was not evaluated in this report.</p><p>The following <span class=\"nowrap\">changes/interventions</span> in perinatal care over the past several decades may affect neurodevelopment outcome either directly or indirectly (by reducing associated complications such as periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage [PIVH]).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antenatal corticosteroid therapy &minus; In a multicenter prospective study of extremely preterm (EPT) infants &le;25 weeks gestation born between 1993 and 2009 from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Neonatal Research Network, infants who received antenatal corticosteroids had a lower rate of death or neurodevelopmental impairment at 18 to 24 months corrected age compared with nonexposed infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-neurodevelopmental-outcome-of-preterm-infants-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In this cohort, antenatal corticosteroids were associated with a reduced incidence of moderate to severe CP. In addition, antenatal corticosteroids reduced the duration of mechanical ventilation and risk of severe PIVH, both of which are associated with increased risk of neurodevelopmental impairment. In a subsequent publication from the NICHD Neonatal Research Network of EPT infants born between 2006 and 2011, the beneficial effect of antenatal steroids was dose-dependent and maximal benefit was associated with a complete course of antenatal steroids when patients were evaluated at 18 to 24 months corrected age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-neurodevelopmental-outcome-of-preterm-infants-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].
