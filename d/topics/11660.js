Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), previously known as von Recklinghausen disease, is the most common type. The hallmarks of NF1 are the multiple caf&eacute;-au-lait macules and associated cutaneous neurofibromas. The condition is called segmental NF1 when clinical features are limited to one area of the body.</p><p>The management and prognosis of NF1 are reviewed here. The pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis are discussed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurofibromatosis-type-1-nf1-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1): Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>). The other two forms of neurofibromatosis, neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) and schwannomatosis, are also discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurofibromatosis-type-2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurofibromatosis type 2&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=schwannomatosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Schwannomatosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H196003494\"><span class=\"h1\">SURVEILLANCE AND SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Longitudinal care for individuals with NF1 aims at the early detection and symptomatic treatment of complications as they occur. The decision to obtain testing such as imaging studies depends upon the history and physical findings. Clinical evaluation appears to be more useful to detect complications than are screening investigations in asymptomatic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurofibromatosis-type-1-nf1-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Thus, for example, guidelines of the Children's Tumor Foundation do not recommend neuroimaging as a screening modality for optic pathway gliomas (OPGs), although not all clinicians agree.

Ideally, ophthalmologic screening should include visual acuity testing, confrontation visual field testing, color vision testing, and assessment of pupils, eyelids, irises, fundi, and extraocular motility, although the full range of assessment may not be feasible in the infant or young child. The evaluation should begin when NF1 first is suspected and be repeated at annual intervals or when symptoms develop.</p><p>Any child with visual symptoms or physical signs (eg, proptosis, decreased visual acuity, or precocious puberty) should have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits to investigate for an OPG. OPGs appear as an enlargement of the optic nerve or chiasm on MRI. A consensus panel convened by the Children's Tumor Foundation did not recommend neuroimaging for screening in asymptomatic children with NF1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurofibromatosis-type-1-nf1-management-and-prognosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], and many neurofibromatosis clinics follow young children with NF1 according to these guidelines. Others have employed protocols that include MRI of the brain and orbits in addition to ophthalmologic examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurofibromatosis-type-1-nf1-management-and-prognosis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>The outcome of systematic screening for OPG with MRI and ophthalmic examinations in young children was evaluated in a clinical study of children &lt;6 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurofibromatosis-type-1-nf1-management-and-prognosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. OPG were detected in 9 of 69 children who were asymptomatic and had normal ophthalmic examinations. Three of these children were treated with chemotherapy (due to progression of the lesion on subsequent MRI <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ophthalmic examination) and retained normal visual function. Four of six children who presented with proptosis or visual impairment had not had a prior clinical diagnosis of NF1 or any monitoring for vision problems. These observations suggest that systematic screening for OPG permits early intervention and may reduce complications. This was not a randomized study, however, and other experts in the field disagree with the use of MRI for screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurofibromatosis-type-1-nf1-management-and-prognosis/abstract/7,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11</a>]. A subsequent review of 826 children with NF1 who had routine MRI screening at one center revealed optic pathway tumors in 18 percent, with a median age of diagnosis of three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurofibromatosis-type-1-nf1-management-and-prognosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Children with no evidence of an optic pathway tumor by 18 months of age did not subsequently develop one. If this finding is confirmed, it might justify MRI screening to obviate the need for ophthalmologic follow-up in the 80 percent or more who will not have tumors. In any case, there is a consensus that it is important to make the clinical diagnosis of NF1 in very young children so that ophthalmic evaluations are initiated.</p><p>There is little consensus regarding the frequency of visual examinations and neuroimaging for children with NF1 in whom OPG have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurofibromatosis-type-1-nf1-management-and-prognosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The suggested intervals vary between 3 and 24 months depending upon the tumor site, severity of visual impairment, and the evidence of progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurofibromatosis-type-1-nf1-management-and-prognosis/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. Measurement of retinal nerve fiber thickness may be helpful in sensitive detection of loss of visual acuity in children with optic gliomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurofibromatosis-type-1-nf1-management-and-prognosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The treatment of OPGs is discussed separately.

Such screening is not incorporated into NF1 guidelines given the long period of risk (adolescence through mid-adulthood) and the variable location of tumor development. Primary care clinicians, parents, and children entering adolescence should be educated about the risk of MPNST and strongly encouraged to report the development of any signs or symptoms to a clinician familiar with NF1. Prompt investigation, including MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurofibromatosis-type-1-nf1-management-and-prognosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], should be initiated in symptomatic patients.</p><p>Positron emission tomographic (PET) scanning may be useful in the distinction between an MPNST and a benign plexiform neurofibroma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurofibromatosis-type-1-nf1-management-and-prognosis/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>].

Neuroimaging should not be part of a routine diagnostic evaluation, because of the uncertain relationship between MRI findings and learning disabilities.

The decision to obtain diagnostic studies depends upon the history and physical findings.

No specific medical treatment for neurofibromas exists. Surgical treatment and pain management of plexiform neurofibromas can be challenging.
