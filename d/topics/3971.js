Germ cell tumors (GCTs) account for 95 percent of testicular cancers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F81626\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81626 \">table 1</a>). They may consist of one predominant histologic pattern or represent a mix of multiple histologic types. For treatment purposes, two broad categories of testis tumors are recognized: pure seminoma (no nonseminomatous elements present) and all others, which together are termed nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCTs). In most series, the ratio of seminoma to NSGCT is approximately one.</p><p>Testicular cancer has become one of the most curable of solid neoplasms because of remarkable treatment advances beginning in the late 1970s. Prior to that time, testicular cancer accounted for 11 percent of all cancer deaths in men between the ages of 25 and 34, and the five-year survival rate was 64 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In 2017, approximately 400 deaths from testicular cancer are expected in the United States, with a five-year survival rate of over 95 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of testicular cancer will be presented here. Optimal therapy, which varies with the stage of disease, is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-testicular-germ-cell-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of testicular germ cell tumors&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testicular tumors usually present as a nodule or painless swelling of one testicle, which may be noted incidentally by the patient or by his sexual partner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Occasionally, a man with a previously small atrophic testis will note enlargement. Approximately 30 to 40 percent of patients complain of a dull ache or heavy sensation in the lower abdomen, perianal area, or scrotum, while acute pain is the presenting symptom in 10 percent.</p><p>The presenting manifestations of testicular cancer are attributable to metastatic disease in approximately 10 percent of patients. Symptoms vary with the site of metastasis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A neck mass (supraclavicular lymph node metastasis)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cough or dyspnea (pulmonary metastasis)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, or gastrointestinal hemorrhage (retroduodenal metastasis)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lumbar back pain (bulky retroperitoneal disease involving the psoas muscle or nerve roots)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone pain (skeletal metastasis)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central or peripheral nervous system symptoms (cerebral, spinal cord, or peripheral root involvement)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unilateral or bilateral lower extremity swelling (iliac or caval venous obstruction or thrombosis)</p><p/><p>Gynecomastia, which occurs in approximately 5 percent of men with testicular germ cell tumors, is a systemic endocrine manifestation of these neoplasms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It also occurs in 20 to 30 percent of patients with the less common (2 percent of testicular tumors) Leydig cell tumors of the testes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. These tumors are found in 6- to 10- year-old boys who present with precocious puberty and in 26- to 35-year-old men who present with a testicular mass, gynecomastia, impotence, and loss of libido.</p><p>Gynecomastia is usually associated with production of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) by foci of choriocarcinoma or trophoblastic cells in the tumor. However, the relationship between gynecomastia, testicular tumor morphology, and endocrine abnormalities remains incompletely defined. In individual patients, gynecomastia may or may not be associated with elevated serum concentrations of hCG, human chorionic somatomammotropin, prolactin, estrogens, or androgens. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-causes-of-gynecomastia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and causes of gynecomastia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-gynecomastia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and evaluation of gynecomastia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with marked overproduction of hCG can develop another endocrine complication, paraneoplastic hyperthyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Thyroid-stimulating hormone and hCG have a common alpha subunit and a beta subunit with considerable homology. As a result, hCG has weak thyroid-stimulating activity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-thyroid-disease-in-pregnancy#H994022\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of thyroid disease in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'hCG and thyroid function'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-that-cause-hyperthyroidism#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders that cause hyperthyroidism&quot;, section on 'Trophoblastic disease and germ cell tumors'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with testicular cancer may rarely develop a paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis. Most of these patients have anti-Ma2 (also called anti-Ta) antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The Ma2 antigen is selectively expressed in the neuronal nucleoli of normal brain tissue and the testicular tumor of the patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paraneoplastic and autoimmune encephalitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis#H3370761\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paraneoplastic and autoimmune encephalitis&quot;, section on 'Ma2-associated encephalitis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Testicular examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical examination of the testes should begin with bimanual examination of the scrotal contents, starting with the normal contralateral testis. This permits the examiner to appreciate the relative size, contour, and consistency of the normal testis as a baseline for comparison with the suspected gonad. The testis should be carefully palpated between the thumb and first two fingers of the examining hand.</p><p>The normal gonad is homogeneous in consistency, freely movable, and separable from the epididymis. Any firm, hard, or fixed area within the substance of the tunica albuginea should be considered suspicious until proven otherwise. Further evaluation of the affected side should be directed toward possible involvement of the spermatic cord, scrotal investments, or skin.</p><p>Testicular tumors tend to remain ovoid, being limited by the tough investing tunica albuginea. However, spread to the epididymis or spermatic cord occurs in 10 to 15 percent of patients. In general, a seminoma tends to expand within the testis as a painless, rubbery enlargement, while an embryonal carcinoma or teratocarcinoma forms an irregular mass with indiscrete borders. However, this distinction is not always easily appreciated.</p><p>A hydrocele may be present and can make evaluation of a suspected testicular tumor more difficult. In such cases, ultrasonography of the scrotum is a rapid, reliable technique to exclude a hydrocele or epididymitis; it is indicated in any man with a suspected testicular tumor. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Scrotal ultrasound'</a> below.)</p><p>Physical examination should also include palpation of the abdomen for evidence of nodal disease or visceral involvement. Routine assessment of the supraclavicular lymph nodes may reveal adenopathy in men with advanced disease. Examination of the chest may disclose gynecomastia or raise suspicion for thoracic involvement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H137129371\"><span class=\"h3\">Cryptorchidism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Men with a history of cryptorchidism and prior orchiopexy are at increased risk for testicular cancer in both testes (greater in the undescended one), although the magnitude of increased risk compared with men in the general population is poorly quantified. Regardless, testicular self-examination is an important part of the routine evaluation. Because of the rarity of such tumors, surveillance scrotal ultrasound (in the absence of clinical exam findings) is not indicated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of and risk factors for testicular germ cell tumors&quot;, section on 'Cryptorchidism'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=undescended-testes-cryptorchidism-in-children-management#H170011\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Undescended testes (cryptorchidism) in children: Management&quot;, section on 'Long-term follow-up'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In any man with a solid, firm mass within the testis, testicular cancer must be the considered diagnosis until proven otherwise. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of testicular cancer provides the best opportunity for cure. Nevertheless, both patient and clinician factors often contribute to a delay in diagnosis. Painless scrotal masses are sometimes ignored, while testicular cancers presenting with scrotal pain are often treated as epididymitis.</p><p>The differential diagnosis of a testicular mass includes testicular torsion, epididymitis, or epididymo-orchitis. Less common problems include hydrocele, varicocele, hernia, hematoma, spermatocele, or syphilitic gumma. In patients in whom the diagnosis is unclear or in whom a hydrocele precludes adequate examination, imaging studies are an important second step in determining the cause. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-acute-scrotal-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of acute scrotal pain in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnostic evaluation of men with suspected testicular cancer includes scrotal ultrasound followed by radiographic testing, measurement of serum tumor markers, radical inguinal orchiectomy, and in some cases, retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND). The results are used to determine the histologic type and extent of disease, and to guide therapy. Testicular biopsy is not performed as part of the evaluation due to concern that it may result in tumor seeding into the scrotal sac or metastatic spread of tumor into the inguinal nodes.</p><p>In addition, since the vast majority of these patients are young men, consideration should be given to fertility issues and sperm cryopreservation during the initial diagnostic evaluation. If possible, a baseline sperm count and sperm banking should be performed prior to the radiographic diagnostic evaluation in order to avoid radiation exposure of the sperm. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Cryopreservation of sperm'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Scrotal ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bilateral scrotal ultrasound can distinguish intrinsic from extrinsic testicular lesions with a high degree of accuracy and can detect intratesticular lesions as small as 1 to 2 mm in diameter. In men with testicular masses, scrotal ultrasound has become an extension of the physical examination, but it should never be considered a substitute for the latter.</p><p>A cystic or fluid-filled mass is unlikely to represent malignancy. By comparison, seminomas appear as well-defined hypoechoic lesions without cystic areas, while nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCTs) are typically inhomogeneous with calcifications, cystic areas, and indistinct margins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. However, this distinction is not always apparent; in one series for example, the radiologist's interpretation of the type of tumor was correct in only 70 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Even magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) does not improve the specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Another limitation is that because the tunica albuginea is difficult to discern by ultrasonography, local tumor staging has proved to be unreliable with this technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. In the above report, tumor staging was accurate in 44 percent of seminomas and only 8 percent of nonseminomatous tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. For these reasons, scrotal ultrasound cannot replace radical inguinal orchiectomy for the determination of histology and stage.</p><p>The widespread use of scrotal ultrasound in the evaluation of male infertility occasionally leads to the diagnosis of an incidental nonpalpable testicular mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-male-with-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the male with infertility&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the largest series, 46 asymptomatic lesions smaller than 10 mm were identified in 4418 men evaluated for infertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The majority of the men did not undergo surgery and were followed with active surveillance and serial ultrasound. Among the eight patients who either chose surgery or who had surgery because of progressive enlargement of the lesion, one seminoma and two Leydig cell tumors were identified. The remaining five patients had benign lesions. The authors concluded that ultrasound surveillance for small, incidentally discovered testicular masses is a safe and appropriate alternative to surgery. For those men with an incidentally detected testicular mass (and normal serum tumor markers) who choose to undergo surgery, less-radical surgery (ie, excisional biopsy), rather than orchiectomy, is appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3275416884\"><span class=\"h3\">Microlithiasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testicular ultrasonography identifies patients with microlithiasis, defined as five or more echogenic 1 to 3 mm foci in a single cross-sectional ultrasound image. Retrospective cohort studies have demonstrated a strong association between microlithiasis and testicular cancer, both in adult and pediatric populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. However, a causal link is unlikely as ultrasound surveillance of patients with microlithiasis with no clinical risk factors has not shown an increased incidence of cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Consequently, patients with microlithiasis and otherwise normal ultrasound findings do not require further imaging, although they should be instructed in testicular self-examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">CT scan</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis, and a chest radiograph are generally performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Chest CT is recommended if the chest radiograph is abnormal or if metastatic disease involving the thorax is strongly suspected.</p><p>Regional metastases first appear in the retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Although CT is the imaging modality of choice to evaluate the retroperitoneum, false-negative rates as high as 44 percent have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Occult micrometastases are responsible for most of these false negatives, as evidenced by a retroperitoneal relapse rate of 20 to 25 percent in men with clinical stage I disease who do not undergo RPLND [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].</p><p>The utility of the staging CT scan is also dependent on the cutoff value used to define an abnormal node. Most institutions use a 10 mm cutoff (measurement based upon the short axis in the transverse plane) to define pathologic adenopathy. Higher cutoffs (greater than 15 mm) yield higher false-negative rates, while lower cutoffs (less than 5 mm) may result in some patients undergoing unnecessary therapeutic RPLND [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retroperitoneal-lymph-node-dissection-for-early-stage-nonseminomatous-testicular-germ-cell-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for early stage nonseminomatous testicular germ cell tumors&quot;</a>). A more exacting method to evaluate lymph node enlargement utilizes craniocaudal measurement of lymph nodes in the suspected landing site. Above 10 mm, for every 3 mm increase in craniocaudal length in patients with nonseminomatous tumors, the risk of relapse increased by 52 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H137129438\"><span class=\"h2\">MRI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis or scrotum usually adds little to the information obtained by CT scan and ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

In a preliminary report, correct staging was achieved in more patients by PET (55 of 70 versus 49 of 70 [78 versus 70 percent]). The positive predictive value was higher with PET (21 of 25 patients with a positive PET had viable tumor identified, compared with 22 of 33 with a positive CT). However, false-negative results were a problem (only 34 of 45 patients with a negative PET scan had no tumor identified [negative predictive value 76 percent]), with a negative predictive value that was not significantly better than that achieved by CT (27 of 37 patients with a negative CT had no tumor identified [negative predictive value 73 percent]).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar results were seen in a subsequent study in 111 patients with clinical stage I NSGCT that used the negative results of PET to select patients for surveillance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Three serum tumor markers have established roles in testicular cancer: alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG; since the alpha subunit is common to several pituitary hormones), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Serum levels of AFP <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> beta-hCG are elevated in 80 to 85 percent of men with NSGCTs, even when nonmetastatic. By contrast, serum beta-hCG is elevated in less than 20 percent of testicular seminomas, and AFP is not elevated in pure seminomas.

By contrast, many European groups suggest biopsy, particularly in patients considered at increased risk of GCNIS (eg, cryptorchidism) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RPLND is the only reliable method to identify nodal micrometastases given the high false-negative rate with CT scan (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'CT scan'</a> above). It is also the gold standard for providing accurate pathologic staging of the retroperitoneum. Both the number and size of involved retroperitoneal lymph nodes have prognostic importance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retroperitoneal-lymph-node-dissection-for-early-stage-nonseminomatous-testicular-germ-cell-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for early stage nonseminomatous testicular germ cell tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Following radiographic evaluation of the retroperitoneum and radical inguinal orchiectomy, a subset of patients with low-stage NSGCT (T1-3,N0-2,M0, see below) should be considered candidates for a surgical staging RPLND. By comparison, primary chemotherapy is the treatment of choice for patients with stage III disease or high-volume stage II disease; in such patients, RPLND is reserved for those with postchemotherapy residual disease (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-risk-stratified-treatment-for-advanced-testicular-germ-cell-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial risk-stratified treatment for advanced testicular germ cell tumors&quot;</a>). Surveillance is an appropriate option for men with clinical stage I testicular cancer, especially those with limited risk factors, such as a minimal embryonal cell component and the absence of lymphovascular invasion.

Testicular cancer is staged using the eighth (2017) tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system developed jointly by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC), which applies to both seminomas and nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCTs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In the TNM system, assessments of the primary tumor (T), lymph nodes (N), and distant metastases (M) are combined with serum tumor marker values (S) for the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) to define prognostic stage groups from I to III (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110731%7EONC%2F110732\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110731 graphicRef110732 \">table 2A-B</a>). </p><p>It is important to note that for the purposes of TNM staging, the serum tumor markers should be assessed as S0 to S3 only <strong>after</strong> orchiectomy has been completed.

Approximately 80 percent of men with seminomas present with stage I disease (limited to the testicle), while 15 percent have stage II disease (limited to the retroperitoneal nodes). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-stage-i-seminoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of stage I seminoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For men who present with advanced disease, numerous staging and prognostic systems have been proposed to separate different prognostic subgroups, based primarily on single-institution experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/34-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-38</a>]. In 1997, consensus was reached on a uniform, validated prognostic model by the International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group (IGCCCG). The classification system is discussed separately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

Biopsies of suspected disease should only be performed in unusual situations, such as in patients who present with imaging-detected masses without elevated tumor markers, or the presence of disease in atypical locations (eg, bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]).

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial evaluation of a man with a suspected testicular tumor should include a physical examination of the scrotum supplemented by ultrasound to differentiate tumor from a hydrocele or epididymitis. The initial evaluation should include measurement of serum tumor markers (the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin [beta-hCG], alpha-fetoprotein [AFP], and lactate dehydrogenase [LDH]). Imaging studies should include chest radiograph as well as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis and abdomen to look for evidence of regional lymph node metastases. Prior to definitive treatment, the possible need for cryopreservation of sperm should also be considered.
