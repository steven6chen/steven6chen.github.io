Lots of viruses can take hold inside your nose, mouth, throat, or lungs, and cause cold symptoms.</p><p>Most people get over a cold without lasting problems. Even so, having a cold can be uncomfortable. And if your child has a cold, it can be hard to know when the symptoms call for a trip to the doctor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H386452673\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of the common cold?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sneezing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coughing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sniffling and runny nose</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sore throat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest congestion</p><p/><p>In children, the common cold can also cause a fever. But adults do not usually get a fever when they have a cold.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H386452680\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I tell if I have a cold or the flu?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The common cold and the flu both cause many of the same symptoms. But they also have some important differences. This table can help you tell the difference between a cold and the flu (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F56899\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56899 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H386452687\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call the doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people who have a cold do not need to see the doctor or nurse. But you should call your doctor or nurse if you have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A fever of more than 100.4&ordm; F (38&ordm; C) that comes with shaking chills, loss of appetite, or trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A fever and also have lung disease, such as emphysema or asthma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A cough that lasts longer than 10 days</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain when you cough, trouble breathing, or coughing up blood</p><p/><p>If you are older than 75, you should also call your doctor or nurse any time you get a long-lasting cough.</p><p>Take your child to the emergency room if he or she:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Becomes confused or stops responding to you</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has trouble breathing or has to work hard to breathe</p><p/><p>Call your child's doctor or nurse if he or she:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Refuses to drink anything for a long time</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is younger than 4 months</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has a fever and is not acting like him- or herself</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has a cough that lasts for more than 2 weeks and is not getting any better</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has a stuffed or runny nose that gets worse or does not get better after 2 weeks</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has red eyes or yellow goop coming out of his or her eyes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has ear pain, pulls at his or her ears, or shows other signs of having an ear infection</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H386452694\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you are a teenager or an adult, you can try cough and cold medicines that you can get without a prescription. These medicines might help with your symptoms. But they won't cure your cold, or help you get well faster.</p><p>If you decide to try nonprescription cold medicines, be sure to follow the directions on the label. Do not combine 2 or more medicines that have <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> in them. If you take too much acetaminophen, the drug can damage your liver. Also, if you have a heart condition, or you take prescription medicines, ask your pharmacist if it is safe to take the cold medicine you have in mind.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H386452701\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I know if my child has a cold?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children, the common cold is often more severe than it is in adults. It also lasts longer. Plus, children often get a fever during the first 3 days of a cold.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H386452708\"><span class=\"h1\">Are cough and cold medicines safe for children?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your child is younger than 6, you should <strong>not</strong> give him or her any cold medicines. These medicines are not safe for young children. Even if your child is older than 6, cough and cold medicines are unlikely to help.</p><p><strong>Never</strong> give <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> to any child younger than 18 years old. In children, aspirin can cause a life-threatening condition called Reye syndrome. When giving your child <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> or other nonprescription medicines, never give more than the recommended dose.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H386452715\"><span class=\"h1\">How long will I be sick?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Colds usually last 3 to 7 days in adults and 10 days in children, but some people have symptoms for up to 2 weeks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H386452722\"><span class=\"h1\">Can the common cold lead to more serious problems?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In <strong>some</strong> cases, yes. In some people having a cold can lead to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pneumonia or bronchitis (infections of the lungs)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ear infections</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Worsening of asthma symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sinus infections</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H386452729\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I keep from getting another cold?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important thing you can do is to wash your hands often with soap and water. Alcohol hand rubs work well, too. The germs that cause the common cold can live on tables, door handles, and other surfaces for at least 2 hours. You never know when you might be touching germs. That's why it's so important to clean your hands often.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H386452736\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=flu-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Flu (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sore-throat-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sore throat in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Fever in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=giving-your-child-over-the-counter-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Giving your child over-the-counter medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cough-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cough in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cough-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cough in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=coughing-up-blood-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Coughing up blood (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-you-should-know-about-antibiotics-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What you should know about antibiotics (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-common-cold-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: The common cold in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-common-cold-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: The common cold in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergic-rhinitis-seasonal-allergies-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Allergic rhinitis (seasonal allergies) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
