General guidelines for patients with OA who are performing such training are reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H384946\"><span class=\"h1\">GUIDELINES FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients should be given general guidelines to follow when weight-resistance exercises are prescribed for the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA). These include general considerations for planning an exercise program and strategies for performing exercises effectively and for avoiding injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H385036\"><span class=\"h2\">General considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>General considerations for the patient in planning weight-resistance training for OA include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Before starting any weight-resistance program, consult with a medical specialist experienced in arthritis care to learn what response you might expect from exercise and to discuss limitations. Some forms of arthritis do not respond well to weight-resistance training, and there may be some contraindications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consult with a qualified physical therapist <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> personal trainer to find out which exercises are best for your particular type of arthritis. Some exercise and stretching routines are contraindicated and can aggravate a preexisting condition.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A supervised exercise program in a gym is more desirable than an individual home-based program. People tend to be more likely to adhere to a program and to be motivated if they are being supervised. A gym has a greater diversity of equipment and classes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Find a training partner. Training partners are great for maintaining interest and motivation. A partner can also provide constructive criticism and can act as a spotter.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you are taking medication for arthritis, be aware of the possible side effects and the implications it could have for exercise. The benefits of some medications could give you a false sense of wellbeing and may allow you to push beyond your limits, which could lead to injury or exacerbation of your condition. The same guidelines should be followed with over-the-counter medications. They should not be overused. If you find little or no relief from the recommended dose, it could be a sign of a more serious condition. The use of ointments is another commonly used method of relief for the symptoms of arthritis. Ointments work by activating heat receptors in the skin. Whether or not they promote circulation is unclear. There are no scientific data that suggest how much relief is actually obtained by their use or whether they are effective in the treatment of arthritis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise at times of the day when you feel most energetic and when you are not in a hurry.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you are overweight, incorporate a weight-loss program through diet and cardiovascular exercise. This will reduce the weightbearing loads placed on the joints.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep yourself educated on the latest trends in exercise. Try different exercises. Try free weights as well as machines, as they have different benefits. Ask a lot of questions of personal trainers and other fitness experts; do not take anything for granted.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incorporate recreational activities of your choice into a fitness program such as golf, bicycling, hiking, or swimming.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have fun! You will not continue doing any activity if you do not enjoy it.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H385045\"><span class=\"h2\">Guidelines for performing exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Guidelines for patients in performing exercises effectively and in avoiding injury include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Always warm up before starting your workout routine. This promotes circulation and prepares joints for activity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once you have warmed up, do some light stretching exercises. This promotes greater flexibility and range of motion. Stretching can also provide some relief from the stiffness associated with arthritis. Do static stretches rather than ballistic stretches (static stretches are stretches that are held without bouncing for 20 to 30 seconds while ballistic stretches are stretches that are done with bouncing involved). Do not go beyond your range of motion. Overstretching can place excessive strain on muscles and joints.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Become familiar with your limitations. There is a tendency to become overanxious to get back into shape, especially after being sedentary for a long time. Start out with light weights. This will put less strain on your joints. You will gain greater results from using proper technique, good body alignment, full muscle contractions, and a slow, steady pace. Heavy weights do not always promote muscle strength and growth.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Always maintain proper body alignment. When standing, keep your knees bent to reduce stress on the lower back, keep abdominal muscles tight, keep your head positioned forward and not off to one side, and always stay focused when you are working out with weights.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use the mirrors in the gym to check your form and body alignment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Move the weights in a smooth steady motion without any sudden or jerky movements.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not &ldquo;lock-out&rdquo; your joints at the end phase of an exercise. Always try to keep a small amount of flexion to reduce strain on the joints.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make sure you are breathing; do not hold your breath while you are lifting weights or stretching. Exhale while you are in the concentric contraction phase of lifting. Breathing while you are involved in a forceful contraction will reduce intrathoracic pressure. Reducing intrathoracic pressure is particularly important to those people with hypertension.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Try to achieve a balance in opposing muscle groups. If you can do a biceps curl with 20 pounds, you should be able to do a tricep extension with the same amount of weight. This type of balance in muscle groups provides greater stability in joints.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Orthopedic braces prescribed by a clinician should be worn during exercise unless otherwise prescribed. Cloth or neoprene braces provide inadequate support to joints and, at most, provide warmth and some proprioceptive stimulation. Wraps function in the same way that cloth and neoprene braces work. Gloves are critical for providing padding to the hands and for assisting in improving gripping power. Straps are excellent for relieving strain on the fingers and wrists. Taping can provide adequate support if done by a qualified trainer. Taping also provides adequate proprioceptive stimulation. Contrary to popular belief, weight belts provide inadequate support and should be used only for their proprioceptive benefits. Weightlifting belts may provide a false sense of support and may lead people to believe that they can lift excessive loads, especially during squats or dead-lifts.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hot packs can be applied to joints and muscles prior to exercising to reduce pain and to promote circulation. Cold packs can be applied after exercising to reduce inflammation; they should be applied for 20 minutes on and 20 minutes off.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear proper shoes while exercising. Try on as many pairs as possible, and pick the most comfortable pair. Try out all the various types of shoes: cross trainers, mid-tops, high-tops, tennis shoes, basketball shoes, weightlifting shoes, running shoes, walking shoes, and hiking shoes. If you wear orthoses, try the shoes on with the orthoses in place.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pick cushioned surfaces, such as carpet, grass, exercise mats, or sand, on which to exercise. Cushioned surfaces reduce the shock impact off of the joints of the lower extremities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop exercising if you experience any of the following: increased pain or swelling in muscles or joints; popping; locking; giving-way; or new onset of musculoskeletal pain, abdominal pain, groin pain, chest pain, or shortness of breath.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alternate between weightbearing and non-weightbearing exercises.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Always end an exercise session with an active cool-down. An active cool-down will reduce the onset of delayed muscle soreness, will slowly decrease an elevated heart rate, and will prevent blood from pooling in lower extremities, which can lead to dizziness. Stretching at the end of a workout session is also advisable.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H618272407\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
