A similar lesion also can be observed in chronic epilepsy and other processes that injure the hippocampus.

With the exception of individuals with specific mutations that cause frontotemporal dementia, it is not clear whether TDP-43-immunoreactive inclusions in these other neurodegenerative diseases are a primary, secondary, or coincidental event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Some evidence suggests that hippocampal TDP-43 deposition is associated with faster clinical progression and hippocampal atrophy among patients with AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/20,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22,23</a>].

Amyloid beta peptides are produced by the endoproteolytic cleavage of mature protein translated from the amyloid precursor protein (<em>APP</em>) gene and cleaved by beta-secretase and gamma-secretase. Presenilin forms part of the gamma-secretase complex, and mutations in presenilin 1 (<em>PSEN1</em>) or presenilin 2 (<em>PSEN2</em>) appear to favor production of amyloid beta overall, or more neurotoxic forms of amyloid beta. The ultimate neurotoxin in AD is debated, but experimental evidence highlights small aggregates of amyloid beta peptides called oligomers, as opposed to larger aggregates called fibrils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-of-alzheimer-disease#H2663399\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics of Alzheimer disease&quot;, section on 'Presenilin 1'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-of-alzheimer-disease#H2663406\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics of Alzheimer disease&quot;, section on 'Presenilin 2'</a>.)</p><p>The pathogenesis of AD also involves a second protein, tau. Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that aids in microtubule assembly and stabilization. In AD, tau becomes hyperphosphorylated and aggregates to form paired helical filament (PHF) tau, a major component of neurofibrillary tangles within the neuronal cytoplasm. The accumulation of this altered protein is toxic to neurons in experimental models. In addition, transmission of pathologic forms of tau between neurons has been proposed to account for the spread of AD in the brain, which follows a distinct progression across brain regions as AD advances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>].</p><p>There are several other important and potentially overlapping pathways likely involved in AD pathogenesis, many of which have been implicated by the various risk genes that have been identified. As an example, the human apolipoprotein E (<em>APOE</em>) gene is a pleiotropic lipoprotein involved in multiple cellular processes including cholesterol transport, development, synaptic plasticity, and immune regulation, among others. There are three alleles of <em>APOE, </em>called epsilon 2 (e2), e3, and e4, and their encoded isoforms also vary in several activities. At least one mechanism by which inheritance of the <em>APOE</em> e4 may increase AD risk is by impairing amyloid beta clearance from cerebrum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-of-alzheimer-disease#H899448\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics of Alzheimer disease&quot;, section on 'Apolipoprotein E'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H617807622\"><span class=\"h1\">CASE DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A definitive diagnosis of AD requires histopathologic examination, but most epidemiologic studies of AD rely on clinical criteria to define cases. The clinical criteria for a diagnosis of probable AD have changed over time, and much of the older literature has either not distinguished between AD and other forms of dementia or utilized relatively small case-control type studies in selected populations. Current clinical criteria for the diagnosis of AD are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease#H406198512\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of Alzheimer disease&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Epidemiologic studies will continue to evolve with the adoption of more sensitive and specific clinical criteria for AD and the incorporation of techniques for in vivo measurement of neuropathology such as amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), which will allow for more precise antemortem diagnoses. The cost of these new technologies poses challenges for the development of large-scale epidemiologic studies, however, limiting sample sizes and selectivity of the populations being studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/2,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,29,30</a>].

Based on information from several large, population-based clinicopathologic studies in older adults, the following observations can be made about the relationship between brain pathology and antemortem risk factors for AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/31-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-40</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a very high correlation between a clinical antemortem diagnosis of AD and postmortem measures of AD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately one-third of individuals over the age of 85 years who die without antemortem diagnoses of dementia or AD have pathology consistent with AD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebrovascular disease is very common among persons who die with dementia, and the presence of AD pathology and brain vascular disease together is common among individuals who die with dementia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In older subjects, the risk of dementia is associated with less AD pathology when there is concomitant vascular disease or a higher presence of Lewy bodies.

Globally, an estimated 47 million people are affected by dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>In the United States in 2011, there were an estimated 4.5 million individuals over the age of 65 years living with clinical AD; this included 0.7 million people age 65 to 74 years, 2.3 million age 75 to 84, and 1.8 million 85 years and older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. This figure is projected to rise to 13.8 million in the United States and &gt;130 million worldwide by 2050. The age-standardized prevalence of dementia ranges from 5 to 7 percent in most developed countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/42,45,47-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,45,47-50</a>]. </p><p>Estimates of the incidence of dementia vary across studies and depend heavily on age. In general, the incidence of dementia doubles every 10 years after age 60 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In the longitudinal Cardiovascular Health Study Cognition Study (CHS-CS), only 19 of 160 participants alive at age 93 years remained free of mild cognitive impairment or dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. There is very little sex difference in incidence and prevalence of dementia or AD, although by absolute numbers there are more women than men with the disease, particularly over the age of 85 years, due to differences in life expectancy. </p><p>In 24 longitudinal studies, the age-specific incidence of dementia ranged from as low as 5 of 1000 for individuals age 65 to 70 years and as high as 60 to 80 of 1000 for those age 85 years and older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Examples of individual studies include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The CHS-CS followed over 3000 adults who were free of dementia at baseline over a five-year period and captured cases of AD, or a mixture of AD and vascular dementia.

In a Medicare survey of 22,896 adults age 65 years and older, 15 diseases accounted for 70 percent of all deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Dementia was second to heart failure as a leading cause of mortality, accounting for 19 percent of the deaths. Traditional mortality statistics are not a good measure of deaths attributed to dementia, however; these figures underestimate the contribution of dementia to mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. While individuals do not die of AD per se, advanced disease increases vulnerability for other disorders, commonly infections, which ultimately lead to death. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6035902\"><span class=\"h2\">Temporal trends</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple studies have reported that the prevalence of all-cause dementia may be declining over time in high-income countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/41,56-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,56-62</a>]. As an example, a population-based study in Rotterdam reported a decreased incidence of dementia in all age groups between 1990 and 2000 as well as an increase in brain volume as a percent of intracranial volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. In another study using data from the Framingham Heart Study in the United States, the cumulative five-year hazard rate of dementia fell from 3.6 per 100 persons during the late 1970s to 2.0 per 100 persons in the late 2000s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. The magnitude of the decline was greater for vascular dementia than for AD dementia, and rates of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and stroke also fell over the same time period. Possible reasons for such a trend include improved educational levels of the more recent birth cohorts who are reaching the age of dementia risk, or improved prevention and treatment of risk factors for vascular disease. By contrast, age-adjusted mortality rates from AD specifically have risen in the United States over the last decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>It remains possible that the apparent decline in overall dementia is an artifact introduced by the definition of dementia as a specific level of cognitive impairment, especially memory, and related disability, rather than a relative change. Better-educated, cognitively higher-functioning individuals can tolerate a greater extent of neuropathologic change prior to reaching the threshold of dementia (this concept is termed &quot;cognitive reserve&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. If dementia is defined as a change in cognition to below an absolute level and education improves over time, the prevalence of dementia may appear to decline when the only thing that has changed is the initial (higher) level of education. In support of this, a population-based study in the northern United States found no change in the incidence of dementia over time in a relatively homogenous higher-educated population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H617807644\"><span class=\"h2\">Early-onset dementia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AD is also prevalent in younger adults with dementia, although there are fewer population-based studies in individuals under the age of 65 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>].</p><p>A study from the United Kingdom estimated that the incidence of dementia in individuals age 30 to 65 years was approximately 54 per 100,000 person-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. The most common causes of dementia in these patients were AD (34 percent), vascular dementia (18 percent), frontotemporal dementia (12 percent), dementia with Lewy bodies (7 percent), alcohol-related dementia (10 percent), and others (19 percent). A separate population-based study in England reported an incidence of AD of 4.2 cases per 100,000 person-years among individuals aged 45 to 64 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H617807659\"><span class=\"h1\">PRESYMPTOMATIC PERIOD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a long presymptomatic period between the onset of biochemical changes in the brain and the development of clinical symptoms of AD, suggesting that long-term epidemiologic studies beginning at an early age are needed to properly study the gene-lifestyle environmental determinants of amyloid vascular disease and neurodegeneration. In the Rotterdam Study, for example, the average age at diagnosis of dementia was 82 years, and memory complaints in these patients began 16 years before diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. </p><p>The long presymptomatic period has also been demonstrated in families with dominantly inherited AD due to genetic mutations in amyloid precursor protein (<em>APP</em>), presenilin 1 (<em>PSEN1</em>), or presenilin 2 (<em>PSEN2</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,72</a>]. Such mutations carry a nearly 100 percent risk of early-onset AD, which is typically diagnosed between 35 and 50 years of age, depending on the family. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-of-alzheimer-disease#H6562978\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics of Alzheimer disease&quot;, section on 'Early-onset Alzheimer disease'</a>.) </p><p>In a representative study performed by the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network (DIAN), 88 carriers were evaluated at a mean age of 39 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Parental age at onset of AD in the index cases was used to estimate the relationship between disease biomarkers and the onset of clinical AD.

The genetic basis for AD is understood most clearly in the early-onset form, which accounts for less than 1 percent of cases. Early-onset AD follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern related to mutations in genes that alter amyloid beta protein production, aggregation, or clearance, including amyloid precursor protein (<em>APP</em>), presenilin 1 (<em>PSEN1</em>), and presenilin 2 (<em>PSEN2</em>). Such mutations are highly penetrant, meaning that carriers have a nearly 100 percent chance of developing the disease in their lifetime.</p><p>Other early-onset cases without mutations can present clinically prior to 65 years of age.

The most firmly established genetic risk factor for late-onset AD is <em>APOE</em>; carriers of one e4 allele are at two- to threefold increased odds of developing AD compared with noncarriers, and those with two e4 alleles are at approximately 8- to 12-fold increased odds. The strength of the association may be modified by several factors, including gender, race, and vascular risk factors.

(See <a href=\"#H1817000228\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While the pathogenesis of AD remains unclear, all forms of AD appear to share overproduction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> decreased clearance of a family of proteins known as amyloid beta peptides. The pathogenesis of AD also involves tau, a microtubule-associated protein that aids in microtubule assembly. (See <a href=\"#H1817000645\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A definitive diagnosis of AD requires histopathologic examination. Clinical criteria for the diagnosis of AD have evolved over time, and the ability to accurately diagnosis AD has improved with the development of techniques for in vivo measurement of neuropathology. The diagnosis of AD requires a decline in both cognition, especially memory, and function, as well as specific neuropathology. (See <a href=\"#H617807622\" class=\"local\">'Case definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AD is increasingly prevalent with advancing age, and the overall burden of AD is substantial worldwide. The age-standardized prevalence of dementia ranges from 5 to 7 percent in most regions of the world. It has been estimated that the global prevalence of dementia will rise to &gt;100 million by 2050. (See <a href=\"#H617807629\" class=\"local\">'Incidence and prevalence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a long presymptomatic period between the onset of biochemical changes in the brain and the development of clinical symptoms of AD, suggesting that long-term epidemiologic studies beginning at an early age are needed to properly study the gene-lifestyle environmental determinants of amyloid vascular disease and neurodegeneration. (See <a href=\"#H617807659\" class=\"local\">'Presymptomatic period'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aside from age, the most clearly established risk factors for AD are a family history of dementia, rare dominantly inherited mutations in genes that impact amyloid in the brain, and the apolipoprotein E (<em>APOE</em>) epsilon 4 (e4) allele. (See <a href=\"#H14394698\" class=\"local\">'Genetic risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors for vascular disease, including hypertension, obesity, and diabetes, may increase the risk of AD, particularly when they are present in midlife. The pathogenic mechanisms linking various cardiometabolic factors and AD are not well understood, and both vascular and nonvascular mechanisms may be involved. (See <a href=\"#H3865688594\" class=\"local\">'Hypertension'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1663908081\" class=\"local\">'Type 2 diabetes and obesity'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brain cholesterol metabolism may be an important determinant of AD. The relationship between diet, genetics, blood lipoproteins levels, and AD is complex and inconsistent. (See <a href=\"#H1663907706\" class=\"local\">'Dyslipidemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebrovascular disease and AD frequently coexist. Hypertension is the primary risk factor for brain vascular disease. Cerebrovascular disease is associated with worse cognitive performance in patients with AD, and clinicopathologic studies suggest that cerebrovascular disease lowers the threshold for clinical dementia in patients with a neuropathologic diagnosis of AD. (See <a href=\"#H14394778\" class=\"local\">'Cerebrovascular disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Accumulating data suggest that social, mental, and physical activities are inversely associated with the risk of AD and other forms of dementia, and there is considerable interest in their potential as preventive strategies.
