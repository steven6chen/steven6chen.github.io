This syndrome is associated with an increased risk of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, a characteristic life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia also known as torsades de pointes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F53891%7ECARD%2F73827\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef53891 graphicRef73827 \">waveform 2A-B</a>). The primary symptoms in patients with LQTS include palpitations, syncope, seizures, and sudden cardiac death.</p><p>LQTS may be either congenital or acquired. These two primary syndromes (congenital and acquired LQTS) may be related, as some patients who develop acquired LQTS may have an inherited predisposition with abnormalities in repolarization that represent the forme fruste of LQTS. Acquired LQTS usually results from drug therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57431\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57431 \">table 1</a>), although hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and bradycardia can increase the risk of drug-induced LQTS.

The evaluation of all patients with suspected acquired LQTS includes a thorough history, including medications and recent changes in medications, along with a 12-lead ECG and bloodwork (which includes serum electrolytes, particularly potassium and magnesium, as well as a toxicology screen). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2803263656\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the absence of arrhythmias, patients with acquired LQTS will be asymptomatic. When an arrhythmia develops, the type and intensity of symptoms, if present, will vary depending upon the rate and duration of the torsades de pointes (TdP) along with the presence or absence of significant comorbid conditions. Patients with acquired LQTS who notice symptoms typically present with one or more of the following symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpitations</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Syncope or presyncope</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sudden cardiac arrest</p><p/><p>Most commonly, symptomatic patients will be lightheaded or presyncopal and may or may not report palpitations. If the ventricular tachyarrhythmia rate is fast <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the duration of the episode is sustained, this can lead to hypotension and associated hemodynamic compromise, and patients may experience syncope. While TdP is frequently self-terminating, if the arrhythmia persists, patients may present with sudden cardiac arrest.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1298033160\"><span class=\"h2\">ECG findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with suspected acquired LQTS should have a 12-lead ECG performed. The QT interval should be measured manually on all available ECGs (including old ECGs for comparison, when available) using multiple leads (preferably leads II and V5) and then corrected for heart rate. The 2011 American Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/American</span> College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">(AHA/ACC)</span> scientific statement on prevention of TdP in hospital settings recommended that a QTc over the 99th percentile should be considered abnormally prolonged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-long-qt-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This corresponds to a QTc of &gt;470 milliseconds for men and &gt;480 milliseconds for women. A QTc &gt;500 milliseconds is considered highly abnormal for both men and women.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4278736222\"><span class=\"h3\">Normal QTc ranges and general ECG principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overall, the average QTc in healthy persons after puberty is 420&plusmn;20 milliseconds. In general, the 99th percentile QTc values are 470 milliseconds in postpubertal males and 480 milliseconds in postpubertal females. The QT interval varies inversely with the heart rate; therefore, the QT measurement is adjusted for the heart rate, resulting in the corrected QT interval, or QTc. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-long-qt-syndrome-diagnosis#H3406673\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital long QT syndrome: Diagnosis&quot;, section on 'QT rate correction'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measuring the QT interval &ndash; The computer-derived QTc should always be confirmed or corrected manually. The QT interval is measured from the onset of the QRS complex to the point at which the T wave ends or tangent if the end cannot be precisely determined (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77018\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef77018 \">waveform 1</a>). Accurate measurements can be technically challenging, largely due to difficulties in clearly identifying the end of the T wave. The QT interval should be measured in multiple beats and in several leads. The technique of measuring the QT interval is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-st-and-t-wave-changes#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: ST and T wave changes&quot;, section on 'Prolonged Q-T interval'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impact of U waves &ndash; Identifying the termination of the T wave can be particularly difficult when a prominent U wave is present. The U wave should not be included if it is distinct from and smaller than 50 percent of the T wave. Erroneous inclusion of the U wave in the QT interval measurement can lead to overdiagnosis of LQTS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-long-qt-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Which lead should be used? &ndash; QT intervals vary significantly among leads [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-long-qt-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Most normal reference ranges are based upon measurements from lead II, and lead V5 is often favored because of the clarity of T wave termination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-long-qt-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H320936640\"><span class=\"h3\">QT rate correction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Under normal circumstances, the duration of repolarization depends upon the heart rate. The QT interval is longer at slower rates and shorter at faster rates. For this reason, formulas have been developed to &quot;correct&quot; the QT interval for heart rate (or the duration of the RR interval), although none are ideal (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-qt-interval-correction-ekg\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-long-qt-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. The most commonly used rate correction formula was developed by Bazett [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-long-qt-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]: </p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;QTc = QT interval &divide; &radic;RR interval (in sec)</p></div></div><p>Although this approach is simple and generally accurate, it is less accurate at heart rate extremes and results in overcorrecting at high heart rates and undercorrecting at low heart rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-long-qt-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Normative values are available for newborns and older children, which are standardized by age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-long-qt-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Ideally, the diagnosis is made following review of a full 12-lead ECG, but sometimes a single-lead rhythm strip is adequate if a full 12-lead ECG cannot be obtained.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4057249808\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial management of patients with torsades de pointes (TdP) varies depending on the hemodynamic stability of the patient. Emergency management is required in unstable patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73862\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73862 \">algorithm 1</a>), while additional time may be spent determining the etiology and treating any underlying precipitating factors in patients who are hemodynamically stable (although treatment for such patients should usually be promptly administered). Following initial management and stabilization of the patient, subsequent management of the patient will be guided by the initial presentation (ie, hemodynamically stable or unstable) and the initial approach to treatment.</p><p>The cornerstone of the management of patients with acquired LQTS is addressing the underlying cause by identifying and stopping any precipitating drug(s) and aggressive correction of any metabolic abnormalities, such as hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-long-qt-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Correcting hypokalemia may be particularly important because a low serum potassium concentration enhances the degree of drug-induced inhibition of IKr, increasing the QT interval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-long-qt-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

As an example, a bradycardia usually is associated with TdP in acquired LQTS, whereas catecholamine surges trigger TdP in some types of congenital LQTS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64239\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64239 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Magnesium</strong> &ndash; IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium sulfate</a> is first-line therapy, being highly effective for both the treatment and prevention of recurrence of long QT-related ventricular ectopic beats or TdP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-long-qt-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. The benefit occurs without shortening of the QT interval and is seen even in patients with normal serum magnesium concentrations at baseline.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The standard regimen for an adult consists of a 2 gram IV bolus of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium sulfate</a> (4 mL of 50% solution [ie, 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL]</span> mixed with D5W to a total volume of 10 mL or more) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-long-qt-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. The rate of magnesium infusion depends on the clinical situation. In patients with pulseless cardiac arrest, infusion occurs over one to two minutes; in patients without cardiac arrest, infusion should occur over 15 minutes as rapid magnesium infusion may be associated with hypotension and asystole. Some patients also receive a continuous infusion at a rate of 3 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/min</span>.

Additionally, patients with a pre-existing permanent pacemaker may have the device reprogrammed to increase the pacing rate, while patients with a pre-existing implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) may have the ICD reprogrammed to a prolonged detection time, thereby delaying ICD shock for episodes of TdP that may self-terminate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Pacing at rates of approximately 100 beats per minute will decrease the dispersion of refractoriness and the development of early afterdepolarizations, and may shorten the surface QT interval, especially if there is an associated bradycardia. Many of the class IA and class III antiarrhythmic drugs that cause TdP have a property of &quot;reverse use dependency,&quot; in which the QT interval decreases as the heart rate increases and lengthens as the heart rate slows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-long-qt-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-long-qt-syndrome-definitions-causes-and-pathophysiology#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired long QT syndrome: Definitions, causes, and pathophysiology&quot;, section on 'Torsades de pointes'</a>).

Some patients with acquired LQTS have an underlying &quot;forme fruste&quot; of congenital LQTS. (See <a href=\"#H2156786952\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical presentation of acquired LQTS is variable; many patients are asymptomatic and identified solely by QT prolongation on the electrocardiogram (ECG), while a minority are symptomatic and present with palpitations, syncope, or sudden cardiac arrest. The evaluation of all patients with suspected acquired LQTS includes a thorough history, including medications and recent changes in medications, along with a 12-lead ECG and bloodwork (which includes serum electrolytes, particularly potassium and magnesium, as well as a toxicology screen). (See <a href=\"#H181101695\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation and evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of acquired LQTS can be made in a patient with sufficient QT prolongation on the surface ECG in association with a medication or other clinical scenario (ie, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia) associated with QT prolongation.
