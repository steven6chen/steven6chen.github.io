The apparatus for measurement of pleural pressure is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-pleural-pressure#H25576496\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of pleural pressure&quot;, section on 'Equipment'</a>.)</p><p>For measurement of pleural pressures and elastance, the patient should be in an upright sitting position with his or her arms resting on a surface such as a bedside table. When available, thoracic ultrasound is employed to confirm the location of the pleural effusion and select a dependent portion that is above the level of the diaphragm through all phases of the respiratory cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-volume-thoracentesis/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. The exact puncture site should be immediately above the superior aspect of a rib to avoid the neurovascular bundle and, when possible, 8 to 10 cm lateral to the spine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thoracic-ultrasound-indications-advantages-and-technique\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thoracic ultrasound: Indications, advantages, and technique&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasound-guided-thoracentesis#H3730160663\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasound-guided thoracentesis&quot;, section on 'Choosing and marking the needle site'</a>.)</p><p>Without moving the patient, a wide area surrounding the puncture site is sterilized with 0.05 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a> or 10 percent povidone-iodine solution, and sterile drapes are placed around the site. Local anesthetic (eg, 1 or 2 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>) is administered to the site as for diagnostic thoracentesis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasound-guided-thoracentesis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasound-guided thoracentesis&quot;, section on 'Site preparation and local anesthesia'</a>.)</p><p>A thoracentesis catheter (eg, 8 French catheter over an 18-gauge 7.5 inch [19 cm] needle) with a 50 mL syringe attached via a stopcock is inserted, advanced to the rib, and then moved cephalad by 1 to 2 mm increments until the catheter can be advanced up and over the superior edge of the rib. As the needle is advanced, aspiration is attempted by intermittently pulling back on the plunger of the syringe approximately every 2 to 3 mm. When pleural fluid is returned, the catheter is passed over the needle into the pleural space and the needle withdrawn. A sample of 50 to 60 mL of pleural fluid is obtained as needed for diagnostic testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasound-guided-thoracentesis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasound-guided thoracentesis&quot;, section on 'Fluid removal'</a>.)</p><p>The initial pleural pressure measurement is obtained after removal of the sample for diagnostic testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F69925\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69925 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F58189\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58189 \">picture 1</a>). Subsequent measurements of pleural pressure are obtained and recorded after each aliquot (eg, 100 to 250 mL) of pleural fluid is removed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-volume-thoracentesis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. We typically remove fluid using a syringe and tubing connected via a stopcock to a collection bag, rather than to vacuum bottles, to avoid local application of excess negative pressure to an area of the pleura and to allow removal of more exact volumes of pleural fluid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F69925\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69925 \">figure 2</a>). The measurement and interpretation of pleural pressures are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-pleural-pressure#H933967\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of pleural pressure&quot;, section on 'Technique'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25575612\"><span class=\"h1\">DETERMINING THE VOLUME OF FLUID TO BE REMOVED</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The maximum volume of fluid that can be safely removed during therapeutic thoracentesis is uncertain because the occurrence of re-expansion pulmonary edema and procedure-related pneumothorax do not clearly correlate with the onset of symptoms or the volume of fluid removed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-volume-thoracentesis/abstract/2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6</a>]. A traditional method to avoid these complications has been to discontinue fluid removal at the onset of chest discomfort or when the total amount of fluid removed reaches 1000 to 1500 mL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-volume-thoracentesis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, this practice does not always prevent adverse effects and, in fact, many patients do well with removal of more than 1500 mL.</p><p>An alternative method, which we prefer, combines symptom monitoring with serial measures of pleural pressure to determine a &ldquo;safe&rdquo; volume of fluid to remove; fluid removal is stopped if the patient develops chest discomfort or becomes hypotensive, if no more fluid can be aspirated, or if the pleural pressure decreases to less than -20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-volume-thoracentesis/abstract/1,3,7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,7-10</a>]. Evidence in favor of this method comes from the following observations (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-pleural-pressure#H934253\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of pleural pressure&quot;, section on 'Pressure measurement'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The onset of vague chest discomfort correlates with development of more negative pleural pressures and is a sign that fluid removal should be discontinued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-volume-thoracentesis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In a series of 169 patients, onset of chest discomfort was associated with lower (more negative) closing pressures and a greater total change in pleural pressure, while cough did not correlate with lower pressures or the change in pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-volume-thoracentesis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Among those who developed chest discomfort, only 22 percent had a potentially unsafe decrease in pleural pressure, suggesting that stopping fluid removal at the onset of chest discomfort avoided &ldquo;unsafe&rdquo; pleural pressures in the majority. Measuring pleural fluid pressure during thoracentesis (pleural manometry) provides an objective method to monitor the safety and benefit of ongoing fluid removal. Based on animal studies and observational studies in patients, the more negative the pleural pressure after fluid removal, the greater the risk of complications such as re-expansion pulmonary edema or post-procedure pneumothorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-volume-thoracentesis/abstract/1,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8,9</a>]. In a series of 185 large volume thoracenteses, pleural fluid pressure was monitored and fluid removal stopped at the onset of chest discomfort or a pleural pressure of less than -20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-volume-thoracentesis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The mean amount of fluid removed was 1670 mL and the range 1000 to 6550 mL. Only one patient developed significant re-expansion pulmonary edema, lending some support to the value of monitoring pleural pressure during large volume thoracentesis. (See <a href=\"#H25575633\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>If a patient experiences persistent anterior vague chest discomfort, it is most likely due to negative pleural pressure, we typically introduce ambient air (eg, 10 to 20 mL aliquots until discomfort relieved) into the pleural space. This usually relieves the discomfort immediately. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25575626\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSMENT AFTER FLUID REMOVAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postprocedural ultrasound or radiographic imaging is performed to determine whether a pneumothorax has developed and the amount of residual pleural fluid. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thoracic-ultrasound-indications-advantages-and-technique\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thoracic ultrasound: Indications, advantages, and technique&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For patients with a pleural pressure at the end of thoracentesis that is &lt;-20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O or an abnormally high elastance (&gt;14.5 cm H<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">O/L),</span> an air contrast computed tomography scan of the chest is sometimes obtained to verify the presence of visceral pleural thickening as a cause of trapped lung physiology. The technique of air contrast computed tomography of the pleura is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-management-of-pleural-causes-of-unexpandable-lung#H25147598\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and management of pleural causes of unexpandable lung&quot;, section on 'Imaging'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25578795\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECT ON PULMONARY FUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The degree of improvement in pulmonary function following large volume thoracentesis does not correlate well with the volume of fluid withdrawn [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-volume-thoracentesis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In a series of 26 thoracenteses, the improvement in the forced vital capacity (FVC) was small relative to the amount of fluid withdrawn [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-volume-thoracentesis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. After the removal of 800 mL pleural fluid, patients with higher (less negative) pleural pressures and those with smaller decreases in the pleural pressure had greater improvements in their pulmonary functions after thoracentesis. This observation suggests that patients with more negative pleural pressure had unexpandable lung that limited the benefit of fluid removal.

The mechanisms by which the lung undergoes re-expansion pulmonary edema are complex and controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-volume-thoracentesis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. These mechanisms could include direct injury from a surfactant dysfunction in chronic atelectatic lung; and increased transpleural pressures when excessively negative pleural pressures are created during fluid removal in the setting of an unexpandable lung or indirect injury from reperfusion. </p><p>Symptomatic re-expansion pulmonary edema is an uncommon complication of large volume thoracentesis, occurring in less than 1 percent of procedures, [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-volume-thoracentesis/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>], while asymptomatic radiographic evidence of pulmonary edema (eg, diffuse ground glass opacities usually on the side of the thoracentesis) is slightly more common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-volume-thoracentesis/abstract/3,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,16</a>]. Symptoms and radiographic abnormalities typically resolve over 24 to 48 hours. Management is largely supportive with supplemental oxygen and cardiopulmonary monitoring.

Compared to a thoracentesis of 0.8-1.2 L, drainage of 1.8-2.2 L was associated with a more than threefold increase in risk for pneumothorax (odds ratio [OR] 3.8, 95% CI 1.28-11.2) and, after drainage of 2.3 L or more, the increase in risk was almost sixfold (OR 5.7, 95% CI 1.30-24.7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-volume-thoracentesis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The specific causes of pneumothorax complicating large volume thoracentesis include iatrogenic lung puncture, inadvertent introduction of air during the procedure, and pneumothorax ex vacuo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-volume-thoracentesis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25578852\"><span class=\"h2\">Pneumothorax ex vacuo</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pneumothorax ex vacuo refers to the development of a pneumothorax due to strongly negative pleural pressure created during pleural fluid removal. The causes of pneumothorax ex vacuo are attributed to an unexpandable lung and include chronic atelectasis, endobronchial obstruction, and visceral pleural restriction due to either a trapped lung or lung entrapment by an inflammatory or malignant process.</p><p>The mechanism of pneumothorax ex vacuo is unknown but may be due to the strongly negative pressure pulling air into the pleural space along the chest wall tract or alternatively, across the visceral pleura of the lung without creation of a lung puncture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-volume-thoracentesis/abstract/1,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,18</a>].</p><p>Of note, postprocedure radiographs of a pneumothorax ex vacuo may show ipsilateral volume loss (rather than an unchanged or increased volume of the hemithorax), and the pneumothorax may be located at the base of the lung in the area where pleural fluid was withdrawn. Small, asymptomatic postprocedure pneumothoraces can usually be managed conservatively with observation. Tube thoracostomy should be considered if the pneumothorax is large, progressive, the patient is symptomatic, or the patient is mechanically ventilated.
