(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-the-hematopoietic-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of the hematopoietic neoplasms&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The molecular pathogenesis of DLBCL is a complex, multistep process that ultimately results in the transformation and expansion of a malignant clone of germinal or post-germinal B cell origin. While some steps in this pathway have been elucidated, many remain unknown. The best-characterized oncogenic events are acquired genetic lesions (eg, rearrangements of <em>BCL6</em>,<em> BCL2</em>,<em> </em>and<em> MYC</em>), many of which are also seen in other NHL variants. This may reflect in part the not uncommon evolution of low-grade lymphoma into DLBCL. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of diffuse large B cell lymphoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=histologic-transformation-of-follicular-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Histologic transformation of follicular lymphoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=richters-transformation-in-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia-small-lymphocytic-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Richter's transformation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The following sections will describe genetic changes, aberrant gene and protein expression, and other alterations that are thought to play a role in the development of DLBCL. It is increasingly appreciated that the diagnostic category of &quot;DLBCL&quot; is heterogeneous in terms of morphology, genetics, and biologic behavior. The 2016 World Health Organization classification of lymphoid neoplasms recommends that immunohistochemistry <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> gene expression profiling be used to subclassify &quot;typical&quot; DLBCL into tumors of germinal center and non-germinal center origin, in recognition that these two classes of tumors have different prognoses with current therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma-and-primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Most of the non-germinal center tumors fall into a specific category, termed the activated B cell (ABC) type, so named based on a resemblance in terms of gene expression to normal activated B cells, whereas others into an unclassifiable category. In addition, a number of clinicopathologic entities are recognized that are sufficiently distinct to be considered separate diagnostic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> therapeutic categories:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T cell rich large B cell lymphoma.

The germinal center or post-germinal center ancestry of these cells is principally supported by the identification of somatic mutations in the variable region of the immunoglobulin genes (<em>IgVH</em>), which serves as a marker of germinal center transit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma-and-primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The majority of cases also demonstrate ongoing somatic mutations, which reflect the pressure of antigen selection associated with post-germinal center lymphocytes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F80736\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80736 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma-and-primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-b-and-t-lymphocyte-development\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal B and T lymphocyte development&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Additional information regarding the cell of origin is derived from gene expression profile analyses described in more detail below. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Gene expression heterogeneity of DLBCL'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ABERRANT BCL6 EXPRESSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) tumors express the B cell lymphoma 6 (<em>BCL6</em>) gene, which encodes a transcriptional repressor. In normal B cells, BCL6 negatively regulates its own expression by binding to the <em>BCL6</em> promoter. Persistent expression in DLBCL is the result either of acquired mutations in the <em>BCL6</em> promoter that prevent BCL6 binding or of translocations that place <em>BCL6</em> under the control of a new promoter that is not subject to BCL6 autoregulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma-and-primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Overexpression of BCL6 in B cell lymphoma cells leads to downregulation of <em>BCL6</em> target genes, including the <em>TP53</em> tumor suppressor gene, which may be one way in which BCL6 protects cells from undergoing apoptosis in response to DNA damage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F62109\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62109 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>The combined frequency of <em>BCL6</em> mutations and rearrangements approaches 100 percent in DLBCL cases, suggesting that structural alterations of the 5' noncoding region of the <em>BCL6</em> gene are necessary for the development of these tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma-and-primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">BCL6 action</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The B cell lymphoma 6 (<em>BCL6</em>) gene, located at band 3q27, encodes a 95 kD nuclear phosphoprotein of the BTB-POZ transcription factor family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma-and-primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. BCL6 contains six zinc-finger motifs, which bind to its DNA recognition sequence, a POZ transrepression domain, and a second repression domain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma-and-primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The net effect is that BCL6 is a potent repressor of transcription [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma-and-primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In addition to regulation of genes with <em>BCL6</em> binding sites, BCL6 can also mediate repression of genes that lack <em>BCL6</em> binding sites by associating with other DNA-binding factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma-and-primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">BCL6 in normal cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>BCL6 is expressed in mature germinal center B cells, but not in their differentiated cell progeny (plasma cells and memory B cells). It acts as a transcription repressor for many genes, including the <em>BCL6</em> gene.</p><p>Overexpression of BCL6 in B cell lymphoma cell lines prevents the cells from undergoing apoptosis in response to DNA damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma-and-primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. It is hypothesized that BCL6 expression permits the DNA strand breaks that are required for normal somatic hypermutation and class switching to proceed in the germinal center without triggering apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma-and-primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. BCL6 may do so by suppressing the expression and activity of multiple components of the DNA damage response, including TP53 (an effector of apoptosis in response to DNA damage) and ATR, ATM, and CHK1 (DNA damage checkpoint proteins) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma-and-primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. BCL6 expression must subsequently be downregulated before the cell can progress to the post-germinal center phase of development, during which further DNA damage must be minimized. Signals that induce lymphocyte differentiation downregulate BCL6, a process that is probably required for normal B cells to exit the germinal center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma-and-primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].</p><p>BCL6 knockout mice cannot form germinal centers and have impaired T-cell-dependent antibody responses, indicating that BCL6 is required for germinal center formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma-and-primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Transgenic mice have been engineered to overexpress BCL6 from the immunoglobulin heavy chain promoter, thereby mimicking the (3;14) translocation seen in human DLBCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma-and-primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. These mice show increased germinal center formation and 75 to 90 percent develop a lymphoproliferative disorder that frequently progresses to a DLBCL-like lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma-and-primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">BCL6 dysregulation in DLBCL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As mentioned above, the <em>BCL6</em> gene is expressed in most cases of DLBCL. In some instances, this may merely reflect the stage of B cell differentiation at which the tumor cells arrest, but in approximately 30 percent of DLBCL it is the consequence of a translocation that places the gene under the control of a new promoter. In an additional subset of cases, BCL6 expression stems from or is enhanced by a mutation in the <em>BCL6</em> gene promoter that interferes with the BCL6-dependent negative autoregulatory loop for this gene. Persistent expression or overexpression of BCL6 results in several alterations in germinal center (GC) B cells that are believed to contribute to lymphomagenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma-and-primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>], including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhibition of cell cycle arrest, via repression of factors such as cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Modulation of apoptosis through effects on BCL2 and caspases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dampening the DNA-damage response through downregulation of TP53 and DNA damage checkpoint factors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Promotion of expression of activation-induced cytosine deaminase (AID), an enzyme that contributes to genomic instability by participating directly in somatic hypermutation.

They are frequently independent of translocation to immunoglobulin (Ig) loci, occurring in the absence of any recognizable chromosomal abnormality affecting band 3q27 or rearrangement of the BCL6 locus. The mutations are often single base substitutions, most commonly transitions, and bear the molecular signature of mutations that are induced by AID as part of the normal process of somatic hypermutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma-and-primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].

In a minority of cases, the chromosomal breakpoint is not located in the immediate proximity of the <em>BCL6</em> gene, suggesting that more distant breakpoint clusters exist.

Furthermore, the location of the mutation within the TP53 protein appeared to be important, with DNA binding domain mutations associated with the worst outcome, followed by mutations of the Loop-Sheet-Helix and Loop-L3. Mutations in Loop-L2 did not affect survival. The presence of a DNA binding domain mutation in <em>TP53</em> was an independent predictor of survival, suggesting that these mutations are important either in DLBCL pathogenesis or in DLBCL susceptibility to chemotherapy.</p><p>TP53 activates the p21 cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor. Expression of p21 appears to be an independent predictor of failure-free and overall survival in DLBCL treated with R-CHOP. As an example, a prospective intergroup trial demonstrated that the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> to standard chemotherapy had no effect on the clinical outcomes of patients with p21 negative tumors, but significantly improved the failure-free survival of patients with p21 positive tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma-and-primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1088482\"><span class=\"h1\">INSIGHTS FROM DEEP SEQUENCING OF DLBCL GENOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Deep sequencing of DNA isolated from diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma (PMBL) genomes identified &gt;150 recurrent mutations in DLBCL, most of which remain to be functionally characterized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma-and-primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Of note, some of the most frequent mutations in DLBCL involve genes that regulate histone modifications, such as <em>MLL2, MEF2B, EZH2, </em>and<em> CREBBP</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma-and-primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/30,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,37</a>], suggesting that epigenetic alterations play an important role in the pathobiology of DLBCL.

Both classes of DLBCL are equally likely to have mutations involving <em>BCL6, TP53,</em> genes that encode immunosurveillance factors, and genes that are involved in regulation of the epigenome. DLBCLs of germinal center origin are more likely to have mutations in the epigenetic regulator <em>EZH2, GNA13</em> (a putative regulator of cell motility), as well as <em>BCL2</em> translocations, whereas ABC-type DLBCLs are more often associated with mutations in genes that increase B cell receptor signaling and activation of the pro-survival transcription factor NF-kappaB, such as <em>MYD88, CD79A, CARD11, </em>and<em> TNFAIP3</em> (also known as A20). Based on whole exome sequencing of 1001 DLBCLs, a genomic risk model has been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma-and-primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]; further work is needed to determine if this model offers advantages over other current methods for stratifying DLBCL patients.</p><p>Whole genome sequencing has also demonstrated widespread genomic rearrangements and evidence of chromothripsis (ie, local chromosome shattering) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma-and-primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The order of mutation acquisition inferred from an analysis of subclonal variants within the same tumor suggests that tumors continue to acquire mutations as they evolve. Driver mutations previously thought to initiate tumorigenesis, such as <em>EZH2, MYD88, CARD11, </em>and<em> CD79A</em>, are among the genes that may also accumulate mutations as secondary events within established tumors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER MECHANISMS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Aberrant somatic hypermutation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Somatic hypermutation is the introduction of point mutations and small deletions or insertions, usually affecting the variable regions of immunoglobulin heavy chain genes of germinal center B cells.

The molecular pathogenesis of DLBCL is a complex, multistep process leading to the replication of a malignant clone of germinal or post-germinal B cell origin. While some steps in this pathway have been elucidated, many remain unknown.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DLBCL is a heterogeneous clinicopathologic entity that includes tumors derived from germinal center B cells or post-germinal center B cells (also called activated B cells) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F80736\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80736 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Cell of Origin'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Heterogeneity of DLBCL'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of DLBCL tumors demonstrates translocations or mutations that result in the increased expression of the B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) gene. Overexpression of BCL6 leads to downregulation of target genes, including the <em>TP53</em> tumor suppressor gene, which prevents the cells from undergoing apoptosis in response to DNA damage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F62109\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62109 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Aberrant BCL6 expression'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Up to 20 percent of DLBCL demonstrate mutations or deletions of the <em>TP53</em> tumor suppressor gene. In addition, <em>TP53</em> transcription is at least partially controlled by the <em>BCL6</em> gene. Downregulation of <em>TP53</em> expression or expression of mutant TP53 products results in a loss of the normal growth-limiting activities of this gene. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'TP53 downregulation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other mechanisms important in the pathogenesis of a minority of DLBCL include aberrant somatic hypermutation, BCL2 activation, and MYC overexpression, evasion of host immunity, and altered tumor cell <span class=\"nowrap\">motility/trafficking</span>. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Other mechanisms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary large B cell lymphoma of the mediastinum (PMBL) is a variant of DLBCL arising in the mediastinum from the thymic (medullary) B cell. The pathogenesis of PMBL is largely unknown, but may be more similar to that of classical Hodgkin lymphoma than that of DLBCL, and appears to involve activation of JAK-STAT and NF-KB signaling as well as acquisition of genetic lesions that allow the tumor cells to escape from immune surveillance.
