For most of them, drinking alcohol is controlled and safe. Still, 59.7 million persons (almost one quarter) reported being binge drinkers in the 30 days prior to the survey and 17 million people reported heavy drinking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-use-when-is-drinking-a-problem-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Most people have a hard time distinguishing when &quot;normal drinking&quot; becomes problem drinking. How do you know how much is too much, particularly when a small to moderate amount of alcohol might be good for you? (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risks-and-benefits-of-alcohol-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Risks and benefits of alcohol (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In general, drinking is considered a problem when it starts to adversely affect a person's personal or professional life, or when the person loses control over his or her drinking. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Definitions of drinking problems'</a> below.)</p><p>This topic will explain how healthcare providers determine if a person has a drinking problem. It also offers some screening tools you can use on yourself or a relative or friend. Topics that discuss the treatment of alcohol problems are available by subscription.

For instance:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alcohol use disorder runs in families, and certain genes make people more vulnerable to drinking problems. In fact, people who have a sibling, parent, or child who abuses alcohol have three to four times the average risk of developing a drinking problem.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While problem drinking can affect men and women of all ages and backgrounds, it is more common among men than women and is most common among those aged 18 to 25 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-use-when-is-drinking-a-problem-beyond-the-basics/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, women can have alcohol-related problems at lower drinking levels than men. If a man and a woman of the same weight drink the same amount of alcohol, the woman will have a higher level of alcohol in her blood, putting her at greater risk for harm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-use-when-is-drinking-a-problem-beyond-the-basics/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alcohol abuse is common in people older than 65 and can be especially dangerous for them; alcohol can interact with medications and is responsible for many fall-related injuries.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In young people, alcohol and drug use can lead to car crashes, suicide and homicide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-use-when-is-drinking-a-problem-beyond-the-basics/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In addition, people who begin drinking at an early age are four times more likely to develop alcoholism than those who begin drinking at or after age 21.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having another mental health problem, such as severe anxiety, depression, or a personality disorder, increases the risk of abusing alcohol. By some estimates, 37 percent of those with a drinking problem also have a mental health condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-use-when-is-drinking-a-problem-beyond-the-basics/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. That's important because treating these problems is often an integral part of overcoming alcohol addiction.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS OF DRINKING PROBLEMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Experts use many terms to describe different types of drinking problems. We will describe the terms alcohol intoxication, alcohol use disorder, problem drinking, and binge drinking.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Alcohol intoxication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alcohol intoxication occurs when drinking excess alcohol leads to inappropriate behavior and impaired judgment. Being intoxicated can cause slurred speech, loss of coordination, unsteady walking or running, difficulty paying attention or remembering, confusion, or coma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Alcohol use disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alcohol use disorder is the medical term for alcohol addiction or what most people think of as alcoholism. Alcohol use disorder can be mild to severe. People who have the disorder have two or more of the following problems. The more of these they have, the more severe their disorder. &#160; </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They end up drinking more than they planned to, or they drink longer than they planned to.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They wish they could cut down on alcohol, but they can&rsquo;t. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They spend a lot of time trying to get alcohol, getting drunk, or recovering from being drunk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They crave or have a strong desire or urge to drink. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because of their alcohol use, they often don&rsquo;t do things that are expected of them, such as go to work or school, remember family events, and clean their home.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They keep drinking even if it causes or worsens problems in their relationships or interactions with other people.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They stop or cut back on important social, work, or fun activities they used to do. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They keep drinking even in situations where it is dangerous to do so (such as while driving). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They keep drinking even when they know they have a physical or mental problem that was probably caused or made worse by their alcohol use.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They need to drink more and more to get the same effects they used to get with less use. Or they get less effect from using the amount that used to get them drunk. This is called &ldquo;tolerance.&rdquo;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They have &ldquo;withdrawal symptoms&rdquo; if they stop drinking alcohol after drinking for a long time. Withdrawal symptoms can include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sweating or a racing heart</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shaking</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insomnia (not being able to sleep)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea or vomiting </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seeing, feeling, or hearing things that aren&rsquo;t really there (this is called having hallucinations)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being restless</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anxiety</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizures </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Problem drinking</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people do not fit the criteria for alcohol use disorder, but are at risk for accidents and problems resulting from drinking too much. A significant proportion of patients seen in emergency departments or trauma centers for intentional and unintentional injuries are problem drinkers.</p><p>Problem drinkers may be moderate drinkers, heavy drinkers, or binge drinkers. The definition of these terms is based on the number of servings of alcohol that the person drinks per occasion and how often the person drinks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">What is one drink?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A standard &quot;drink&quot; in the United States contains about 0.6 fluid ounces or 14 grams of &quot;pure&quot; alcohol (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F106848\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106848 \">figure 1</a>), and is the equivalent of:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>12 ounces of regular beer</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>8-9 ounces of malt liquor</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>5 ounces of wine</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>1.5 ounces of 80 proof distilled spirits</p><p/><p>These examples may not accurately reflect actual servings, however. A mixed drink, for example, can be the equivalent of one to three or more standard drinks, depending on the recipe. Also, the alcohol content for different types of beer, wine, or malt liquor can vary greatly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Moderate drinkers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Healthy people who drink moderately have a relatively low risk of developing an alcohol problem. Moderate drinking is defined as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women: No more than one drink per day</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Men: No more than two drinks per day</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People 65 and older: No more than one drink per day</p><p/><p>People who stay within these &quot;low-risk&quot; drinking limits can still have problems if they drink too quickly, have health problems, or are taking certain prescription medications. Even moderate amounts of alcohol can impact balance, judgment, and the ability to drive, even in the absence of feeling &quot;buzzed&quot; or &quot;high&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-use-when-is-drinking-a-problem-beyond-the-basics/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Heavy drinkers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People who drink heavily have a significantly increased risk of developing alcohol problems. Heavy drinking is defined as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women: More than seven drinks per week or three drinks per occasion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Men: More than 14 drinks per week or four drinks per occasion</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Binge drinkers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People who binge drink also have a significant risk of developing an alcohol problem. Binge drinking is defined as drinking at a single occasion (generally within about two hours):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women: Four or more drinks </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Men: Five or more drinks </p><p/><p>The binge drinker is able to go days without drinking at all. However, binge drinkers do not and at times cannot limit their drinking once they have a drink. With increasing heavy drinking days over time, the risk of developing alcohol abuse or dependence grows.</p><p>Teenagers and young adults often are at particular risk of binge drinking as a consequence of peer pressure. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING AND DIAGNOSIS OF DRINKING PROBLEMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When trying to determine whether a person has a problem with alcohol, healthcare providers focus on three key things:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have you lost control of your drinking?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have you developed tolerance or other signs of addiction?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has alcohol contributed to problems such as the loss of a job, legal troubles, or problems in relationships?</p><p/><p>Still, distinguishing normal from problematic drinking requires the person to share information about their drinking and its effects on them.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening questionnaires</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Providers sometimes use one of several questionnaires that are designed to identify people who may have a drinking problem. Such questionnaires ask specific questions that have been studied and shown to help predict when a person has a problem with alcohol use. In addition, some patients may feel more comfortable providing information about drinking when asked as part of a questionnaire, or knowing that such questions are asked of all patients.</p><p>Screening questionnaires are better at detecting alcohol use disorder than questions about the quantity or frequency of drinking. That's important, because alcohol use disorder has less to do with the amount of alcohol a person drinks and more to do with the effects that drinking has on their life.</p><p>Screening questionnaires are not intended to establish a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. Rather, they identify people who should be further assessed by their clinician to determine if alcohol is a problem for them, and if they need treatment.</p><p>Some screening tools work better than others in specific groups. One of the more universally-applicable tests is described below. Other tests have been designed specifically for college students, women, and pregnant women, among other populations. A more extensive list of screening tests is available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-unhealthy-use-of-alcohol-and-other-drugs-in-primary-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for unhealthy use of alcohol and other drugs in primary care&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) asks about the amount of alcohol you consume, as well as your experience in using alcohol. A sample version of the AUDIT questionnaire is available at <a href=\"http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh28-2/78-79.htm&amp;token=ozwPR0h557C+qJfPUW7chpa0H8FDMtnAPM9PIGmZoil0Qn7oC0Hh9C+nsR9fbajH3FVWZjACbL1g1jWa2lMgKw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=2723\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh28-2/78-79.htm</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">CONSEQUENCES OF DRINKING PROBLEMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a number of serious consequences of drinking alcohol excessively:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive alcohol consumption is a leading preventable cause of death in the United States.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drinking alcohol increases the risk of traffic accidents, suicide, drowning, and other serious injuries.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alcohol use continues to be the leading cause of injuries treated in trauma centers and emergency departments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-use-when-is-drinking-a-problem-beyond-the-basics/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alcohol-related liver disease may lead to end-stage liver disease (cirrhosis) and death.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alcohol increases the risk of certain cancers of the mouth, esophagus, throat, liver, and breast.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other consequences of prolonged, heavy alcohol consumption include heart failure and several types of dementia, some of which are irreversible.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF DRINKING PROBLEMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People who have a drinking problem have a number of treatment options at their disposal, including counseling and medications.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Counseling often involves meeting with a therapist, counselor, or physician to talk. For some people, brief interventions have been shown to be very successful, especially when combined with medications. Others may benefit from more prolonged counseling.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The medications used in treating alcohol use disorder help people who are going to alcohol counseling and a peer support group to reduce their drinking. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to formal treatment, many healthcare providers recommend participating in social support groups, such as Alcoholics Anonymous.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Can I stop drinking on my own?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people successfully overcome drinking problems on their own.
