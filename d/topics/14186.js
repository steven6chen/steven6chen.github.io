In contrast, orbital cellulitis is an infection involving the contents of the orbit (fat and ocular muscles) but not the globe. Although preseptal and orbital cellulitis may be confused with one another because both can cause ocular pain and eyelid swelling and erythema, they have very different clinical implications. Preseptal cellulitis is generally a mild condition that rarely leads to serious complications, whereas orbital cellulitis may cause loss of vision and even loss of life. Orbital cellulitis can usually be distinguished from preseptal cellulitis by its clinical features (ophthalmoplegia, pain with eye movements, and proptosis) and by imaging studies. In cases in which the distinction is not clear, clinicians should treat patients as though they have orbital cellulitis. Both conditions are more common in children than in adults, and preseptal cellulitis is much more common than orbital cellulitis. </p><p>The pathogenesis, microbiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of preseptal cellulitis will be reviewed here. Orbital cellulitis and its complications, such as subperiosteal abscess and orbital abscess, are discussed separately. Orbital infections caused by fungi, mainly the <em>Mucorales</em> (which cause mucormycosis) and <em>Aspergillus</em> spp and, much more rarely, <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>, are also presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=orbital-cellulitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Orbital cellulitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mucormycosis-zygomycosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mucormycosis (zygomycosis)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-invasive-aspergillosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and clinical manifestations of invasive aspergillosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculosis-and-the-eye\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tuberculosis and the eye&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83430254\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preseptal cellulitis and orbital cellulitis involve different anatomic sites, with preseptal cellulitis referring to infections of the soft tissues anterior to the orbital septum and orbital cellulitis referring to infections posterior to it (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F68971\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68971 \">figure 1</a>). Neither infection involves the globe. (See <a href=\"#H83430261\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy'</a> below.)</p><p>There is some debate regarding the appropriate terminology for these infections. Some clinicians use the term &quot;periorbital cellulitis&quot; rather than &quot;preseptal cellulitis&quot; or use the terms interchangeably. We prefer the term &quot;preseptal cellulitis&quot; to make a clear distinction between this infection and the more serious infection, &quot;orbital cellulitis.&quot; Orbital cellulitis is sometimes referred to as &quot;postseptal cellulitis&quot;; we favor the term &quot;orbital cellulitis,&quot; and will use it throughout this topic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83430261\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Basic familiarity with the anatomy of the eye is fundamental to understanding the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and complications of preseptal and orbital cellulitis. The orbit is a cone-shaped structure, lying horizontally, with its apex in the skull. It is surrounded by paranasal sinuses, namely, the frontal (lying superior), ethmoid (medial) and maxillary (inferior) sinuses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F71411\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71411 \">figure 2</a>). The orbit is lined by periosteum. The ethmoid sinuses are separated from the orbit by a paper-thin layer called the lamina papyracea, which contains many perforations for nerves and blood vessels as well as some natural fenestrations termed Zuckerkandl's dehiscences. The most common route of infection of the orbit is by extension from the ethmoid sinuses, presumably through these perforations.</p><p>The orbital septum is a membranous sheet that extends from the periosteum of the orbit to the tarsal plate and forms the anterior boundary of the orbital compartment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F68971\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68971 \">figure 1</a>). As noted above, preseptal cellulitis involves the soft tissues anterior to the orbital septum. The superior and inferior ophthalmic veins drain blood directly into the cavernous sinus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61214\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61214 \">figure 3</a>). Because of this communication and because the inferior orbital veins are valveless, infection can pass readily from the orbit to intracranial structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preseptal-cellulitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H234333111\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preseptal cellulitis is much more common than orbital cellulitis. In two pediatric case series, 94 percent and 87 percent of cases, respectively, were diagnosed as preseptal cellulitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preseptal-cellulitis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]; the remainder of cases were diagnosed as orbital cellulitis. Both infections are much more common in children than in adults; accordingly, most of the data regarding these infections come from studies in children. </p><p>It is important to distinguish between preseptal and orbital cellulitis because the complications, treatments, and outcomes of the two entities are very different. (See <a href=\"#H83430770\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83430756\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whereas the paranasal sinuses are the main source of infection in orbital cellulitis, many cases of preseptal cellulitis (the proportion varying from study to study) arise from external sources. In one retrospective series of 315 children admitted to the hospital with preseptal or orbital cellulitis, sinusitis was the underlying condition in all 18 children with orbital cellulitis but in only 15 percent of those with preseptal cellulitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preseptal-cellulitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, other studies have found sinusitis to be the most common cause of preseptal cellulitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preseptal-cellulitis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>Other sites from which preseptal cellulitis may arise are the surrounding tissues of the face and eyelids following local trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preseptal-cellulitis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>], insect bites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preseptal-cellulitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], animal bites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preseptal-cellulitis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], or foreign bodies. In one retrospective series of 104 patients with preseptal cellulitis admitted to a tertiary care center, roughly 30 percent were thought to originate from each of the following causes: acute dacryocystitis, sinusitis or upper respiratory tract infection, or trauma (including recent eyelid or strabismus surgery) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preseptal-cellulitis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In another retrospective study that included 262 children with preseptal or orbital cellulitis, trauma (including insect bites) was much more common in patients with preseptal cellulitis than in those with orbital cellulitis (40 versus 11 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preseptal-cellulitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Bacteremic seeding of the preseptal space is rare. It is occasionally seen in infants with bacteremia due to <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em>, or <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83430763\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data concerning the causes of preseptal cellulitis are limited. Blood cultures are almost always negative, and it is usually difficult to obtain cultures from the infected site. Based on the available data, the most common causes of preseptal cellulitis are <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, other streptococci, and anaerobes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F77104\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77104 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preseptal-cellulitis/abstract/3,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9</a>], with the most likely pathogen(s) depending on the site of origin of the infection. As examples, infections arising from skin trauma around the eye are likely to be caused by <em>S. aureus</em>, whereas infection arising from the sinuses or nasopharynx are more likely to be caused by <em>S. pneumoniae</em> or beta-hemolytic streptococci. However, there is little consistency among studies regarding the pathogens recovered.</p><p>Of <em>S. aureus</em> strains, community-acquired methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> (CA-MRSA) is thought to be an increasingly common cause of infection. Although most cases of preseptal cellulitis caused by CA-MRSA have been published only as case reports or retrospective series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preseptal-cellulitis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>], the proportion of other skin and soft tissue infections caused by CA-MRSA has increased dramatically. In a report of 422 adults presenting to emergency departments in 11 United States cities in 2004 with skin and soft tissue infections, 59 percent were caused by MRSA and 97 percent of cases of MRSA were caused by CA-MRSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preseptal-cellulitis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Accordingly, one would expect an appreciable proportion of <em>S. aureus</em> preseptal cellulitis cases to be caused by methicillin-resistant strains; however, data to support this presumption are lacking, in part because of the infrequency of obtaining cultures from these infections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-mrsa-in-adults-epidemiology#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in adults: Epidemiology&quot;, section on 'Community-associated MRSA infection'</a>.) </p><p>Although <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> was previously a common cause of preseptal cellulitis, routine immunization of children with the <em>H. influenzae</em> type b vaccine has caused a sharp decline in the incidence of this species as a cause of preseptal cellulitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preseptal-cellulitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-haemophilus-influenzae\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment of Haemophilus influenzae&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Infrequent causes of preseptal cellulitis include <em>Acinetobacter</em> species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preseptal-cellulitis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>], <em>Nocardia brasiliensis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preseptal-cellulitis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], <em>Bacillus anthracis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preseptal-cellulitis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preseptal-cellulitis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preseptal-cellulitis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], <em>Proteus</em> spp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preseptal-cellulitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], <em>Pasteurella multocida </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preseptal-cellulitis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preseptal-cellulitis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], and <em>Trichophyton</em> spp (the cause of &quot;ringworm&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preseptal-cellulitis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. These pathogens can usually be linked to specific exposures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83430770\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with preseptal cellulitis typically present with unilateral ocular pain, eyelid swelling, and erythema (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F57604\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57604 \">picture 1</a>). </p><p>Chemosis (conjunctival swelling) may occasionally occur in severe cases of preseptal cellulitis. Leukocytosis may also occur in patients with preseptal cellulitis, but is not a sensitive indicator of this infection. The clinical manifestations of preseptal cellulitis should be distinguished from those of orbital cellulitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F55123\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55123 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F62818\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62818 \">table 3</a>), which are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=orbital-cellulitis#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Orbital cellulitis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Serious complications are very rare in preseptal cellulitis. It is also rare for untreated preseptal cellulitis to give rise to orbital cellulitis and very rare for either infection to invade the globe (to produce endophthalmitis). However, some cases that are initially diagnosed as preseptal cellulitis may, in fact, be orbital cellulitis. Therefore, clinicians must be vigilant for features suggesting possible misdiagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H83430777\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=orbital-cellulitis#H19539607\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Orbital cellulitis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H408229749\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main clinical condition to distinguish from preseptal cellulitis is the more serious orbital cellulitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F55123\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55123 \">table 2</a>). This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H83430777\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>A local allergic reaction (eg, to a topical ophthalmic antibiotic) can also have a similar appearance to preseptal cellulitis but can usually be differentiated by the exposure history. Periorbital swelling from environmental allergies or angioedema is usually bilateral (in contrast to preseptal cellulitis, which is usually unilateral).</p><p>Other superficial periorbital processes are typically visually distinct from preseptal cellulitis. Hordeolums (styes) and chalazions are associated with eyelid inflammation, but are usually discrete nodular lesions (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eyelid-lesions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eyelid lesions&quot;</a>). Conjunctivitis can rarely cause eyelid edema, but conjunctival findings (eg, injection and irritation) clearly distinguish this from preseptal cellulitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=conjunctivitis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Conjunctivitis&quot;, section on 'Etiology and clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83430777\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preseptal cellulitis is usually a clinical diagnosis, made in a patient with eyelid swelling and erythema once orbital cellulitis has been excluded. Imaging can be a useful diagnostic tool for uncertain cases. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3623562543\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical evaluation and diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preseptal cellulitis is suspected in patients with unilateral eyelid swelling and erythema (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F57604\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57604 \">picture 1</a>). A history of recent sinusitis, insect bite, or local face <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> eyelid trauma is supportive of the diagnosis. The most important aspect of the diagnostic evaluation is distinguishing preseptal cellulitis from the more severe orbital cellulitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F55123\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55123 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F62818\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62818 \">table 3</a>), as these different infections have very different clinical implications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preseptal-cellulitis/abstract/3,22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,22-25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=orbital-cellulitis#H19539607\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Orbital cellulitis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Findings that should raise concern for orbital rather than preseptal cellulitis include ophthalmoplegia with diplopia, pain with eye movement, visual impairment, and proptosis. This is because orbital cellulitis causes swelling and inflammation of the extraocular muscles and fatty tissues within the orbit, but preseptal cellulitis does not. Although chemosis can rarely occur in severe cases of preseptal cellulitis, it is more commonly suggestive of orbital cellulitis. The absence of fever suggests preseptal cellulitis, although patients with orbital cellulitis are sometimes afebrile. As an example, in a retrospective study that included 262 children, fever occurred more commonly in those with orbital cellulitis than in those with preseptal cellulitis (94 versus 47 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preseptal-cellulitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>These clinical features usually allow for a reasonable degree of confidence in distinguishing between the two entities. However, the clinical evaluation can be challenging in young children, who may not be able to cooperate with a full examination. In uncertain cases, computed tomography (CT) scanning of the orbits and sinuses is used to distinguish preseptal cellulitis from orbital cellulitis. (See <a href=\"#H83430784\" class=\"local\">'Imaging studies'</a> below.) </p><p>If the distinction between the two remains uncertain following evaluation, patients should be managed as though they have orbital cellulitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=orbital-cellulitis#H19539607\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Orbital cellulitis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=orbital-cellulitis#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Orbital cellulitis&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3761391380\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory testing is generally unnecessary for patients with preseptal cellulitis. We suggest that blood cultures <strong>not</strong> be routinely performed, as the yield in this setting is extremely low. However, blood cultures are reasonable in patients with fever or suspected orbital cellulitis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83430784\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contrast-enhanced CT scanning of the orbits and sinuses is helpful for distinguishing between preseptal and orbital cellulitis and is indicated if any clinical signs or symptoms point to orbital cellulitis rather than preseptal cellulitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F55123\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55123 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F62818\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62818 \">table 3</a>). CT imaging is also indicated in patients with presumed preseptal cellulitis who exhibit marked eyelid swelling, fever, and leukocytosis, or whose infection fails to show improvement after 24 to 48 hours of appropriate antibiotics.</p><p>Imaging findings of preseptal cellulitis demonstrate swelling of the eyelid(s) but no proptosis, no fat stranding of the orbital contents, and no edema of the extraocular muscles. Sinusitis may be present in preseptal cellulitis but is almost always present in orbital cellulitis. It is important to note that in some cases of orbital cellulitis, the CT scan abnormalities may be subtle. Imaging studies in patients with suspected orbital cellulitis are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=orbital-cellulitis#H459379685\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Orbital cellulitis&quot;, section on 'Imaging studies'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83430791\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no randomized trials of antibiotic regimens for the treatment of preseptal cellulitis. Blood cultures are rarely positive and cultures from the site of infection are difficult to obtain. Therefore, treatment is almost always empiric and based upon knowledge of the common infecting organisms (<em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, other streptococci and anaerobes) and their usual susceptibility patterns.</p><p>Adults and children older than one year of age with mild preseptal cellulitis and no signs of systemic toxicity can generally be treated as outpatients with oral antibiotics provided that close follow-up can be ensured. Children younger than one year of age, children who cannot cooperate fully for an examination, and patients who are severely ill should generally be admitted to the hospital and managed according to the recommendations for orbital cellulitis. This is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=orbital-cellulitis#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Orbital cellulitis&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p>It is important to note that patients with subtle clinical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiographic findings suggesting that the orbit is involved should be treated as though they have orbital cellulitis given the serious complications of this entity. Young children who are not able to cooperate for a thorough examination should also be treated as though they have orbital cellulitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=orbital-cellulitis#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Orbital cellulitis&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83430798\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotic regimens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of antibiotics for empiric treatment has been made much more difficult by the emergence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> (CA-MRSA), which now constitute a substantial proportion of community-acquired strains of <em>S. aureus</em>. Previously, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefpodoxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefpodoxime</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefdinir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefdinir</a> were excellent choices. However, these agents do not have activity against CA-MRSA.

Outpatients who worsen over 24 hours or fail to show signs of improvement in 24 to 48 hours should generally be hospitalized, treated with broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics, and undergo a computed tomography (CT) scan to evaluate for orbital cellulitis and its complications.

A case series of six patients with recurrent preseptal cellulitis, defined as three or more episodes within a one year period with complete resolution between episodes, identified the underlying cause in two patients as environmental allergies, and in one patient each as recurrent sinusitis, herpes simplex infection, contact dermatitis to cosmetics, and Munchausen&rsquo;s syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preseptal-cellulitis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. An anatomic abnormality of the sinuses may also predispose to recurrent preseptal cellulitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preseptal-cellulitis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83431329\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preseptal cellulitis and orbital cellulitis involve different anatomic sites, with preseptal cellulitis referring to infections of the soft tissues anterior to the orbital septum and orbital cellulitis referring to infections posterior to it (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F68971\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68971 \">figure 1</a>). Orbital cellulitis involves the muscles and fat located within the orbit. Although preseptal and orbital cellulitis may be confused with one another because both can cause ocular pain and eyelid swelling and erythema, they have very different clinical implications. Preseptal cellulitis is generally a mild condition that rarely leads to serious complications, whereas orbital cellulitis may cause loss of vision and, very rarely, even loss of life. Orbital cellulitis can usually be distinguished from preseptal cellulitis by its clinical features (ophthalmoplegia, pain with eye movements, and proptosis) and by imaging studies; in cases in which the distinction is not clear, clinicians should treat patients as though they have orbital cellulitis. Both conditions are more common in children than in adults. (See <a href=\"#H83430247\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H83430254\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preseptal cellulitis arises most commonly from sinusitis or a contiguous infection of the soft tissues of the face and eyelids secondary to local trauma, insect or animal bites, or foreign bodies. (See <a href=\"#H83430756\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common causes of preseptal cellulitis are <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (including community-acquired methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> [CA-MRSA]), <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> and other streptococci, and anaerobes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F77104\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77104 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H83430763\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with preseptal cellulitis typically present with unilateral ocular pain, eyelid swelling, and erythema (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F57604\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57604 \">picture 1</a>). During the initial evaluation, it is critical to distinguish preseptal cellulitis from the more serious orbital cellulitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F55123\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55123 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F62818\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62818 \">table 3</a>). Although both preseptal cellulitis and orbital cellulitis typically cause eyelid swelling and erythema, the presence of ophthalmoplegia, pain with eye movements, chemosis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> proptosis occur with orbital cellulitis, but not with preseptal cellulitis. (See <a href=\"#H83430770\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3623562543\" class=\"local\">'Clinical evaluation and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis can usually be made on the basis of these clinical features. However, in uncertain cases, computed tomography (CT) scanning of the orbits and sinuses can usually distinguish preseptal cellulitis from orbital cellulitis. (See <a href=\"#H83430784\" class=\"local\">'Imaging studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adults and children older than one year of age with mild preseptal cellulitis can be managed on an outpatient basis, provided that the patient has no signs of systemic toxicity and close follow-up is ensured. In these cases, we recommend treatment with oral antibiotics with activity against <em>S. aureus</em> (including MRSA) and streptococci, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> monotherapy or combination therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> <strong>plus</strong> one of the following agents: <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a>, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefpodoxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefpodoxime</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefdinir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefdinir</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). If the patient has not been immunized against <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, one of the combination regimens that includes a beta-lactam should be used. (See <a href=\"#H83430798\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic regimens'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We generally recommend a treatment duration of five to seven days, but if signs of cellulitis persist at the end of this period, treatment should be continued until the erythema and swelling have resolved or nearly resolved. (See <a href=\"#H83430812\" class=\"local\">'Duration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients younger than one year of age and those who are severely ill should be admitted to the hospital and managed according to the recommendations for orbital cellulitis. Patients with subtle clinical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiographic findings suggesting that the orbit is involved, as well as young children who are not able to cooperate for a thorough examination, should also be treated as though they have orbital cellulitis given the serious complications of this entity.
