The prostate is a gland that surrounds the urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder out through the penis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F65675\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65675 \">figure 1</a>). This gland often gets bigger in men as they get older.</p><p>Benign prostatic hyperplasia, also called &quot;BPH,&quot; is a common problem. It has nothing to do with prostate cancer. In fact, the word &quot;benign&quot; means &quot;not cancer.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H295530330\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of BPH?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many men with BPH have no symptoms at all. When symptoms do occur, they can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Needing to urinate often, especially at night</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having trouble starting to urinate (this means that you might have to wait or strain before urine will come out)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having a weak urine stream</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leaking or dribbling urine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling as though your bladder is not empty even after you urinate</p><p/><p>In rare cases, BPH makes it so a man cannot urinate at all. This is a serious problem. If you cannot urinate at all, call your doctor right away.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H295530337\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for BPH?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse can check for BPH by doing a rectal exam. That means that he or she will put a finger into your anus to check how big your prostate is and what it feels like (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F80412\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80412 \">figure 2</a>). Your doctor or nurse might also do urine or blood tests to see if your symptoms might be caused by another problem, such as a bladder infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H295530344\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You might be able to improve your BPH symptoms by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reducing the amount of fluid you drink, especially just before bed</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limiting the amount of alcohol and caffeine you drink. These drinks can make you urinate more often.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoiding cold and allergy medicines that contain antihistamines or decongestants. These medicines can make the symptoms of BPH worse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Doing something doctors call &quot;double voiding.&quot; That means that after you empty your bladder, you wait a moment, relax, and try to urinate again.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H295530351\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have symptoms like the ones listed above, see your doctor or nurse to find out if BPH is really what's causing them. Those symptoms can be caused by other problems, so it's important to have them checked out.</p><p>If you do have BPH, your doctor or nurse can offer you different treatment options. But you don't have to get treated if your symptoms do not bother you. Unless you lose the ability to urinate completely, leaving BPH untreated will not hurt you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H295530358\"><span class=\"h1\">How is BPH treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments options include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Watchful waiting</strong> &ndash; Watchful waiting means that you wait to see if your symptoms change, but you don't have treatment right away. Men who choose this option can decide to try treatment later if their symptoms get worse or if their symptoms start to bother them more.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medicines</strong> &ndash; There are two types of medicine commonly used to treat BPH. One type relaxes the muscles that surround the urethra. The other type keeps the prostate from growing more or even helps the prostate shrink. In some cases, doctors suggest taking both types of medicine at the same time. Depending on your symptoms, your doctor might also suggest other medicines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Surgery</strong> &ndash; Surgery to treat BPH works by removing some of the prostate or by causing the prostate to shrink. There are several surgeries to choose from.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H295530365\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I choose which treatment to have?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The right treatment for you will depend on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How much your symptoms bother you</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How you feel about the different treatment options</p><p/><p>If your symptoms don't bother you very much, you might not need any treatment. On the other hand, if your symptoms do bother you, you probably should get treated.</p><p>Doctors often suggest trying medicines first to see if they help. If medicines don't do enough, surgery is also an option. As you think about your choices, remember that treatments can have a downside. Medicines can cause side effects, for example. And surgery has some general risks, and can also sometimes cause sexual problems and other side effects.</p><p>When you're thinking about which treatment to have, ask your doctor or nurse these questions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How likely is it that this treatment will improve my symptoms?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the risks or side effects of this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happens if I don't have this treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H295530470\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-incontinence-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Urinary incontinence (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=benign-prostatic-hyperplasia-bph-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
