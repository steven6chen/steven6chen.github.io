The body requires a small amount of sodium in the diet to control blood pressure and blood volume. However, most people consume many times the amount of sodium needed. A healthy level of sodium in the diet contains fewer than 2.3 grams (2300 milligrams, or about the amount of sodium in one teaspoon) of sodium each day. People with certain medical conditions such as high blood pressure, kidney disease, and heart problems can benefit from a diet that is lower in sodium.</p><p>This topic will review how to read food labels, how to choose foods that are lower in sodium, and how to live with less salt.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">WHY SHOULD I REDUCE SODIUM IN MY DIET?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reducing sodium intake lowers blood pressure in people with high and borderline high blood pressure. Reducing sodium can also help to prevent the collection of fluid in the lower legs or abdomen. People with chronic kidney disease and heart failure must control sodium intake to prevent volume overload, which increases blood pressure and causes swelling. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Chronic kidney disease (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Heart failure (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Switching from a higher-sodium diet to a lower-sodium diet can modestly reduce blood pressure in people who have normal blood pressure. When the sodium intake is lowered from 4000 mg to 2000 mg per day, blood pressure falls by 2 to 3 mmHg. This reduction may be as great as 10 mmHg over several years and can substantially lower the risk of heart disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Benefits</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to directly reducing blood pressure, a lower sodium intake may also enhance the effectiveness of high blood pressure medications and other non-drug treatments, such as weight loss. A lower sodium intake has also been associated with other health benefits, including a reduced risk of dying from a stroke, reversal of heart enlargement, and a reduced risk of kidney stones and osteoporosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kidney-stones-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Kidney stones in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporosis-prevention-and-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Osteoporosis prevention and treatment (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE IS SODIUM FOUND?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main source of sodium in the diet is the salt added to packaged and processed foods and in foods from restaurants. Processed foods include prepared frozen meals, canned foods, soups, pickled foods, snack foods, lunch meats, cheese, condiments, sauces, dressings, breads, cereals, and soda (including diet soda) just to name a few. Sodium found in processed food accounts for approximately 80 percent of a person's daily sodium intake in a typical Western diet, and can quickly add up, even without the use of the salt shaker.</p><p>Terms like &quot;low sodium&quot; and &quot;reduced sodium&quot; can be confusing. The following table provides a guide to what these terms mean (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F61514\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61514 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Guidelines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several professional organizations have issued evidence-based guidelines for reducing sodium intake. Most clinicians agree that people with high blood pressure should consume less than 2300 milligrams (2.3 grams) of sodium per day. People with other conditions may be advised to consume even less (1500 to 1800 mg per day).</p><p>The sodium content of packaged, processed, and prepared foods can usually be determined by reading food labels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F56605\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56605 \">figure 1</a>) or consulting a reference book. Many web sites provide nutrient data (eg, <a href=\"http://www.nutrition.gov/&amp;token=XdHKy4ocMGWw3t/qnemaPXSWpgw/0sNrwpY8g1DsnwIng4095mMxYKel1K7syBN0&amp;TOPIC_ID=4411\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.nutrition.gov</a>), and low-sodium cookbooks are also available.</p><p>It is important to remember that the amount of sodium listed is for a particular serving size; eating more or less than the listed serving size changes the amount of sodium consumed. In addition, many people add more salt to foods; just one teaspoon of table salt contains approximately 2300 milligrams of sodium, which is more than many people need for the entire day. Most fresh foods, and now some frozen foods, have a low sodium content and can be substituted for foods that are high in sodium. Reading labels, when provided, can be extremely helpful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">HOW DO I CUT DOWN ON SODIUM?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although it is difficult to cut back on the amount of sodium in the diet, most people find that their taste adjusts quickly to reduced sodium. Salt is an acquired taste, and taste buds can be retrained in less than one to two weeks if people stick with the lower-sodium diet. Fresh herbs, spice blends without sodium, citrus, and flavored vinegar make tasty alternatives to the salt shaker.</p><p>It may be helpful to keep a detailed food record and add up sodium intake. Within a short period of time (less than a week), the main sources of sodium can be identified, and daily intake can be calculated.</p><p>Suggestions to decrease sodium include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put away the salt shaker and reduce or eliminate salt in cooking. Experiment with herbs, spices, garlic, onions, or lemon instead.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Look for low-sodium products such as spice blends, and read labels for serving size and sodium content on canned, bottled, and frozen foods.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make a list of healthy low-sodium foods to substitute. Many grocery stores now supply this information.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When dining out, request the food be prepared without salt, have dressings or sauces on the side, and avoid bacon bits, cheese, and croutons at the salad bar.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not add salt to food while cooking or before eating. Teach family members to taste food before adding salt.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid eating at fast food restaurants. If this is not possible, choose restaurants that offer fruits or vegetables without sauces or dressings. Ask that no salt be used to prepare food, when possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not use salt substitutes that are high in potassium unless a healthcare provider approves. Herb and spice combinations that are salt free are widely available and can be used to flavor foods.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Water softeners remove calcium and add sodium to drinking water. Do not drink softened water. When purchasing bottled water, check the label to ensure that it does not contain sodium.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Look at labels for over-the-counter medications. Avoid products that contain sodium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate. Sodium bicarbonate is baking soda.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fresh fruits and vegetables are naturally low in sodium. In addition, a diet rich in fruits and vegetables provides additional benefits in lowering blood pressure. The DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) is a well-known intervention to treat high blood pressure. The DASH diet requires the person to eat four to five servings of fruit, four to five servings of vegetables, and two to three servings of low-fat dairy, and all foods must contain less than 25 percent total fat per serving.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Foods to choose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following are examples of foods that are generally low in sodium. <strong>Check the label</strong> to determine the amount of sodium, as amounts can vary widely from one brand to another.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biscuits &ndash; Whole grain breads, English muffins, bagels, corn and flour tortillas, most muffins</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cereals &ndash; Many cooked low-salt (read the label to determine sodium content) hot cereals (not instant) such as oatmeal, cream of wheat, rice, or farina, puffed wheat, puffed rice, shredded wheat</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Crackers and snack foods &ndash; All unsalted crackers and snack foods, unsalted peanut butter, unsalted nuts or seeds, unsalted popcorn</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pasta, rice, and potatoes &ndash; Any type of pasta (cooked in unsalted water), potatoes, white or brown rice</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dried peas and beans &ndash; Any cooked dried beans or peas (without seasoning packet), or low-salt canned beans and peas</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Meats and protein &ndash; Fresh or frozen beef, poultry, and fish; low-sodium canned tuna and salmon; eggs or egg substitutes</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fruits and vegetables &ndash; Any fresh, frozen, or canned fruit, any fresh or frozen vegetables without sauce, canned vegetables without salt, low-salt tomato <span class=\"nowrap\">sauce/paste</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dairy products &ndash; Milk, cream, sour cream, non-dairy creamer, yogurt, lower-sodium cottage and other cheeses (be sure to read labels for serving size)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fats and oils &ndash; Plant oils (olive, canola, corn, peanut), unsalted butter or margarine</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Soups &ndash; Salt-free soups and low-sodium bouillon cubes, unsalted broth, homemade soup without added salt</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sweets &ndash; Gelatin, sherbet, pudding, ice cream (brands vary widely), salt-free baked goods, sugar, honey, jam, jelly, marmalade, syrup</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beverages &ndash; Coffee, tea, soft drinks, fruit-flavored drinks, low-salt tomato juice, any fruit juice</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Condiments &ndash; Fresh and dried herbs; lemon juice; low-salt mustard (not commercially available but can be made at home), vinegar, and Tabasco sauce; low- or no-salt ketchup; seasoning blends that do not contain salt</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Foods to avoid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many foods, especially those that are processed, have a high sodium content.
