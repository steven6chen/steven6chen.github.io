It encompasses a histological spectrum that ranges from fat accumulation in hepatocytes without concomitant inflammation or fibrosis (simple hepatic steatosis) to hepatic steatosis with a necroinflammatory component (steatohepatitis) that may or may not have associated fibrosis. The latter condition, referred to as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), may progress to cirrhosis in up to 20 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. NASH is now recognized to be a leading cause of cryptogenic cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease has not been fully elucidated. The most widely supported theory implicates insulin resistance as the key mechanism leading to hepatic steatosis, and perhaps also to steatohepatitis. Others have proposed that a &quot;second hit,&quot; or additional oxidative injury, is required to manifest the necroinflammatory component of steatohepatitis. Hepatic iron, leptin, antioxidant deficiencies, and intestinal bacteria have all been suggested as potential oxidative stressors.</p><p>This topic review will focus on the pathogenesis of NAFLD. An approach to such patients is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natural-history-and-management-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Natural history and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES OF TRIGLYCERIDE ACCUMULATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatic steatosis is a manifestation of excessive triglyceride accumulation in the liver. This can occur from the excessive importation of free fatty acids (FFA) from adipose tissue, from diminished hepatic export of FFA (secondary to reduced synthesis or secretion of very low-density lipoprotein [VLDL]), or from impaired beta-oxidation of FFA. The major sources of triglycerides are from fatty acids stored in adipose tissue and fatty acids newly made within the liver through de novo lipogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive importation of FFA can result from either increased delivery of triglycerides to the liver (as seen with obesity and rapid weight loss), or from excessive conversion of carbohydrates and proteins to triglycerides (eg, secondary to overfeeding or use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impaired VLDL synthesis and secretion can result from abetalipoproteinemia, protein malnutrition, or choline deficiency. Patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) may have a defect in postprandial Apo B secretion, leading to triglyceride accumulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition, a defect in the lipidation of Apo B, caused by an inhibition of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), may be a key mechanism in drug-induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), such as seen with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Depletion of the orphan receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP) results in increased VLDL secretion, elevated MTP levels, and increased insulin sensitivity, whereas induction of SHP results in the rapid accumulation of hepatocyte lipids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Impaired VLDL synthesis and secretion were also more apparent in patients with NASH compared with patients with hepatic steatosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This may have resulted in the induction of lipid oxidation and oxidative hepatocyte damage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of hypertriglyceridemia with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) reduces steatosis, oxidative stress, inflammation, and progression of fibrosis in a NASH animal model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the 96-week <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pioglitazone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pioglitazone</a> versus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-e-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Vitamin E</a> versus Placebo for the Treatment of Nondiabetic Patients with Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (PIVENS) trial, patients who had resolution of NASH seen on biopsy also had significant decreases in triglyceride levels (-21.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> versus -2.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impaired beta-oxidation of FFA to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) may be seen with vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) deficiency, excessive alcohol consumption, or coenzyme A deficiency (as can occur with valproic acid or chronic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> use). Activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha appears to have a central role in stimulating beta-oxidation and disposing hepatic fatty acids in NASH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The ability to recover from hepatic ATP depletion is severely impaired in patients with obesity-related NASH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Compromised hepatic ATP homeostasis may predispose to injury from other insults. Adiponectin, a fat derived hormone, appears to have a pivotal role in improving fatty acid oxidation and decreasing fatty acid synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Administration of adiponectin improved hepatomegaly, steatosis, and alanine aminotransferase levels in obese, leptin deficient mice. Also implicated in the steatosis pathway is the cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1). Administration of a CB1 receptor antagonist rapidly abolished hepatic steatosis, improved aminotransferase levels, reduced the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, and increased adiponectin levels in leptin-deficient mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Triglyceride synthesis and oxidation appear to be regulated, at least in part, by the enzyme acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1). DGAT1 deficient hepatocytes were protected from hepatic steatosis by reducing synthesis and increasing oxidation of fatty acids in an animal knockout model. DGAT1 activity was necessary for the manifestation of hepatic steatosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Micro RNA (MiRNA) also has a role in hepatocellular lipid metabolism and immunity. These are small non-coding RNAs that post-translationally modulate gene function and are involved in cellular processes, including cellular proliferation, inflammation, and apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Alterations in MiRNA activity result in hepatocellular injury, apoptosis, and portal fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In NAFLD, specific MiRNA appear to regulate genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis. Antagonism of specific MiRNA leads to decreased fatty acid synthesis and increased hepatic fatty acid oxidation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INSULIN RESISTANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Insulin resistance has a key role in the development of hepatic steatosis and, potentially, steatohepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/18-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-24</a>]. Obesity and type 2 diabetes, conditions associated with peripheral insulin resistance, are frequently observed in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Insulin resistance has also been observed in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) who are not obese and those who have normal glucose tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/20,25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,25-27</a>]. Despite the strong association, not all patients with NASH exhibit insulin resistance. This suggests that NASH may be a heterogeneous syndrome with more than one cause. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Structure and function of the insulin receptor&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The genetic basis for insulin resistance associated with NASH remains unclear. One report found an association with certain polymorphisms in the gene encoding for apoliprotein C3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], while another study demonstrated that IL-6 polymorphisms are associated with NAFLD and markers of insulin resistance and inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. A third report found polymorphisms in a gene encoding for protein expressed in adipose tissue (adiponutrin) and involved in triglyceride metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Certain variants of the gene were strongly associated with the histologic severity of NAFLD. In addition, alterations in the transcriptional activity of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &gamma; coactivator 1&alpha; (PPARGC1A) promoter correlated with the insulin resistance phenotype and the presence of NAFLD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In both adults and children, a single nucleotide polymorphism in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1-alpha gene (<em>PPARGC1A</em>) has been associated with an increased risk for developing NAFLD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. A clinical trial supports the receptor's pathophysiological role. Patients who took elafibranor (an agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors alpha and delta) 120 mg daily for 52 weeks had resolution of NASH with improvements in fibrosis, liver enzymes, glucose and lipid profiles, and systemic inflammatory markers more often than those who received placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Increases in visceral adipose tissue and intrahepatic fat correlate with increased gluconeogenesis, increased free fatty acid (FFA) levels, and insulin resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Visceral fat has also been associated with liver inflammation and fibrosis in patients with NASH independently of insulin resistance, an effect possibly mediated by interleukin-6 (a proinflammatory cytokine) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Increased expression of hepatic interleukin-6 correlated with insulin resistance in another report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Several other cytokines and adipokines involved in insulin receptor signaling appear to be altered in omental adipose tissue of NASH patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The activation of tumor necrosis factor alpha-converting enzyme correlated with levels of insulin resistance, macrovesicular steatosis, and balloon degeneration in an animal model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Further supporting the role of insulin resistance are the observations from pilot studies, which have demonstrated beneficial effects of glucose-sensitizing medications in patients with NAFLD. Treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosiglitazone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rosiglitazone</a> reduced the expression of hepatic acute phase reactants (C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A), suggesting that improvements in insulin sensitivity correspond with a reduction in inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Similarly, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pioglitazone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pioglitazone</a> therapy led to significant improvements in steatosis and necroinflammation in patients with NASH and impaired glucose tolerance, correlating with decreases in adipose tissue insulin resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In other reports, patients with NAFLD and glucose intolerance were significantly more insulin resistant than glucose intolerant patients without fatty liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natural-history-and-management-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults#H254497165\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Natural history and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Thiazolidinediones'</a>.)</p><p>Resistance to the action of insulin results in important changes in lipid metabolism. These include enhanced peripheral lipolysis, increased triglyceride synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>], and increased hepatic uptake of fatty acids. Each of these may contribute to the accumulation of hepatocellular triglyceride [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], which in turn results in a preferential shift from carbohydrate to FFA beta-oxidation, an occurrence that has been demonstrated in patients with insulin resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/19,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,45</a>]. Significantly increased FFA levels have been observed in patients with NAFLD and type 2 diabetes mellitus, compared with type 2 diabetics without NAFLD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Role of diet, obesity, and inflammation'</a>.)</p><p>The molecular pathways leading to insulin resistance are complex and have not been completely elucidated. Several molecules appear to be involved in interfering with the actions of insulin on a cellular level. </p><p>Lipophilic bile acids have been demonstrated to promote insulin sensitivity and decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis and triglyceridemia via binding to the farnesoid X nuclear receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. A randomized trial with 141 patients demonstrated that 45 percent of the patients who received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obeticholic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">obeticholic acid</a> (a potent farnesoid X nuclear receptor activator) had a two point or greater improvement in NAFLD activity score on liver biopsy after 72 weeks of treatment compared with 21 percent of patients in the placebo group, supporting the receptor's role in NAFLD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H366045064\"><span class=\"h1\">HEPATOCELLULAR INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FFAs are inducers of several cytochrome p-450 microsomal lipoxygenases, capable of producing hepatotoxic free oxygen radical species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Furthermore, the shift to FFA beta-oxidation in the setting of preexisting defects in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation may result in increased free radical formation, hepatocellular injury, and fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Electron microscopy of hepatocytes from patients with NAFLD demonstrated that significant mitochondrial structural abnormalities were present in patients with NASH, but not those with simple hepatic steatosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. These investigators hypothesized that, in the absence of these mitochondrial defects, peripheral insulin resistance will lead only to the development of simple fatty liver. Consistent with this theory is the observation that several genes important for mitochondrial function were significantly underexpressed in NASH patients, suggesting that there is a transcriptional or pretranscriptional basis for impaired mitochondrial function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. On the other hand, it is possible that mitochondrial structural abnormalities may simply be a consequence of increased lipid peroxidation since lipid peroxidation products alter both mitochondrial DNA and mitochondrial respiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>].</p><p>Others have suggested that the development of hepatocellular injury requires the presence of both insulin resistance and a second defect that results in the accumulation of damaging free oxygen radical species. Several potential oxidative stressors have been proposed to result in necroinflammation.</p><p>The activation of nuclear factor kappa-beta and increased cytokine production appear to mediate the hepatocyte inflammatory process. Numerous proinflammatory cytokines and inflammatory mediators have been identified as having a role in hepatocyte inflammation and injury, including the activation of TNF-alpha, the complement system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>], plasma myeloperoxidase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>], natural killer cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>], among others. Estrogens may protect against fibrogenesis in NAFLD patients as men and postmenopausal women have been found to have a high risk for more severe fibrosis compared with premenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Furthermore, the induction of the Hedgehog ligand pathway appears to correlate with the severity of portal inflammation in both adult and pediatric patients with NAFLD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. Evidence also points to a pathogenic role of caspase-2, a protease involved in cellular apoptosis, whose expression strongly correlates with liver disease severity in patients with NAFLD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. In animal models, caspace-2 deficiency protected the liver from steatohepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTIOXIDANTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lipid peroxidation and free oxygen radical species can deplete antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-e-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin E</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-carotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">beta-carotene</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-c-ascorbic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin C</a>, thus rendering the liver susceptible to oxidative injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. Serum levels of xanthine oxidase, a generator of reactive oxygen species, are higher in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) compared with controls, whereas levels of multiple antioxidant enzymes are lower [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. In addition, the induction of heme oxygenase-1, an antioxidant defense enzyme, interrupted the progression of steatohepatitis by inducing an antioxidant pathway and suppressing proinflammatory cytokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. A correlation between disease severity and increased expression of oxidative scavenger receptors has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Serotonin has been implicated as a source of reactive oxygen species in NASH. Increased catabolism of serotonin resulted in increased levels of reactive oxidative species and necroinflammation in an animal NASH model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p>There is indirect evidence supporting the role of antioxidants in preventing oxidative liver injury. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-e-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Vitamin E</a> therapy normalized serum aminotransferase elevations in children with fatty liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].

Among the 35 percent of patients with NAFLD who had stainable hepatic iron, those with a reticuloendothelial system (RES) cell pattern of iron staining were more likely to have portal inflammation, hepatocellular ballooning, definite steatohepatitis, and fibrosis. Patients with RES iron were also significantly more likely to have advanced fibrosis.</p><p/><p>The specific mechanism by which hepatic iron may contribute to necroinflammation is unknown, but may be related to the generation of free oxygen radical species that occurs in the process of reduction of Fe 3+ to Fe 2+ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].

In addition, compared with glucose intolerant patients without fatty liver disease, glucose intolerant patients with fatty liver disease were 2.5 times more hyperinsulinemic at baseline. In those with fatty liver disease, both hyperinsulinemia and aminotransferase elevations were exceptionally responsive to iron depletion, even though all of the patients had normal iron indices. Interestingly, the glucose intolerant patients without fatty liver disease did not demonstrate significant improvements in fasting insulin levels after phlebotomy.</p><p>Still unexplained is the observation that homozygosity for the hemochromatosis gene mutation does not appear to confer an increased risk for the development of NAFLD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Furthermore, the clinical significance of iron overload in NASH with respect to clinically relevant endpoints is unclear. In an unselected cohort of 65 patients with NASH, iron accumulation was not associated with increased overall mortality, liver-related mortality, or development of cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Additionally, a prospective study did not demonstrate an improvement in hepatic steatosis (based on magnetic resonance imaging), ALT levels, or insulin sensitivity indices among patients who underwent six months of phlebotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">LEPTIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Leptin is a peptide produced primarily in adipose tissue.

Blood leptin levels correlate with the degree of fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>], and leptin-deficient obese mice that are exposed to a methionine-choline-deficient diet, a necroinflammatory insult, do not develop hepatic fibrosis. Administration of leptin into the central nervous system (CNS) of mice with fatty liver corrected insulin resistance and fatty liver, while peripheral administration did not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. This suggests resistance to leptin in the central nervous system, rather than the liver, may be important in the pathogenesis of NASH. On the other hand, no relationship between leptin levels and fibrosis stage (after adjusting for potential confounders) was found in a study of 88 patients with NAFLD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">ADIPONECTIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adiponectin is a hormone secreted exclusively by adipose tissue that produces beneficial effects on lipid metabolism, enhancing both lipid clearance from plasma and beta-oxidation of fatty acids in muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Adiponectin appears to have a role in modulating insulin sensitivity. In one report, plasma adiponectin levels were significantly associated with hepatic insulin sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. Furthermore, administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pioglitazone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pioglitazone</a> increased adiponectin levels, which correlated with improvements in hepatic steatosis, necroinflammation, and fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/86,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">86,87</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">RESISTIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Resistin is an adipose-derived protein that may have an important physiological role in the development of insulin resistance.

In addition, administering antisense oligonucleotides against resistin mRNA completely reversed the marked increase in resistin levels and severe insulin resistance that developed in mice fed high-fat diets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">INTESTINAL MICROBES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intestinal microbes have been implicated as a potential source of hepatotoxic oxidative injury.

Another report found increased intestinal permeability in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), possibly related to small intestinal bacterial overgrowth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>].</p><p>Studies suggests that the specific composition of gut microbiota may play a role in both the inflammatory and fibrosis responses in patients with NAFLD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. Among 57 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD, those with <em>Bacteroides</em> genus counts in the second and third tertile had a twofold increase in NASH compared with those with lower <em>Bacteroides</em> counts who were found to also have an abundance of <em>Prevotella</em> bacteria. With respect to fibrosis stage, those with <em>Ruminococcus</em> counts in the third tertile were found to have a twofold increase in stage 2 or greater fibrosis compared with those with lower levels of <em>Ruminococcus</em>.</p><p>One proposed mechanism pertains to the production of endogenous alcohol and acetaldehyde [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. Colonic bacteria and yeast possess an enormous metabolic capacity for generating both ethanol and acetaldehyde, and can oxidize ethanol to high levels of acetaldehyde, even at low ethanol concentrations. Acetaldehyde is easily absorbed into the portal blood stream and can initiate histological changes similar to those seen in NAFLD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. High concentrations of endogenous alcohol production have been found in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>] and animals with intestinal blind-loops [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].

Increased intestinal permeability and increased portal endotoxemia have been demonstrated in genetically obese mice, which are consistent with this theory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/101,102\" class=\"abstract_t\">101,102</a>]. Significant increases in markers of intestinal permeability and a higher prevalence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth have been demonstrated in humans with NAFLD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. These changes correlated with the severity of hepatic steatosis.</p><p>Other possible mechanisms by which intestinal bacteria may contribute to hepatocellular injury include deconjugation of bile salts and inactivation of hepatic lipotropes, such as choline. Further supporting a pathogenic role for intestinal bacteria is the observation that the administration of antibiotics, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polymyxin-b-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">polymyxin B</a>, improved steatosis grades in both rats and humans on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a>, and in alcohol-exposed rats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/103-105\" class=\"abstract_t\">103-105</a>].

Finally, the administration of probiotics to mice with NAFLD led to improvements in steatosis, hepatomegaly, and nuclear factor kappa-beta activity after four weeks of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obstructive sleep apnea has been proposed to have a role in inducing inflammation in NAFLD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>]. Compared with controls, mice on a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet exposed to six months of chronic intermittent hypoxia exhibited histological signs of liver injury, including lobular inflammation and fibrosis. Also noted were significant increases in hepatic lipid peroxidation and levels of proinflammatory cytokines. An observational study in obese patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery found that patients with higher oxygen desaturation index scores (number of drops in oxygen saturation of 3 percent per hour) had more severe histopathologic changes on liver biopsy than patients with lower oxygen desaturation index scores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>].

Hyperlipidemic mice fed high-fat diets with cholesterol developed steatosis with severe inflammation, compared with normolipidemic control animals that developed only steatosis. Hepatic inflammation was linked to increased plasma very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol levels. Omitting cholesterol and lowering VLDL levels prevented hepatic inflammation. On the cellular level, activation of the nuclear receptor constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) is important in the development of lipid peroxidation and steatohepatitis. In a dietary model of NASH, activation of the CAR receptor resulted in hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, in contrast to increased steatosis alone in CAR negative animals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">FIBROSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perisinusoidal (zone 3) fibrosis in patients with NASH is primarily a consequence of the chronic inflammatory process with activation of lobular stellate cells.

Hepatic progenitor cells appear to proliferate in the setting of primary replicative senescence from chronic hepatocyte injury. A ductular reaction ensues, leading to periportal fibrogenesis. Increases in the ductular reaction correlated with the grade of NASH activity, the degree of fibrosis, and the extent of primary hepatocyte replicative arrest, which in turn correlated with insulin resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a spectrum of disorders that range from simple hepatic steatosis without significant inflammation or fibrosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis with varying degrees of inflammation and fibrosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Strong epidemiological, biochemical, and therapeutic evidence supports the premise that the primary pathophysiological derangement in most patients with NAFLD is insulin resistance.
