KS is classified into four types based upon the clinical circumstances in which it develops: classic (the type originally described by Kaposi, which typically presents in middle or old age), endemic (several forms described in sub-Saharan indigenous Africans prior to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS] epidemic), iatrogenic (a type associated with immunosuppressive drug therapy, typically seen in renal allograft recipients), and AIDS-associated (epidemic KS). The epidemiologic and clinical aspects of these four types of KS are compared in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F76370\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76370 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>This review will focus on the clinical presentation, staging, diagnosis, and treatment of classic KS. The epidemiology, risk factors, pathology, and molecular pathogenesis of classic KS are discussed elsewhere, as are AIDS-related KS and iatrogenic KS developing in the setting of immunosuppressive therapy.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classic-kaposi-sarcoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classic Kaposi sarcoma: Epidemiology, risk factors, pathology, and molecular pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CKS is characterized by the appearance of purplish, reddish blue, or dark <span class=\"nowrap\">brown/black</span> macules, plaques, and nodules on the skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F81468%7EDERM%2F69584%7EDERM%2F54707\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81468 graphicRef69584 graphicRef54707 \">picture 1A-C</a>). Nodular lesions may ulcerate and bleed easily. The skin lesions range in size from very small to several centimeters in diameter, and they can remain unchanged for months to years, or grow rapidly within a few weeks and disseminate. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> below.)</p><p>The dermatology literature contains reference to at least 10 different morphologic variants of the cutaneous lesions of KS, which are referred to as patch, plaque, nodular, lymphadenopathic (usually in African children), exophytic, infiltrative (the latter two in African adults with endemic KS), ecchymotic, telangiectatic, keloidal, and cavernous or lymphangioma-like variants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-features-staging-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The cavernous or lymphangioma-like variants are common in CKS, particularly in the setting of chronic lymphedema. In this variant, lesions develop on the lower extremities that consist of compressible nodules that appear to be fluid-filled cysts. Histologically, lymphangioma-like KS consists of anastomosing networks of smaller, irregular, and compressible dilated lymphatics lined by flat and cytologically banal endothelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-features-staging-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p>There may be accompanying lymphedema of the affected extremity. The lymphedema is not generally associated with the presence of bulky regional nodal disease but, instead, is related to local dermal infiltration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dermal lymphatic involvement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-lymphedema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of peripheral lymphedema&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical staging and conservative management of peripheral lymphedema&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Extracutaneous involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During the course of the disease (rarely initially [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-features-staging-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]), mucous membranes of the mouth and gastrointestinal (GI) tract and regional lymph nodes may be affected. GI tract involvement is usually asymptomatic, but bleeding, diarrhea, protein-losing enteropathy, intussusception, and perforation have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-features-staging-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>In general, GI <span class=\"nowrap\">tract/oral</span> mucosal involvement is less common than with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related KS, affecting &le;10 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-features-staging-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-staging-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma: Staging and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, in one report, an extraordinary 82 percent of Greek patients (71 of 87) with biopsy-proven CKS who were investigated with upper GI endoscopy had GI lesions; all 71 had stomach lesions, 19 had esophageal lesions, 8 had lesions of the proximal duodenum, and 2 had both esophageal and duodenal lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-features-staging-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Although this finding could be interpreted as suggesting the need for screening endoscopy in patients with newly diagnosed CKS, it also supports the view that the presence of asymptomatic GI involvement probably has little effect on prognosis. In practice, routine endoscopy is not performed in people diagnosed with CKS who do not have symptoms referable to the GI tract.</p><p>Regional nodal involvement is relatively uncommon, and it is rarely bulky. Nodal involvement was reported in 15 percent of 66 Greek patients with CKS in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-features-staging-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The presence of nodal disease probably does not worsen overall prognosis, although this has been demonstrated in AIDS-related KS, not CKS.</p><p>Involvement of visceral organs other than the lining of the alimentary tract (eg, lung, liver, bone, bone marrow) is extremely rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-features-staging-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/11,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,15-17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Natural history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, CKS has a chronic, indolent course, and it rarely influences survival. Given the affected age group, death from unrelated causes is more common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-features-staging-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. As an example, in a series of 438 American patients with CKS who were followed for an average of 4.8 years, 24 percent died of second malignancies, 22 percent died of other medical conditions, and only 2 percent died of widespread disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-features-staging-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Yet, the disease occasionally has an acute onset and rapidly progressive course, or previously indolent disease can undergo sudden worsening, leading to disability and even death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-features-staging-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/18,19,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19,22</a>]. In fact, Kaposi's original 1872 paper described the disease as &quot;incurable and deadly,&quot; stating that &quot;the disease leads to death, and it does so within a short period of two to three years&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-features-staging-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS AND STAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of Classic Kaposi sarcoma (CKS) is usually suspected based upon the appearance of the characteristic lesions (purplish, reddish blue, or dark <span class=\"nowrap\">brown/black</span> patches, plaques, or nodules) and their distribution (on the skin, most often of the lower extremities).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the lower extremity, the lesions can be mistaken for the skin lesions of peripheral vascular disease, a condition which is common in the older adult patients who are at greatest risk for CKS.</p><p>Other lesions that may mimic the appearance of CKS include bacillary angiomatosis, angiosarcoma, and benign vascular lesions, such as hemangiomas. Bacillary angiomatosis is caused by Bartonella species, a slow-growing, fastidious, gram-negative bacillus, and is readily treated with antibiotic therapy. The skin lesions of bacillary angiomatosis usually appear as numerous, small, red to purple papules that may gradually expand into large pedunculated lesions or nodules that may become friable. The rash may be associated with symptoms such as fever, chills, malaise, headache, and anorexia. <em>Sporothrix schenckii</em> (sporotrichosis) and <em>Mycobacterium marinum</em> skin infections could also be confused with the nodular form of KS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-bartonella-quintana-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of Bartonella quintana infections&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-sporotrichosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of sporotrichosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of nontuberculous mycobacterial infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A variety of less common dermatologic lesions may also be mistaken for CKS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-features-staging-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biopsy is required for definitive diagnosis. In addition to observing typical histological features on standard microscopy, polymerase chain reaction can be performed of the skin lesions to detect amplified herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) DNA sequences, and immunohistochemical staining of biopsy specimens can also be performed to detect the presence of HHV-8 latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA-1) within the spindle cells, thus confirming the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classic-kaposi-sarcoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classic Kaposi sarcoma: Epidemiology, risk factors, pathology, and molecular pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiographic evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Asymptomatic patients with CKS rarely require radiographic evaluation of the affected extremity because of the chronic, usually indolent course. Screening for distant organ involvement is not needed due to the low frequency of radiographically evident metastatic disease. When present, mucosal involvement of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is not generally visible on radiographic studies. As noted above, patients with symptoms referable to the GI tract should be considered for endoscopy to evaluate for visceral mucosal involvement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Staging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related KS, there is no commonly used or universally agreed upon staging system for CKS. The most recent American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system for soft tissue sarcomas of the extremity and trunk specifically excludes KS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-features-staging-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. </p><p>Given the variable natural history of CKS, one group of investigators used their experience with 300 CKS patients to derive a proposed staging system based upon disease distribution and the clinical pace of progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-features-staging-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage I (maculonodular stage) &ndash; Small macules and nodules primarily confined to the lower extremities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage II (infiltrative stage) &ndash; Plaques mainly involving lower extremities, sometimes associated with a few nodules</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage III (florid stage) &ndash; Multiple angiomatous plaques and nodules involving the lower extremities that are often ulcerated</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage IV (disseminated stage) &ndash; Multiple angiomatous nodules and plaques extending beyond the lower extremities</p><p/><p>Stage I to III disease was further subdivided into slow (group A) or rapid disease progression (group B, defined as an increase in the total number of <span class=\"nowrap\">plaques/nodules</span> or in the total area of plaques in the three months following an examination); all patients with stage IV disease were considered to have rapidly progressive disease.</p><p>In the original series of 300 patients, those classified as having stage I or II disease had a slower rate of progression, fewer complications, and a lower occurrence of GI <span class=\"nowrap\">tract/visceral</span> involvement. In contrast, patients with stage III or IV disease had more rapid disease progression and a greater likelihood of GI <span class=\"nowrap\">tract/visceral</span> involvement, local complications, and functional impairment. Rapid evolution was prevalent in the florid and disseminated stages (92 and 100 percent, respectively) and less frequent in the infiltrative and maculonodular stages (42 and 21 percent, respectively). Visceral involvement occurred only in patients with stage IIIB and IV disease (1.2 and 24 percent, respectively). Survival for the four groups was not reported.</p><p>The authors proposed using this classification scheme to select patients with the most aggressive natural history (ie, those with stages IIB, III, and IV disease) for systemic therapy. However, this staging system is not in widespread use. It is based upon subjective rather than objective classification of the extent of disease, and its prognostic value has not been independently validated. Furthermore, its predictive value for response to systemic therapy has not been addressed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the absence of treatments capable of eradicating latent human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) infection, one can question whether any form of Kaposi sarcoma (KS), including Classic KS (CKS), can be considered &quot;curable.&quot; Nonetheless, a number of strategies have been used to manage CKS, with the major therapeutic goals of achieving symptom palliation, alleviating lymphedema, improving function, decreasing the size of cutaneous or visceral lesions, and delaying or preventing disease progression.</p><p>With relatively few exceptions, the published literature on treatment of CKS consists of retrospective series and case reports. Prospectively designed phase II trials are scarce, usually include relatively few patients, and do not use standardized objective methods to document response. Furthermore, with a single exception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-features-staging-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], there are no prospectively randomized trials that compare different treatments for CKS, making it impossible to identify the &quot;best&quot; approach. This is not surprising given the relative scarcity of the disease, the advanced age of many affected individuals, and the frequent presence of comorbidities that may limit treatment options and the ability to participate in clinical trials.</p><p>Despite these limitations, some general principles have emerged about CKS treatment based on empirical evidence:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Observation without specific treatment is an option for patients who have a limited number of asymptomatic lesions that do not impair function, although disease progression eventually occurs in most patients. In a study of 39 patients with asymptomatic lesions who were observed without specific treatment, only 34 percent remained progression-free at two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-features-staging-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms related to limited lower extremity edema can be alleviated in many patients with elastic compression stockings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-features-staging-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When treatment is indicated, there are a variety of local and systemic tumor-directed therapy options, the choice of which depends on the extent, location, and pace of disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of regional nodal disease does not necessarily influence the choice of local versus systemic treatment. Unless the nodal disease is large and symptomatic (an uncommon scenario), we treat these patients based upon the volume and extent of their local skin disease.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Local treatments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These are treatments directed at specific lesions or groups of lesions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some cases, if there is a single symptomatic lesion (eg, bleeding or chafing against clothing), excision alone may provide sustained local tumor control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-features-staging-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/18,19,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19,29</a>], but new lesions commonly develop at other sites. Curettage of single KS nodules followed by topical application of hydrogen peroxide (to achieve hemostasis) is a safe, effective, and simple method for lesion control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-features-staging-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All forms of KS, including CKS, are very sensitive to radiotherapy (RT). However, because of the multifocal nature of the disease, the persistence of HHV-8 even with successful local lesion control, and the tendency for new lesions to develop in nonirradiated areas, there is no consensus as to the place of RT in the therapeutic armamentarium (particularly when to choose RT over systemic therapy) or as to the optimal radiation technique.</p><p>Several successful strategies have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-features-staging-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/18,31-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,31-41</a>]. High rates of tumor regression are reported using different energy sources (Cobalt-60, low-energy electrons, superficial X-rays) to deliver local (or, occasionally, extended-field) RT. There is marked variation in total RT doses (6 to 60 Gy) and in fractionation regimens, which range from doses of 6 to 12 Gy in a single fraction to larger total doses administered in smaller fractions over several weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-features-staging-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/18,31,32,34-38,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,31,32,34-38,41</a>]. One of the most commonly prescribed regimens is 30 Gy in 15 daily 2 Gy fractions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-features-staging-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>].</p><p>Although durable local lesion control and symptom relief can be achieved in over 90 percent of cases, most publications do not clearly address the frequency of out-of-field recurrences and the eventual need for additional local or systemic therapy. Treatment of solitary lesions as they arise may require irradiation of numerous adjacent fields and can lead to dosimetric problems at junction points. For this reason, although overall response rates are similar, some authors prefer a strategy of once-weekly, total or subtotal skin, electron beam therapy (for three to four sessions) over local involved-field RT because of the lower out-of-field recurrence rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-features-staging-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. One other frequently employed technique is treatment of the involved portion(s) of the feet and lower extremities, when extensively involved, using a water bath technique, which allows homogeneous radiation of a complex target. In one series using a split-course technique delivering 30 Gy in 10 fractions, disappearance of lesions was seen in 89 percent of patients, although limb edema only regressed in 57 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-features-staging-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Cryotherapy and laser therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related KS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-features-staging-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>], liquid nitrogen cryotherapy is sometimes used (mainly by dermatologists) for local control of small CKS lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classic-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-features-staging-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].
