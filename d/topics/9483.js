Some people with the condition have frequent, watery bowel movements (diarrhea). Others do not have enough bowel movements (constipation). Some patients switch back and forth between diarrhea and constipation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H478968099\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of IBS?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stomach pain and cramps, related to a bowel movement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea or constipation (some people switch back and forth between diarrhea and constipation)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bloating</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gas</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H478968106\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for IBS?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No, there is no specific test. But your doctor or nurse can figure out if you have IBS by asking you a few questions, and by running tests to make sure you do not have something other than IBS. Lots of medical conditions can cause the same symptoms as IBS. So it is important that your doctor or nurse checks the other possibilities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H478968113\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Start a diary to keep track of what you ate each day, what you did, and how you felt. That way, you can figure out if anything you do or eat makes your symptoms better or worse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop eating foods that might be making your IBS worse. Start by giving up foods that give you gas, and then give up milk, ice cream, and other foods that have traces of milk for 2 weeks. Ask your doctor or nurse for advice on which foods can make IBS worse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat more fiber, if you have constipation. You can do this by eating more fruits and vegetables. Or you can take fiber pills or powders. (If eating more fiber makes symptoms worse, cut back on the fiber.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise. Do something active for 20 to 60 minutes, 3 to 5 days a week. Studies show this helps improve IBS symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H478968120\"><span class=\"h1\">How is IBS treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medicines can ease the symptoms of IBS. But no treatment can cure the condition. Counseling might also help with IBS, because stress and worry can make the condition worse.</p><p>The medicines that can help with IBS symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to ease diarrhea</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to ease constipation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antidepressants &ndash; These medicines work by blocking pain. When used to treat IBS, they are given at a much lower dose than would normally be given to treat depression.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines called &quot;antispasmodics&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics &ndash; These medicines sometimes help with bloating and diarrhea in some people.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H478968127\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with IBS have the condition for the rest of their life. Even so, most people find ways to improve their symptoms. The key is to keep working with your doctor or nurse until the two of you find an approach that works.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H478968134\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=constipation-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Constipation in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diarrhea-in-adolescents-and-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diarrhea in adolescents and adults (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=irritable-bowel-syndrome-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Irritable bowel syndrome (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
