The most common techniques prevent pregnancy by occluding the fallopian tubes. This prevents conception by blocking transport of sperm from the lower genital tract to an ovulated oocyte. Female sterilization is the second-most common contraceptive method in the United States and the most common contraceptive method worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>This topic is an overview of female sterilization. Specific types of sterilization procedures, including postpartum sterilization or interval sterilization performed by laparoscopy or hysteroscopy, as well as other types of contraception, are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laparoscopic-female-sterilization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laparoscopic female sterilization&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-sterilization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum sterilization&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hysteroscopic-sterilization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hysteroscopic sterilization&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contraceptive-counseling-and-selection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contraceptive counseling and selection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11784843\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Female sterilization is the most common method of contraception worldwide, used by 19 percent of all women ages 15 to 49 years who are married or in a relationship union [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Reliance on female sterilization is highest in Asia (23.4 percent) and Latin America and the Caribbean (26 percent), and lowest in Africa (1.7 percent) and Europe (3.8 percent).</p><p>Female sterilization is one the most commonly used methods of contraception in the United States (US); 25.1 percent of contracepting women, or 15.5 percent of all women ages 15 to 44 (9.4 million women), rely on sterilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Female sterilization is second only to oral contraceptives, which are used by 25.9 percent of contraceptive users, or 16.0 percent of all women of childbearing age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Prevalence of having had a female sterilization increases with age, marital status (currently or previously married), and increasing parity. Higher rates of sterilization are also found among women with public insurance or no insurance, African-American women, and Hispanic women not born in the US. Rates of sterilization decrease with increasing levels of education and income.</p><p>There were approximately 643,000 sterilization procedures in the US in 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Rates of female sterilization in the US peaked in the late 1970s, then plateaued in the 1980s. Interval sterilization (done outside the postpartum period) decreased by 12 percent from 1995 to 2006, while postpartum sterilizations have remained stable at approximately 8 to 9 percent of all US live births.</p><p>There are no available data on the proportions of various methods of sterilization (laparoscopic versus hysteroscopic) for interval sterilization within the US as a whole, and it is reported that approximately 750,000 women worldwide have now had hysteroscopic sterilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A study of over 52,000 interval sterilization procedures in New York State between the years 2005 and 2013 reports that the frequency of hysteroscopic sterilizations increased over that time period from 0.6 to 25.9 percent of all identified cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11784877\"><span class=\"h1\">CANDIDATES FOR STERILIZATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H874577446\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications and contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The only indication for sterilization is the patient's desire for permanent contraception. Ultimately, the choice is made by the patient, but the decision requires thorough counseling about permanent sterility and the risk of regret.</p><p>There are no medical conditions that are strictly incompatible with sterilization; however, there may be factors that make women more suitable to a particular route of sterilization or other contraceptive options. (See <a href=\"#H20183966\" class=\"local\">'Assessing surgical risk'</a> below and <a href=\"#H11785695\" class=\"local\">'Choosing a sterilization approach'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1311207912\"><span class=\"h2\">United States regulatory issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are legal restrictions regarding sterilization in some healthcare settings.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age &ndash; In the United States, federal funding prohibits sterilization of women under the age of 21 years and women who are deemed to be mentally incompetent (see <a href=\"#H1311209639\" class=\"local\">'Women with mental illness or disability'</a> below). There is some variation by state, with some individual states funding sterilizations for women 18 to 21 years. Clinicians should be aware of their state regulations. The restrictions against sterilization of younger women generally do not apply to women with private insurance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Timing of consent &ndash; For women who have federally funded health insurance, the United States federal sterilization consent form must be reviewed, signed, and dated between 30 and 180 days prior to the sterilization procedure. Some states may allow this waiting period to be waived to 72 hours; each provider should be aware of local or institutional policies related to the federal sterilization consent form.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H874577706\"><span class=\"h1\">STERILIZATION VERSUS OTHER CONTRACEPTIVES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who do not desire future childbearing may also choose methods of contraception other than sterilization. In general, women who are considering sterilization desire a contraceptive method that is highly effective and does not require frequent dosing. Thus, long-acting reversible contraceptives or male sterilization are the most likely alternatives.</p><p>In general, for all current female sterilization methods, the failure rate is &lt;1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This is comparable with either male sterilization or female long-acting reversible contraception methods. Thus, efficacy is not usually the deciding factor and patients typically choose a method based upon other factors, such as convenience or degree of invasiveness if a procedure is required. (See <a href=\"#H11785695\" class=\"local\">'Choosing a sterilization approach'</a> below.)</p><p>If sterilization is desired and the woman is in an ongoing sexual relationship with a man, ideally the choice between female or male sterilization should be discussed between the partners.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H874577724\"><span class=\"h2\">Long-acting reversible contraceptives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Long-acting reversible contraceptives include intrauterine devices (IUD) and progestin implants. These methods and female sterilization are comparable in terms of efficacy and safety. In general, sterilization is likely to be preferred by women who prefer permanent contraception and are willing to undergo a surgical procedure. Long-acting reversible contraceptives are likely to be chosen by women who have not completely ruled out the possibility of a future pregnancy, prefer a minor office procedure and do not mind having to repeat the procedure every several years, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> who have heavy uterine bleeding and may benefit from progestin therapy that is delivered by a long-acting contraceptive method.</p><p>Regarding efficacy for female sterilization, the pregnancy rate over 10 years is 1.85 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Long-term contraceptive options have the following failure rates:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are two types of IUDs that release 52 mcg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a> (LNg): One version is used over five years (LNg <span class=\"nowrap\">52/5;</span> Mirena) and has a cumulative five-year failure rate of 0.5 to 1.1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]; the other is used over three (LNg <span class=\"nowrap\">52/3;</span> Liletta) and has a three-year failure rate of 0.55 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etonogestrel-contraceptive-implant\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etonogestrel contraceptive implant&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>To continue the contraceptive effect, long-acting methods must be replaced every 3 to 10 years. The reversibility of these methods may be an advantage for some patients, while others prefer permanent contraception.</p><p>The benefit of an IUD or progestin implant compared with sterilization is that the patient avoids surgery. However, the surgical risk and degree of invasiveness for hysteroscopic sterilization done without anesthesia is not much greater than for placement of an IUD.</p><p>Both sterilization and IUDs are associated with an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy in the rare cases in which the method fails. No studies have directly compared this risk, but among women who do become pregnant, the risk of ectopic pregnancy appears to be comparable following sterilization or an LNg IUD and lower for a copper IUD. In the United States Collaborative Review of Sterilization (CREST), a landmark study of outcomes following female sterilization, approximately 1 in 3 pregnancies that occurred after sterilization were ectopic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/8,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,14</a>]. For users of the TCU380A copper IUD, the risk of an ectopic pregnancy when pregnancy occurs is approximately 1 in 16, while for two of the LNg IUDs (LNg 52 mcg over five years [LNg <span class=\"nowrap\">52/5,</span> Mirena; LNg <span class=\"nowrap\">52/3,</span> Liletta] and 13.5 mcg over five years [LNg <span class=\"nowrap\">14/3;</span> Skyla]), that rate is approximately 1 in 2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/11,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,15</a>].</p><p>Additionally, for some women, there may be significant noncontraceptive benefits of a progestin-releasing IUD or progestin implant, such as reduced menstrual flow, decreased dysmenorrhea, and endometrial protection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding#H1539652510\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of abnormal uterine bleeding&quot;, section on 'Levonorgestrel IUD versus surgical treatments'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H874577994\"><span class=\"h2\">Vasectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vasectomy appears to be the safest method of permanent sterilization, and efficacy rates are comparable with female sterilization. Vasectomy is also the most cost-effective method of permanent contraception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Given its safety and efficacy profile, vasectomy should be a preferred method of sterilization across both sexes but is significantly underutilized. While 25.1 percent of contracepting women rely on female sterilization, only 8.2 percent rely on male sterilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Vasectomy requires the male partner's willingness to undergo the procedure and assumes that the woman will not have any other male partners. Similar to hysteroscopic sterilization, it is not effective right away and requires back-up contraception until azoospermia is confirmed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vasectomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Long-term data for the efficacy of vasectomy are limited, and outcomes depend on whether there is confirmation of azoospermia. Pregnancy rates at one year with confirmed azoospermia have been reported as low as 0.02 percent and as high as 0.74 percent in retrospective surveys of women whose partners have had vasectomies but in which assessment of sperm count is not documented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/13,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,17</a>]. In this latter group, the pregnancy rate was 1.1 percent at two, three, and five years.</p><p>Vasectomy is generally regarded as the safest method of permanent sterilization. Mortality rates are estimated at 0.<span class=\"nowrap\">5/100,000,</span> major complications at 1 in 1250, and minor complications 1 to 6 percent. In one review, vasectomy was estimated to have 12 times lower mortality and 20 times lower major morbidity than tubal ligation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. This comparison, however, is based on older data when the main driver of major complications for laparoscopic tubal ligation was conversion to laparotomy. With improvements in gynecologic laparoscopic skill over time, this complication has now become much less common. Nevertheless, it remains reasonable to assume that vasectomy, which is an outpatient procedure done without anesthesia, has lower morbidity and mortality than female sterilization via minilaparotomy or laparoscopy. Though there are no available direct comparisons, the major risks associated with hysteroscopic sterilization, also generally an outpatient procedure and without general anesthesia, are likely comparable with vasectomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11785695\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOOSING A STERILIZATION APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical planning for female sterilization includes choosing the timing, surgical approach, and tubal occlusion method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. These decisions are made based upon patient preference, recent pregnancy, surgical history, and medical comorbidities.</p><p>Sterilization procedures vary by timing, surgical route (abdominal versus hysteroscopic), and tubal occlusion method. Timing in relation to pregnancy is a major factor in determining the surgical approach of a sterilization procedure. The surgical approach determines the tubal occlusion method.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11785715\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing and surgical approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnant women may choose to undergo postpartum or interval sterilization. If an interval procedure is chosen or the patient is not pregnant, then a laparoscopic or hysteroscopic approach may be chosen. Women who have an early pregnancy failure or undesired pregnancy may opt for a postabortion laparoscopic sterilization.</p><p>Once the timing of sterilization is decided, the surgical approach can then be chosen. Postpartum sterilization is typically performed via either laparotomy at the time of cesarean delivery or minilaparotomy following vaginal delivery. Interval sterilization is generally performed via laparoscopy or hysteroscopy.</p><p>For each surgical approach, there are one are more techniques for tubal occlusion. Methods of tubal occlusion for each surgical approach are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laparoscopic-female-sterilization#H102175684\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laparoscopic female sterilization&quot;, section on 'Tubal occlusion techniques'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-sterilization#H1311209845\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum sterilization&quot;, section on 'Tubal occlusion methods'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hysteroscopic-sterilization#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hysteroscopic sterilization&quot;, section on 'Hysteroscopic sterilization device'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Postpartum sterilization</strong> &ndash; Postpartum sterilization is typically performed at the time of cesarean delivery or within the first 24 to 48 hours after vaginal delivery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cesarean delivery with concomitant sterilization is performed through the cesarean laparotomy incision.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Following vaginal delivery, an infraumbilical minilaparotomy is typically performed, since the uterine fundus is usually at the level of the umbilicus at this time and the tubes are easily accessible through this incision site.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The method of tubal occlusion for sterilization via laparotomy generally involves excision of a segment of the fallopian tube (eg, Pomeroy method). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-sterilization#H1311209845\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum sterilization&quot;, section on 'Tubal occlusion methods'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Interval sterilization</strong> &ndash; Interval sterilization is defined as sterilization performed outside the postpartum period. This is defined as six weeks after birth, but in reality, postpartum sterilization procedures are typically performed within 48 hours of delivery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Interval tubal sterilization can be accomplished by several surgical approaches; however, laparoscopic methods are used most commonly in the United States and other high-resource countries. This is in part due to the availability of resources to purchase and maintain laparoscopic equipment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Options for a surgical approach for interval sterilization are:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Laparoscopy &ndash; In current practice, laparoscopy is the surgical approach used in the majority of patients who undergo interval sterilization via a transabdominal approach. Laparoscopic methods typically include the placement of clips or rings on the tubes or electrosurgery. However, salpingectomy may also be performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laparoscopic-female-sterilization#H102175684\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laparoscopic female sterilization&quot;, section on 'Tubal occlusion techniques'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hysteroscopy &ndash; Hysteroscopic sterilization is performed by transcervical placement of a device into the fallopian tube lumen. The device stimulates tissue growth, which results in tubal occlusion. Contraception is required for three months post-procedure until tubal occlusion is confirmed. Traditionally, laparotomy or minilaparotomy rather than laparoscopy was performed for sterilization if the patient had risk factors for surgical complications. However, since the introduction of hysteroscopic sterilization, this method has generally replaced laparotomy in developed countries for women with potential peritoneal adhesions or other issues that would make laparoscopic sterilization difficult. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hysteroscopic-sterilization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hysteroscopic sterilization&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Minilaparotomy &ndash; This approach may be used for interval sterilization, particularly in developing countries. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-sterilization#H1813257393\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum sterilization&quot;, section on 'Interval laparotomy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A vaginal approach with colpotomy or culdoscopy is rarely used in current practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In some settings, hysterectomy has been used for the sterilization. If there are other indications for hysterectomy such as abnormal bleeding, pelvic pain, or pelvic organ prolapse that have been appropriately evaluated, some women might find sterilization to be a secondary benefit of hysterectomy. However, we do not believe that sterilization alone is a sufficient indication for hysterectomy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Postabortion sterilization</strong> &ndash; Postabortion sterilization is typically performed via laparoscopy immediately following uterine evacuation. Surveillance data from the 1970s reported that approximately 3.5 percent of sterilizations were done after an elective or spontaneous abortion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. There are no subsequent large studies of postabortion sterilization rates, but they are likely lower because a greater proportion of abortion care is performed in ambulatory clinic settings, where laparoscopy is not available. When providers are able to provide both laparoscopic sterilization and surgical abortion, postabortion sterilization is a safe and effective method of postabortion contraception. Hysteroscopic sterilization cannot be performed until six weeks following spontaneous or induced abortion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-contraception-initiation-and-methods\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum contraception: Initiation and methods&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11785721\"><span class=\"h2\">Postpartum versus interval</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who express a desire for sterilization during their pregnancy may be candidates for either a postpartum sterilization or an interval procedure. For pregnant women who are certain that they desire permanent contraception, a postpartum procedure is usually more convenient and avoids unplanned pregnancy in the case that the procedure is deferred. For nonpregnant women, interval sterilization is the only option.</p><p>The decision between a postpartum or interval sterilization procedure should be based primarily on patient preference, but may also be subject to logistical issues in the provision and availability of postpartum sterilization. While there may be small statistical differences in efficacy and safety between postpartum and interval sterilization, the clinical relevance of these differences is negligible.</p><p>In terms of efficacy, all currently used sterilization methods have five- to 10-year post-sterilization pregnancy rates of &lt;1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Based upon the Collaborative Review of Sterilization (CREST) study and other subsequent studies, the efficacy of postpartum sterilization via partial salpingectomy is slightly higher than interval laparoscopic sterilization overall, but slightly lower than hysteroscopic sterilization (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F54215\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54215 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. As noted above, these small differences are not likely to be clinically relevant to any individual's decision-making, especially if being compared or weighed against other less-effective methods of contraception. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laparoscopic-female-sterilization#H1732916946\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laparoscopic female sterilization&quot;, section on 'Efficacy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hysteroscopic-sterilization#H32\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hysteroscopic sterilization&quot;, section on 'Contraceptive efficacy'</a>.)</p><p>In term of safety, a meta-analysis of randomized trials compared surgical approach for female sterilization procedures (minilaparotomy versus laparoscopic versus <span class=\"nowrap\">culdotomy/culdoscopy)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Minilaparotomy is typically used for postpartum sterilization and laparoscopy for interval sterilization, as noted above. The analysis concluded that major morbidity rates were similar following either minilaparotomy or laparoscopy for sterilization. Minilaparotomy compared with laparoscopy had a higher minor morbidity rate (odds ratio 1.89; 95% CI 1.38-2.59), but laparoscopy required a higher level of training and surgical skill and more equipment compared with open techniques. Culdoscopy, a method no longer routinely performed, was associated with the highest rates of morbidity.</p><p>Interval laparoscopy also appeared to be marginally safer than minilaparotomy in one of the largest comparative studies of postpartum minilaparotomy (n = 5095) and interval laparoscopic sterilization (n = 20,325) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. There was a statistically significant increase in rates of complications for postpartum minilaparotomy compared with interval laparoscopy (0.39 versus 0.10 percent for major complications and 0.82 versus 0.26 percent for minor complications).</p><p>The risk of regret is higher following postpartum sterilization than interval sterilization, particularly concomitant with cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Providers should ensure that patients have been carefully counseled about the permanence of sterilization during their antenatal care, and have made a decision prior to the highly emotional moments of childbirth. (See <a href=\"#H20185900\" class=\"local\">'Sterilization regret'</a> below.)</p><p>In some cases, a desired postpartum sterilization is deferred due to obstetric complications, concern about neonatal health, or logistical issues regarding performing the procedure within 24 to 48 hours after delivery (eg, availability of operating room, personnel). The greatest risk of postponing a postpartum tubal sterilization in favor of an interval procedure is the risk of not obtaining the subsequent procedure, potentially resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. In one study that compared women with unfulfilled postpartum sterilization requests to women with live births who did not request sterilization, those who had requested sterilization had a pregnancy rate of 46.7 percent within one year, compared with 22.3 percent in the control group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Risks of unplanned and undesired pregnancy must therefore be strongly considered in the decision regarding timing of sterilization. In the absence of significant health and safety concerns, every effort should be made to provide in-hospital postpartum sterilization rather than planning for interval sterilization.

The largest of these include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective study based on insurance claims data from 2007 to 2013 compared women who underwent hysteroscopic sterilization (n = 27,724) with women who underwent laparoscopic sterilization (n = 42,391) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The study found that hysteroscopic sterilization was associated with a statistically significantly higher pregnancy rate among all study subjects (2.4 versus 2.0 percent at two years; 4.2 versus 3.7 percent at five years); however, for women who underwent hysteroscopic sterilization and had a hysterosalpingogram within six months (66.1 percent), the pregnancy rate was comparable to laparoscopic sterilization (1.8 and 2.0 percent at two years). In post-sterilization procedure pregnancies, rates of ectopic pregnancy were lower after hysteroscopic (1.3 percent) than laparoscopic (4.9 percent) sterilization. In the hysteroscopic sterilization group, 3.8 percent had a second hysteroscopic sterilization procedure, and among this subset, 0.4 percent subsequently underwent laparoscopic sterilization. In the laparoscopic group, 0.6 percent underwent a second laparoscopic sterilization. At two years, hysteroscopic sterilization was associated with an increased rate of abnormal uterine bleeding (26.8 versus 22,3 percent) and a lower rate of pelvic pain (21.0 versus 25.6 percent). Hysteroscopic sterilization was also associated with increased rates of other hysteroscopic surgery at two years (13.8 versus 6.4 percent) but a lower rate of intra-abdominal gynecologic surgery including hysterectomy (10.9 versus 14.3 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective population-based cohort study, found no difference in short-term efficacy between the two methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Hysteroscopy had fewer intraoperative complications, but the rate of reoperation was higher. The study compared 8048 women who underwent hysteroscopic sterilization and 44,278 who underwent laparoscopic sterilization. At one year, there was no significant difference in rates of unintended pregnancy (hysteroscopy 1.2 versus laparoscopy 1.1 percent). There were significantly lower rates of iatrogenic complications at 30 days with hysteroscopic sterilization (0.2 versus 0.4 percent); however, there were higher rates of reoperation following hysteroscopy (2.4 versus 0.2 percent, at one year), and this increase persisted at two and three years of follow-up. This study had several limitations including differences in the characteristics between the two groups, reliance on billing data, and relatively short-term follow-up. Potential differences in long-term outcomes between laparoscopic and hysteroscopic sterilization warrants further investigation.</p><p/><p>An advantage of laparoscopic sterilization is that it is immediately effective and no back-up contraception is needed. In contrast, after successful hysteroscopic sterilization device placement, back-up contraception is required for three months. This is because the device itself does not occlude the tube; the device stimulates the growth of tissue that surrounds and infiltrates the device, resulting in tubal occlusion. At three months, the patient is required to return for a hysterosalpingogram (HSG) to confirm tubal occlusion. A small proportion of women will need to continue with alternative contraception for another three months and repeat the HSG at six months. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hysteroscopic-sterilization#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hysteroscopic sterilization&quot;, section on 'Confirming occlusion'</a>.)</p><p>Other factors that guide the choice of hysteroscopic or laparoscopic sterilization include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient preference &ndash; Because of the minimally invasive nature of hysteroscopy, this method of sterilization may be preferred by women who want to avoid an abdominal incision or general anesthesia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relative contraindication to abdominal surgery &ndash; Hysteroscopy may also be preferable, in particular, for women with extensive pelvic adhesions or in women with comorbidities that preclude laparoscopy or laparotomy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Operative setting and perioperative interventions &ndash; Both laparoscopy and hysteroscopy are minimally invasive and typically can be performed as an outpatient procedure. However, laparoscopy is a more major procedure and does require abdominal incisions.

In the 2013 New York cohort, however, hysteroscopic procedures had shorter duration, less frequent use of general anesthesia, and yet higher total charges (USD $7832 versus $5068) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Future medical restrictions &ndash; The presence of the hysteroscopic microinserts limits the use of unipolar electrosurgery for subsequent pelvic procedures (eg, some types of endometrial ablation).

Neither is recommended in the immediate postpartum period; however, laparoscopic sterilization can safely be performed at the time of a uterine evacuation for induced or spontaneous abortion. Combining abortion and laparoscopic sterilization appears to add no significant morbidity above performing the two procedures separately, and can result in time and cost savings, as well as assurance of reliable postabortion contraception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]. It is not feasible to perform a concomitant abortion and hysteroscopic sterilization because visualization of the tubal ostia is limited in the recently evacuated uterus.

Rates also appear higher in population-based studies that assess prevalence rather than clinic-based studies that measure incidence. Despite these variations in expressed regret, rates of request for reversal appear more consistent, with most studies finding rates between 1 to 4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Young age at time of sterilization is a strong predictor for sterilization regret, seeking information about sterilization reversal, obtaining a reversal, or undergoing a post-sterilization IVF procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Age as a predictor of regret has been shown and is consistent across a large number of studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. The largest United States study (CREST) included interviews with 11,232 women ages 18 to 44 years who underwent sterilization between 1978 and 1987 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The 14-year cumulative risk of regret was 20.3 percent among women &le;30 years and 5.9 percent among women &gt;30 years. The results of CREST also showed that women 30 or younger were 1.9 times (95% CI 1.6-2.3) more likely to report regret compared with those over the age of 30, after adjustment for other factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In terms of reversal, the 14-year cumulative probability of obtaining a reversal was 2.1 percent among women &le;30 (95% CI 0.9-3.4) and 0.2 percent among women &gt;30 (95% CI 0.0-0.3), which, after adjusting for other factors, made women age &le;30 7.6 times more likely (95% CI 3.2-18.3) to undergo reversal than those sterilized at an age &gt;30.</p><p>There is no exact threshold age at which the risk of sterilization regret reaches a low rate, or a specific age at which sterilization is or is not appropriate; rather, the risk of regret appears to decrease incrementally with increasing age. This was shown in a study of 846 Puerto Rican women who had undergone contraceptive sterilization, where women's risk of regret increased by 10 percent for every one year decrease in age for women ages 17 to 44 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. This incremental relationship was also seen in a case-control study from Brazil comparing women seeking sterilization reversal with those who had never requested reversal, where multivariate analysis revealed that the risk of requesting reversal decreased by 21 percent (odds ratio [OR] 0.79, CI 0.73-0.85) for each increasing year of age at surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Studies that have included very young women have shown the highest risk of regret <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> request for reversal in this age group. For example, one analysis from CREST showed that the cumulative 14-year probability of requesting reversal was 40.4 percent among those sterilized between the ages of 18 to 24, 15.6 percent among those 25 to 30, 8.2 percent among those 31 to 35, and 4.4 percent among those over the age of 35 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>Thus, all women should be carefully counseled about the association between age and regret, as this may be very relevant to their individual sterilization decision. If a provider has any concern about the patient's understanding of the permanence of sterilization or the risk of regret, or is concerned that the patient is not making the decision independently or is being coerced, additional measures such as a social work referral may be appropriate.</p><p>Other risk factors for regret from the 14-year cumulative CREST data include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-white race: Non-white race was found to have an adjusted risk ratio of 1.3 (95% CI 1.1-1.5).

Unmarried status combined with young age also produced high cumulative rates of regret at 31.0 percent over the 14-year study period. Young women 18 to 30 were also more likely to cite divorce or remarriage as a reason for regret than women greater than 30 (23.9 versus 8 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postpartum sterilization &ndash; Women who undergo postpartum sterilization are more likely to experience regret than those undergoing interval sterilization or those who have had no previous births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Compared with women with no previous births or those undergoing sterilization at least eight years after the birth of their youngest child, women with a postpartum sterilization had risk ratios of 1.6 (95% CI 1.2-2.1) after vaginal birth and 2.0 (95% CI 1.5-2.8) after cesarean delivery.

Marital discord <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> changes in marital status after sterilization have been shown to be risk factors for regret in other studies as well, and being unmarried or remarried is also associated with seeking reversal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/25,50,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,50,53</a>]. In a study comparing women's regret after tubal sterilization versus partner vasectomy, there was no difference between mode of sterilization; however, conflict between spouses regarding the sterilization decision was shown to be a strong risk factor for regret and request for reversal of both procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. It is also important to note that as marital patterns and the social value of marriage change with time, the impact of marriage versus non-marriage, as it was defined in the CREST data, might be a less valuable risk factor than some other assessment of relationship stability.</p><p>Factors that have been inconsistently associated with regret include low socioeconomic status, low educational attainment, low labor force activity, and living in a rural area. In many studies, these risk factors were no longer significant when age at sterilization was taken into account [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

This may not be a good measure of regret, however, because there are many barriers to obtaining a tubal reversal or IVF, including limited availability, need to undergo an invasive procedure, and expense. In CREST, the likelihood of obtaining reversal was 2.1 percent among women aged &le;30 years at the time of sterilization and 0.2 percent among women &gt;30 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The probability of ongoing pregnancy after tubal reversal is age-related, with estimated ongoing pregnancy rates of 63 percent for women under age 35, 44 percent between ages 35 and 40, and only 5 percent for women over 40 years old. </p><p>A decision analysis compared both cost and efficacy of tubal reanastomosis (sterilization reversal) and IVF and reported that tubal anastomosis would be preferred for women &lt;41 years old and that IVF would be preferred for women &ge;41 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].

However, there is still a small risk of luteal phase pregnancy if the procedure is performed after the estimated date of ovulation; patients should be counseled about this risk.</p><p>Luteal phase pregnancy has been estimated to occur in 0.23 to 1.7 percent of interval sterilization procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/48,58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,58,59</a>].

Adverse effects, including dysmenorrhea, cycle irregularity, and menorrhagia, have not been demonstrated. Based upon the available data, sterilization appears to be associated with primarily improvements, but also some adverse effects on menstrual function and symptoms. The Collaborative Review of Sterilization (CREST) study compared women who had undergone sterilization with those who had not (and whose partner had a vasectomy) at five years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Female sterilization was associated with a modest decrease in the volume of flow and duration of menstrual bleeding and less menstrual pain; however, there was an increase in cycle irregularity. Harlow and colleagues published a cross-sectional study of 976 women to identify any changes in menstrual characteristics between women with and without prior tubal ligation. Though the analysis suggested that sterilization may be associated with an increase in menstrual flow, the effect was limited only to women with a prior cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Analysis demonstrated higher rates of abnormal uterine bleeding at two years following hysteroscopic sterilization compared with laparoscopic sterilization (26.8 versus 22.3 percent); however, the reason for this observed difference is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1659814429\"><span class=\"h2\">Postablation tubal sterilization syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some women who have undergone tubal ligation prior to endometrial ablation experience cyclic or intermittent pelvic pain; this is referred to as postablation tubal sterilization syndrome.

The risk of hysterectomy in the CREST population was not associated with the type of technique used for sterilization, age at sterilization, history of prior pelvic surgery, or other gynecologic conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Among women in the Kaiser cohort, there was a suggestion of increased risk of pelvic pain and menstrual complaints following tubal ligation; however, higher risk of hysterectomy was not associated with occlusion methods using higher tissue-destructive techniques, arguing against a biologic effect of the sterilization procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].

Clinicians must remember that their ethical duty is to do no harm, and be aware both of the potential for coercion of vulnerable patients as well the inappropriateness of blanket denials for sterilization because of a patient's disability.

For example, federal funds may not be used for sterilization of those deemed &quot;mentally incompetent&quot; or institutionalized.</p><p>Clinicians must first do their best to ascertain the patient's own desires and wishes regarding childbearing, as well as their capacity for decision-making. In situations of chronic mental illness where decision-making capacity may be variable over time, the clinician should do their best to evaluate the patient at a time when their mental state and medications are maximized. When appropriate, the clinician should also seek counsel of the patient's family and caregivers. Standards for legal competence are complex, and requirements for court approval are variable as well. Clinicians need to ensure they are aware of local laws and regulations. We recommend that clinicians seek ethical and legal counsel in any situation in which there is not complete agreement between patient, caregivers, and the provider, in any guardianship arrangement, or in any situation in which the patient is not able to be involved in the consent process at all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-female-sterilization/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1311209659\"><span class=\"h2\">Ovarian cancer prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complete salpingectomy has been proposed as a strategy to reduce the risk of ovarian, tubal, and peritoneal cancers.

Female sterilization is the most common method of contraception worldwide, used by 19 percent of all women ages 15 to 49 years. (See <a href=\"#H11784815\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11784843\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women considering sterilization should be counseled regarding the risks and benefits of other contraceptive options including vasectomy. (See <a href=\"#H874577706\" class=\"local\">'Sterilization versus other contraceptives'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Long-acting reversible contraceptives are one alternative (eg, intrauterine device, hormonal implant). In general, sterilization is likely to be preferred by women who prefer permanent contraception and are willing to undergo a surgical procedure. Long-acting reversible contraceptives are likely to be chosen by women who have not completely ruled out the possibility of a future pregnancy, prefer a minor office procedure and do not mind having to repeat the procedure every several years, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> who have heavy uterine bleeding and benefit from progestin therapy. (See <a href=\"#H874577724\" class=\"local\">'Long-acting reversible contraceptives'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Vasectomy appears to be the safest method of permanent sterilization. Efficacy rates are comparable with female sterilization. (See <a href=\"#H874577994\" class=\"local\">'Vasectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Counseling and informed consent for female sterilization should include a detailed discussion of efficacy, the permanent nature of the procedure, risk of regret, limited options for reversal, risk of complications, and the risk of ectopic pregnancy if a method failure occurs. (See <a href=\"#H103521971\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative counseling'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors for regret following sterilization include young age, non-white race, marital status, postpartum timing for sterilization, and insurance status. Parity and postabortion timing of sterilization are not associated with regret. (See <a href=\"#H20185807\" class=\"local\">'Sterilization reversal'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women who express a desire for sterilization during their pregnancy may be candidates for either a postpartum sterilization or an interval procedure. For pregnant women who are certain that they desire permanent contraception, a postpartum procedure is usually more convenient and avoids unplanned pregnancy if the procedure is deferred. (See <a href=\"#H11785721\" class=\"local\">'Postpartum versus interval'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to interval sterilization, an existing pregnancy should be excluded. (See <a href=\"#H20184059\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation in pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women undergoing interval sterilization may choose laparoscopic or hysteroscopic sterilization, taking into consideration patient preference and surgical risk factors. All women should be thoroughly counseled about the risks, benefits, and requirements for follow-up for hysteroscopic and laparoscopic sterilization. For interval sterilization, we make the following recommendations (see <a href=\"#H11785871\" class=\"local\">'Laparoscopy versus hysteroscopy'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For those who have an increased risk of complications with laparoscopy (eg, comorbidities, obesity, pelvic adhesions), we recommend hysteroscopic rather than laparoscopic sterilization (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). The exceptions to this are women with a nickel allergy or those with a history of a chronic pain condition.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women with history of a chronic pain condition, we suggest laparoscopic sterilization (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Women who prefer immediately effective sterilization require laparoscopic sterilization, provided they have no contraindications to this procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Female sterilization is not associated with a marked increase in subsequent menstrual symptoms including dysmenorrhea or menorrhagia. There also appears to be no impact on sexual function, ovarian reserve, or incidence of breast cancer. Women who have undergone tubal sterilization have a higher likelihood of subsequent hysterectomy.
