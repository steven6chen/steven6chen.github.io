In a randomized trial, children who received 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) during infancy had a 34 percent lower risk of tympanostomy tube insertion at age two through five years than those who received hepatitis B vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-prevention-of-recurrence/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Randomized trials and systematic reviews have not found administration of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines after the development of recurrent otitis media to be beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-prevention-of-recurrence/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>]. This is primarily because the importance of pneumococcal disease decreases as children with recurrent otitis media get older. PCV13 has not been specifically studied in children with recurrent otitis media. Despite the lack of evidence, we suggest PCV13 for children younger than six years who continue to have recurrent episodes of AOM and have not previously received PCV13. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumococcal-streptococcus-pneumoniae-conjugate-vaccines-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pneumococcal (Streptococcus pneumoniae) conjugate vaccines in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In randomized trials, administration of the PCV7 beginning at age two months was associated with a modest reduction in AOM (6 to 8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-prevention-of-recurrence/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. However, the efficacy of prevention of culture-confirmed pneumococcal AOM caused by a vaccine serotype was 57 to 65 percent. In these and other randomized and observational studies, receipt of PCV7 was associated with fewer medical visits for AOM and fewer tympanostomy tube placements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-children-prevention-of-recurrence/abstract/19,25,26,28-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,25,26,28-34</a>].

In meta-analysis of two trials (1223 children), influenza vaccine also appeared to reduce the number of antibiotic prescriptions (RD 11 percent, 95% CI 6-16; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.59-0.83), but it is unclear whether this reduction was due to influenza vaccine or increased frequency of &quot;watchful waiting&quot; for AOM to avoid overuse of antibiotics. It is not surprising that influenza vaccine has only a modest impact on AOM episodes, because infection with other respiratory viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenzae, and human metapneumovirus, appear to have a much greater association with AOM.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

Infants who have their first episode of AOM before six months of age or who have siblings with severe and recurrent AOM are at risk for severe and recurrent AOM. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevention strategies include identification and treatment of underlying conditions that predispose to recurrent AOM, parental education about the risk factors for AOM, vaccine administration, chemoprophylaxis, and tympanostomy tube placement. (See <a href=\"#H52372127\" class=\"local\">'Interventions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factors that influence the choice of prevention strategy include the age of the child, the age at first episode of AOM, the time of year, day care attendance, family history, cognitive and language status, underlying conditions that predispose to AOM, and the effects of recurrent AOM on the quality of life for the child and family. (See <a href=\"#H52372134\" class=\"local\">'Factors influencing choice'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of predisposing conditions and parental education are reasonable strategies for all children with recurrent AOM. (See <a href=\"#H54646609\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of predisposing conditions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Education'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend administration of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) and annual influenza vaccine according to the routine childhood immunization schedule (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). We suggest that children with recurrent AOM who are between two and six years of age and have not received any doses of the 13-valent PCV (PCV13), receive a dose of PCV13 (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We also suggest that children older than two years of age with recurrent AOM receive a dose of the 23-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine at least eight weeks after PCV13 (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Vaccines'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seasonal-influenza-in-children-prevention-with-vaccines#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seasonal influenza in children: Prevention with vaccines&quot;, section on 'Target groups'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumococcal-streptococcus-pneumoniae-conjugate-vaccines-in-children#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pneumococcal (Streptococcus pneumoniae) conjugate vaccines in children&quot;, section on 'Otitis media'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest antibiotic prophylaxis or tympanostomy tube placement for children with recurrent AOM who are younger than two years of age, have multiple risk factors for recurrent AOM, have underlying medical conditions that predispose to AOM, or have known or suspected developmental or language delays (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). However, the ultimate decision about whether to use one of these more aggressive interventions and which intervention to use is made on a case-by-case basis after discussion of the potential benefits and risks with the caregivers. (See <a href=\"#H77986258\" class=\"local\">'Choice of intervention(s)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the decision is made to use antibiotic prophylaxis, we typically use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">amoxicillin</a> 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> orally once per day. Sulfisoxazole 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> orally once per day is an alternative. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be provided every day during the fall, winter, and early spring months. Children receiving chemoprophylaxis should be examined approximately every two months to determine the presence and duration of middle ear effusion. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tympanostomy tube placement is an alternative to antibiotic prophylaxis for children who warrant more aggressive prevention strategies and an option for those who have had breakthrough episodes of AOM while receiving antibiotic prophylaxis. (See <a href=\"#H77986258\" class=\"local\">'Choice of intervention(s)'</a> above and <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Tympanostomy tubes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adenoidectomy is not an effective primary preventive measure for children with recurrent AOM but may be beneficial in those who continue to have recurrent AOM after extrusion of tubes and are undergoing repeat tympanostomy tube placement. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Adenoidectomy or adenotonsillectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We do not suggest xylitol, antiadhesive oligosaccharide, or probiotics for the prevention of recurrent AOM in children (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
