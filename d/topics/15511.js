The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that 7.1 percent of abortions were performed between 14 to 20 weeks and 1.3 percent at or after 21 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-induction-medication-termination/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Induction abortion (also referred to as medication or medical abortion) is performed by inducing labor with medications. Women have historically relied upon a variety of herbal and other substances to stimulate labor to abort an undesired pregnancy. Women may choose medication abortion if they prefer more awareness of the termination process, if they prefer an intact fetus, or they want to avoid surgery. An intact fetus may be desirable if the patient desires to hold the fetus or, in cases of fetal anomalies, if an intact fetus is beneficial for a morphologic evaluation. In some healthcare settings, there is more access to second-trimester induction abortion than surgical abortion.</p><p>Second-trimester induction termination is reviewed here. An overview of second-trimester pregnancy termination and the technique for surgical abortion are discussed separately. First trimester medication abortion is also discussed separately.

Many of the medical factors favoring medical abortion are &quot;provider-dependent&quot; in that they derive from a specific provider&rsquo;s skill in a particular situation.</p><p>Choice of procedure is discussed in detail separately.

Most states restrict abortion after viability, although the definition of viability varies by state and maternal-fetal exemptions that countermand the viability statute vary by state. Physicians offering abortion must be familiar with restrictions in their own locality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4801490\"><span class=\"h2\">Prophylactic antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prophylactic antibiotics are not typically advised for second-trimester medication abortion. The Society of Family Planning (SFP) advises that prophylactic antibiotics may lower the risk of serious infection, but advises against universal use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-induction-medication-termination/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

There is no evidence that osmotic cervical dilation facilitates induction using prostaglandin analogues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-induction-medication-termination/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26605275\"><span class=\"h2\">Induced fetal demise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians induce demise prior to abortion either to facilitate the abortion procedure or to prevent live birth.

Intermittent narcotic administration suffices for some patients, while others desire epidural anesthesia since this completely eliminates pain during more prolonged inductions.

Modern medication abortion began in the 1940s with the instillation of hypertonic saline or hyperosmolar urea into the amnionic sac to &quot;salt out&quot; the fetus. Use of hyperosmolar instillation was often followed by uterotonic medications to induce contractions. Induction abortion with these agents has now been largely abandoned due to risks such as hypernatremia, coagulopathy, and hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-induction-medication-termination/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. In comparison with current methods of labor induction abortion (typically with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a>), randomized trial data show that instillation abortion results in longer induction times and higher rates of both blood transfusion and retained placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-induction-medication-termination/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Oxytocin, the most commonly used induction agent at later gestational ages, fails to induce labor as effectively as other single agent therapy at midtrimester because the uterus has relatively fewer oxytocin receptors at less than 20 weeks of gestation. Oxytocin is associated with longer induction abortion intervals than newer methods, as well as higher risks of side effects such as postpartum hemorrhage and even water intoxication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-induction-medication-termination/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Patients desiring medical abortion in the second trimester now have safer, more effective options, utilizing PG agents either alone or in combination with progesterone antagonists.</p><p>Several PG agents have been used to induce abortion:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Misoprostol</a> and gemeprost, both PG E1 analogues, are the most common medications used for induction abortion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Comparative studies have found that both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> and gemeprost induce labor more effectively and with fewer side effects than other prostaglandins (eg, carboprost, sulprostone) and single agent oxytocin or oxytocin in combination with other types of prostaglandins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-induction-medication-termination/abstract/11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-15</a>]. Both misoprostol and gemeprost induce labor at a variety of gestational ages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-induction-medication-termination/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The dose decreases as pregnancy advances because the uterus becomes more sensitive to PG with decreasing dose requirements as pregnancy advances.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Misoprostol</a> is typically the preferred agent due to lower rates of certain adverse effects and complications and based on practical considerations. Gemeprost and misoprostol have been found to have similar efficacy in randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-induction-medication-termination/abstract/17-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-21</a>]. As an example, in one trial of 81 women between 12 to 25 weeks of gestation, pregnancy termination with misoprostol (200 mcg every 12 hours) compared with gemeprost (1 mg every 3 hours) resulted in a significantly higher rate of complete abortion (61 versus 32 percent), but a longer induction-to-abortion interval (27.8 versus 14.5 hours). The mean blood loss was significantly lower in the misoprostol group. Women treated with misoprostol had fewer adverse effects (eg, nausea, vomiting).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The advantages of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> in comparison with gemeprost are: reduced need for narcotic analgesia, less frequent need for surgical evacuation of the uterus, has more routes of administration, is less expensive, and does not require refrigeration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-induction-medication-termination/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carboprost, a PG F2alpha analogue, results in more systemic side effects than PG E analogues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-induction-medication-termination/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sulprostone, a PG E2 analogue, has fallen out of favor because it has been associated with myocardial infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-induction-medication-termination/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2215691\"><span class=\"h2\">Route and regimen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The route of administration, dose, and dosing interval of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> vary across protocols. There are limited high quality data to establish the optimal protocol. In general, misoprostol administered by the buccal route has been found to have higher bioavailability than oral, and with fewer adverse effects. Sublingual administration has similar efficacy to vaginal dosing. However, for first trimester medication abortion, many experts advise avoiding vaginal administration due to concerns regarding infection. A systematic review of randomized trials found that the vaginal route was preferable although, among multiparous women, sublingual administration appeared equally effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-induction-medication-termination/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. A subsequent randomized trial found that vaginal or sublingual dosing were associated with a shorter time to pregnancy completion than oral dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-induction-medication-termination/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>General principles of the dose, route of administration, and timing of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=first-trimester-medication-abortion-termination-of-pregnancy#H16674296\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;First-trimester medication abortion (termination of pregnancy)&quot;, section on 'Misoprostol'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-as-a-single-agent-for-medical-termination-of-pregnancy#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Misoprostol as a single agent for medical termination of pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Data on drug administration'</a>.)</p><p>For the second trimester, the dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> ranges from 200 to 800 mcg. In regimens using misoprostol or gemeprost alone, median induction-to-abortion intervals are approximately 12 to 16 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-induction-medication-termination/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The abortion time interval is decreased with more frequent dosing. Two randomized trials demonstrated a significantly shorter induction time with vaginal administration of misoprostol 400 mcg every three hours compared with every six hours, without a significant increase in side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-induction-medication-termination/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2215715\"><span class=\"h3\">Use of mifepristone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Mifepristone</a> may be used in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> to decrease the induction-to-abortion interval and minimize pain. Mifepristone is an antiprogestin that competitively blocks both progesterone and glucocorticoid receptors. By opposing the activity of progesterone, mifepristone elicits a variety of effects that make the uterus more susceptible to abortion. These effects include cervical dilation, decidual necrosis, increased endogenous prostaglandin production, and increasing uterine sensitivity to exogenously administered prostaglandin. Mifepristone administration gradually elicits a five-fold increase in sensitivity to prostaglandin 24 to 48 hours after its administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-induction-medication-termination/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The synergy between mifepristone and prostaglandin permits greater efficacy of prostaglandin at lower doses, potentially minimizing side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-induction-medication-termination/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>The improved efficacy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a> was best illustrated in a randomized trial that compared second-trimester abortion with intraamniotic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> (buccal 400 mcg, then 200 mcg every six hours) preceded by either mifepristone (oral 200 mg) or placebo (oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-c-ascorbic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin C</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-induction-medication-termination/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Women in the mifepristone group had a significantly shorter median procedure time (10 versus 18 hours). In addition, the mifepristone group had a nonsignificant association with lower rates of retained placenta (3.1 versus 6.3 percent) and analgesic requirements (27.2 versus 39.3 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a>).

Women failing to deliver the fetus after five doses of misoprostol, if otherwise clinically stable, may stop the abortion process for 12 to 24 hours before resuming the induction cycle.

A systematic review of 15 randomized trials conducted in China evaluated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a> combined with the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> versus intra-amniotic injection of ethacridine lactate and found that <span class=\"nowrap\">mifepristone/misoprostol</span> has lower failures rates (2 to 6 percent versus 7 to 21 percent; risk ratio 0.37, 95% CI 0.17-0.80) and shorter time of labor (an average of 1.9 hours shorter). More gastrointestinal side effects occurred in the <span class=\"nowrap\">mifepristone/misoprostol</span> group, but cervical injury was more frequent in the ethacridine lactate group. &#160;<strong> </strong></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8857874\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOME AND COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Second-trimester surgical abortion is a safe and effective procedure. Most terminations are completed as inductions, but some women require a surgical procedure for a retained placenta. In addition to retained products of conception, potential complications include uterine rupture, cervical laceration, hemorrhage, and infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26605106\"><span class=\"h2\">Incomplete abortion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Incomplete abortion is more common in second-trimester induction abortion than in surgical abortion (1 to 7 versus 0 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-induction-medication-termination/abstract/32,40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,40,41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8857880\"><span class=\"h2\">Retained placenta</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In induction procedures with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a>, 2 to 10 percent of women have a retained placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-induction-medication-termination/abstract/24,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,42,43</a>]. Induction protocols that include misoprostol inductions less commonly require surgical intervention for delivery of the placenta than induction with other agents, though rates of retained placenta are higher for all medical methods compared with dilation and evacuation (D&amp;E) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-induction-medication-termination/abstract/40,41,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41,44</a>].</p><p>Traditionally, in an induction abortion, clinicians have performed curettage if the placenta remained undelivered 30 to 120 minutes following delivery of the fetus. This is based upon reports regarding a technique that is now used infrequently, hyperosmolar saline and prostaglandin E2, which was associated with higher rates of complications with an increasing interval from the delivery of the fetus to the placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-induction-medication-termination/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. With <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> inductions, some data suggest that waiting for up to four hours is acceptable. As an example, in one retrospective study of 233 women who underwent second-trimester induction with misoprostol, 59 percent of placentas delivered within one hour of fetal expulsion. The overall rate of surgical intervention for retained placenta was 6 percent and 11 of 14 surgical procedures were performed to expedite hospital discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-induction-medication-termination/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. An interval of four or more hours for the delivery of the placenta was not associated with increased morbidity.</p><p>In our practice, for hemodynamically stable patients, we manage delivery of the placenta expectantly for four hours after delivery of the fetus before intervening to remove the placenta.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8857886\"><span class=\"h2\">Uterine rupture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uterine rupture can occur in women with a scarred or unscarred uterus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-induction-medication-termination/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In a systematic review of second-trimester abortion with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a>, the risk of uterine rupture among women with prior cesarean delivery was 0.28 percent, whereas the risk in women without prior cesarean was 0.04 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-induction-medication-termination/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The Society for Family Planning (SFP) in the United States supports second-trimester induction abortion in women with prior cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-induction-medication-termination/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. No studies have evaluated the safety of medical abortion among women with uterine scarring secondary to prior myomectomy or surgery for correction of M&uuml;llerian uterine anomalies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8857892\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical laceration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical laceration may occur in either induction or surgical abortion.

Although clinicians often treat postabortal atony similar to postpartum atony, the second-trimester uterus has fewer oxytocin receptors, limiting response to high-dose oxytocin. Carboprost 250 mcg intramuscularly every 15 minutes up to eight doses and low-dose cervical vasopressin have both been described in the setting of postabortal hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-induction-medication-termination/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Balloon tamponade with intrauterine balloon catheters, uterine compression sutures, and angiographic embolization might become necessary in more severe cases of hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-induction-medication-termination/abstract/52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-54</a>].

One advantage of this approach compared with surgical abortion is that it results in an intact fetus, which may be preferable for a patient in certain circumstances. (See <a href=\"#H8856878\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prophylactic antibiotics are not typically advised for second-trimester medication abortion. (See <a href=\"#H4801490\" class=\"local\">'Prophylactic antibiotics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osmotic dilators do not facilitate second-trimester medical abortion. Some clinicians use osmotic dilators if there is a high likelihood of conversion of the procedure to a surgical uterine evacuation. (See <a href=\"#H8857850\" class=\"local\">'Cervical preparation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feticidal injections are often given to prevent live birth. Another potential goal of induced fetal demise is to facilitate labor induction. (See <a href=\"#H26605275\" class=\"local\">'Induced fetal demise'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women undergoing induction termination can receive analgesia or anesthesia similar to that used for obstetric labor induction. Intermittent narcotic administration suffices for some patients, while others desire epidural anesthesia. (See <a href=\"#H8857856\" class=\"local\">'Anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Current protocols for second-trimester induction abortion typically include a prostaglandin, usually <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a>, and may utilize <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a> or oxytocin. Prior protocols that used hypertonic saline have been largely abandoned due to risks such as hypernatremia, coagulopathy, and hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"#H8857868\" class=\"local\">'Protocol'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women undergoing second-trimester induction abortion, we suggest use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> combined with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a> rather than misoprostol alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).
