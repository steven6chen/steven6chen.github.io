A complete assessment will examine multiple components, including the physical ability to chew and swallow food; evaluation for food intolerances; ability to digest and absorb foods; evaluation of possible eating disorders and appetite fluctuations; unintentional weight loss or gain; taste changes; and the skills and ability to comply with dietary lifestyle changes (shopping, cooking, and understanding of the dietary plan).</p><p>Although complex patients may be referred to a dietitian for such an assessment, other patients can be adequately assessed in a primary care setting. This can be expected to take 5 to 15 minutes. This topic will discuss methods to assess a patient's diet and related behaviors in the primary care setting.</p><p>Specific dietary and nutritional counseling recommendations will depend on the patient's comorbidities and are discussed in the appropriate topics.

This determines which dietary lifestyle changes are reasonable for a given patient and any existing beneficial dietary habits that should be encouraged.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86188279\"><span class=\"h2\">Estimating portion sizes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians should be aware that many patients have difficulties with accurately reporting portion sizes, particularly for foods that are horizontally estimated (eg, spaghetti or rice on a plate) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-assessment-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Most patients underreport portion sizes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-assessment-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. When asking about portion sizes, using comparisons can be helpful (a deck of cards [3 ounces]; 1 cup of broccoli is about the size of a fist; 1 cup of ice cream is about the size of a tennis or racquetball) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F56956\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56956 \">figure 1</a>). Note that the patient goal is not necessarily to be accurate with what is a portion; rather, it is to eat more or less of that particular food.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86188355\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment options</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depending on the time available, dietary habits can be assessed quickly with a few questions, or more formally with a 24-hour dietary recall (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F50919\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef50919 \">form 1</a>), <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/pdf/food_diary_cdc.pdf&amp;token=mjmpv7xMHRIW2nr+3NCnseCrvgGLU1goqby3Zk1U6Z9INxIutguG6SAhCbjO0m0Fzx/Bu0vdMtaLGLfhnWOoiA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=5366\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">food diary</a>, or food frequency questionnaire (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F69381\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69381 \">table 1</a>). Various online tracking applications and tools are available to facilitate these assessments. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Assessment tools'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Quick approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Simply asking patients, &quot;What can you do to improve your diet?&quot; can reduce time spent in assessment by highlighting areas the patient is willing to consider changing. Patients often can inform the clinician of the areas of weakness in their diet and which behaviors contribute to body weight or other adverse health risks (such as elevated blood sugars).</p><p>It is important to identify strengths in the diet (fruit, vegetables, other healthy options) to build on positive dietary foundations. The clinician may then follow up in subsequent visits to assess patient changes, which is important for patient motivation and accountability.</p><p>Simple advice can improve a patient's diet. A recommendation of increasing fiber or lowering saturated fat, by providing specific food examples, can also have a beneficial impact on other areas of the diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-assessment-in-adults/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Patients who consume sweetened beverages (eg, soda, sugary waters, juice, sweetened iced tea, coffee, and sports drinks) can improve their diets by decreasing consumption of these beverages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-assessment-in-adults/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Also, intake of trans-fatty acids often comes from packaged and processed foods with hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils (eg, dry mixes, creamers, frozen or boxed foods, and baked goods such as cakes, cookies, crackers, pies and breads) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-assessment-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Eliminating consumption of these products can add up to large changes over time. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=healthy-diet-in-adults#H26714245\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Healthy diet in adults&quot;, section on 'Sweetened beverages'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dietary-fat\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dietary fat&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">24-hour dietary recall</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A dietary assessment tool commonly used is the 24-hour dietary recall. The goal of the 24-hour dietary recall is to identify the day-to-day pattern of eating with a minimum of reporting bias. Most people have little variability in their dietary patterns and are remarkably consistent with caloric intake and food choices. The clinician will ask what the patient consumed in the last 24 hours, including beverages, and, if time permits, may also ask about the portion sizes of the foods. To save time, the clinician may focus on the evening meal and snacks consumed before bedtime. This is often the area of concern and changes from this alone can make a beneficial difference. (See <a href=\"#H86188279\" class=\"local\">'Estimating portion sizes'</a> above.)</p><p>The methodology of the 24-hour dietary recall is to query the previous day's intake, separating meal occurrences: &quot;What is the first thing you had to eat or drink yesterday?&quot;; &quot;Did you have anything else at the time?&quot;; &quot;What was the next thing you had to eat or drink?&quot; Continue asking questions with a timeframe, including snacks before bedtime and any night eating. Ask the time the patient went to bed, so as to calculate when <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> ate <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> last meal (helpful when assessing gastroesophageal reflux disease [GERD], irritable bowel syndrome [IBS], etc). Ask about <em>where</em> foods are eaten (eg, home, work, restaurants). This exercise can also elicit behaviors and lifestyle factors that underlie dietary choices. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Behavioral assessment'</a> below.)</p><p>Remember that patients frequently fail to report beverage and alcohol consumption and most patients will require regular prompting such as, &quot;What did you have to drink with that?&quot; Patients should also be asked about frequency and quantity of alcohol consumption.</p><p>Ask about combined foods, such as cream in coffee and butter on bread. As in other settings, we avoid leading questions. For example, ask if the patient had anything on or with the bread, rather than if he had butter on the bread.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5709936\"><span class=\"h3\">Food diary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another option for dietary assessment is to ask the patient to bring in a three- or four-day <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/pdf/food_diary_cdc.pdf&amp;token=mjmpv7xMHRIW2nr+3NCnseCrvgGLU1goqby3Zk1U6Z9INxIutguG6SAhCbjO0m0Fzx/Bu0vdMtaLGLfhnWOoiA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=5366\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">food diary</a> that contains a complete record of foods and beverages consumed over those days. This transfers much of the time burden from the clinician to the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-assessment-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Then, highlight foods that need to be changed in addition to any beneficial choices that should be continued.</p><p>The diary itself can be an excellent tool to help patients increase awareness of their eating habits and to encourage compliance with recommended dietary changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-assessment-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Patients will alter what they consume, and increase their awareness of intake because they are asked to write it down.</p><p>Additional questions may be needed to clarify the patient's diet around areas of concern (ie, sodium, carbohydrate, fiber). A food frequency questionnaire is useful in this setting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Food frequency questionnaire</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An abbreviated assessment may be performed by obtaining only the frequency of typical foods that are consumed in the patient diet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F69381\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69381 \">table 1</a>). This is especially useful in identifying healthy foods which can be grouped but is not as useful in identifying unhealthy and processed foods which are ubiquitous in every food category. The food frequency questionnaire will cover typical intake over a period of time (usually one month).</p><p>Focus on one or more key areas that are correlated with your patient's health concerns. Ask how often the patient consumes the food and then probe for greater detail. For example, if the patient has a high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level, you may want to explore sources of saturated fat and hydrogenated fats (trans-fats), such as meats, cheese, processed foods, snacks, and dairy products. For this same patient, it may also be appropriate to identify sources of soluble fiber which may be missing from the patient's diet (oats, barley, legumes, nuts, seeds, fruit, and vegetables).</p><p>Many patients are overfed in calories but lacking in healthy foods. What is missing in the diet is equally important to what may be in excess. Food frequency assessments can reveal that a patient is not eating a variety of fruit, vegetables, whole grains, and fish. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=healthy-diet-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Healthy diet in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment tools</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are multiple assessment tools available to facilitate a dietary assessment, including forms, websites, and online or smart phone applications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86188036\"><span class=\"h3\">Forms</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The following form can be used to obtain dietary information from the patient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F50919\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef50919 \">form 1</a>).

Behavioral and life factors will impact the patient's ability to implement dietary change and can be assessed by asking about prior attempts at dietary change. Patients should be asked about their dietary environment, which includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Work and other time constraints, including weekend differences.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Access and financial ability to buy healthy foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-assessment-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Timing of intake &ndash; Does the patient go for hours without eating and then increase intake in the evening?

For example, if a patient has limited access to healthy foods at home, a patient can try shopping at a different grocery store <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> keeping healthy foods in sight at home. Other suggestions include bringing lunch to work or, when eating out, eating only half of the portion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> substituting a vegetable for a starch.</p><p>Lifestyle changes, including diet and physical activity, are best accomplished with support from friends and family. When possible, all family members should follow the same diet. Change is likely to take place incrementally, building upon increasing knowledge about the impact of diet upon health concerns, and with skills developed to meet those concerns in a tasty and flavorful way.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2250373235\"><span class=\"h1\">REFERRAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with complex dietary concerns such as those with diabetes, renal disease, digestive disorders, cancer, and morbid obesity should be referred to a registered dietitian for comprehensive assessment.
