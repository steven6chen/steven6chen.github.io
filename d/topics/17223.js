This type of infection is caused by a fungus called &quot;candida.&quot; Candida is a type of fungus called &quot;yeast,&quot; so some people call thrush a yeast infection of the mouth and throat. The same kind of yeast can cause diaper rash in babies or vaginal infections in women.</p><p>Anyone can get thrush. But it is more common in:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older adults</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People taking antibiotics</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People being treated for cancer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People with HIV</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13396082\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of thrush?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people with thrush have no symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>White patches lining the cheeks, on the tongue, or on back of the throat (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F56812\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56812 \">picture 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Redness inside the mouth without white patches. (This happens in people who wear dentures.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cotton-mouth, which is when you feel like your mouth is filled with cotton</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13396089\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see my doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you have symptoms of thrush, call your doctor or nurse for an appointment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13396096\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for thrush?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, but most people do not need it. Your doctor or nurse should be able to diagnose thrush just by looking inside your mouth. To confirm, he or she might also run a Q-tip (called a &quot;swab&quot;) along your tongue or cheek and collect some fluid. Then he or she can send the fluid to the lab and have it checked for yeast.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13396103\"><span class=\"h1\">How is thrush treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with thrush usually get a prescription mouth rinse or a lozenge that has medicine to kill the yeast. (A lozenge is like a candy that you suck on.) There is also a tablet that sticks to your gums. If these options do not work, people sometimes take a pill that has medicine to kill yeast. People who have severe infections or other health problems sometimes get the pill right away.</p><p>People who wear dentures must also clean their dentures really well every night.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13396110\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I prevent thrush?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most people, doctors and nurses do not give medicines to prevent thrush. The best way to prevent thrush is by keeping your mouth clean. If you wear dentures, it is really important to clean them every night and to give your mouth some time without the dentures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13396207\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mouth-and-dental-injuries-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Mouth and dental injuries in children (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
