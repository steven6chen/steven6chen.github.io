These reactions may be caused by the insulin itself or by additives within the preparation. Hypersensitivity reactions to insulin are rare with human insulins and insulin analogues. However, some types are serious and even life-threatening and may have a significant detrimental impact on the patient's diabetic management. Evaluation requires close collaboration with endocrinology and allergy experts.</p><p>The clinical manifestations, classification, diagnosis, and management of hypersensitivity reactions to insulin preparations are discussed in this topic review. Other adverse effects of insulin therapy are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of insulin therapy in diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Safety'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29781079\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypersensitivity to insulin can occur in all age groups and in patients with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes.</p><p>Hypersensitivity reactions to the human insulins and insulin analogues used today are rare, although comprehensive epidemiologic studies are lacking. Estimates of incidence range from 0.1 to 3 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. In contrast, insulin hypersensitivity was more common when relatively impure and heterologous porcine and bovine insulins were widely used, as these are far more immunogenic. The progressive improvement in purification of nonhuman insulins, use of single animal species insulins, and the nearly universal adoption of highly purified human insulins beginning in the 1980s, all contributed to the reduction in injection site and systemic allergic reactions to insulin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24822813\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL APPROACH TO THE PATIENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When first approaching a patient with possible insulin hypersensitivity, the history should focus on the rapidity with which the signs and symptoms develop after injection (ie, within minutes to one hour versus later) to distinguish immediate from delayed reactions, the presence or absence of systemic symptoms to judge the severity, and whether the reactions have become worse over time. If signs and symptoms are limited to the skin, the injection site and the rest of the integument should be carefully examined. In most cases, skin changes that are suspected to be a manifestation of insulin hypersensitivity have other causes, such as injection site irritation or a separate dermatologic condition, such as prurigo nodularis simplex subacuta or atopic dermatitis. (See <a href=\"#H24822819\" class=\"local\">'Injection site irritation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H700571265\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H700569895\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Important questions in the evaluation of possible hypersensitivity reaction to insulin include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the specific symptoms following insulin injections?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How quickly do the symptoms develop with respect to each injection? Immediate reactions begin within one hour of injection. Delayed reactions start later than one hour after injection, and in most cases, they start several hours to one day or two later.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are the symptoms localized to the injection site or do they affect more distant parts of the body? This should help in distinguishing local from systemic reactions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are the symptoms the same after each injection or are they variable and changing over time? If the patient initially had local reactions and now is having systemic symptoms, the possibility of impending anaphylaxis should be considered and evaluation should be expedited.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do the symptoms sometimes occur unrelated to insulin injections? Do reactions occur only when the patient also takes a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)? If the patient answers affirmatively, disorders such as chronic urticaria or angioedema should be considered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Which insulins were used in the past and how well were they tolerated? If any other insulin preparations were used in the past, the additives and types of insulins should be compared. However, the clinician should be mindful that in patients who have developed a new allergy to an insulin or additive, the fact that a preparation containing that same component was tolerated in the past does not exclude the possibility that the patient has become reactive to it since.</p><p/><p>If other dermatologic conditions can be excluded, the clinician should attempt to categorize the reaction. (See <a href=\"#H25138030\" class=\"local\">'Types of hypersensitivity reactions'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24822819\"><span class=\"h1\">INJECTION SITE IRRITATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, localized symptoms at injection sites are mild in severity and can be managed by optimizing injection technique and other simple measures. Most of these reactions are caused by irritation, rather than representing a hypersensitivity reaction. It may be informative to observe the patient's injection technique. The following can be helpful:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discontinue routine use of isopropyl alcohol swabs or other irritating cleansing solutions at injection sites.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Change injection sites regularly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make sure to inject deeply enough.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not inject where a belt buckle or waistband rubs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cool the site briefly before injecting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Try smaller needles.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Massage the injection site for a few moments after injection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inject in a calm environment.</p><p/><p>If these measures do not result in improvement, then further evaluation is appropriate.</p><p>Proper insulin injection techniques are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of insulin therapy in diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Injection technique'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=using-insulin-the-basics#H1667080455\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: Using insulin (The Basics)&quot;, section on 'How do I give myself an insulin shot?'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25138030\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypersensitivity reactions to insulin preparations may be divided into &quot;immediate&quot; and &quot;delayed&quot; based upon how quickly signs and symptoms develop. However, it is not always possible to make this distinction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H815357\"><span class=\"h2\">Immediate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immediate hypersensitivity reactions to insulin (or an additive in the insulin preparation) generally develop within one hour after an injection. These range in presentation from local reactions that consist of rapidly developing erythema or a pruritic wheal at the injection site to systemic reactions that may involve generalized urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, or hypotension and anaphylaxis. Immediate anaphylactic reactions are rare, but should be evaluated promptly. An allergy evaluation should be urgently arranged, and the patient may need to be monitored in the hospital if insulin is absolutely required, so that a safe insulin can be identified. (See <a href=\"#H269028198\" class=\"local\">'When to refer'</a> below and <a href=\"#H23592110\" class=\"local\">'Immediate reactions'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H815364\"><span class=\"h2\">Delayed</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Delayed reactions develop later than one hour and typically between 6 and 24 hours. Common presentations include eczematous skin changes or induration or nodules at the sites of injection. Delayed hypersensitivity reactions can be evaluated on a nonurgent basis if they persist. (See <a href=\"#H700570247\" class=\"local\">'Delayed reactions'</a> below.)</p><p>In the remainder of this topic, delayed and immediate reactions are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H23592110\" class=\"local\">'Immediate reactions'</a> below and <a href=\"#H700570247\" class=\"local\">'Delayed reactions'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23592110\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMEDIATE REACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immediate hypersensitivity reactions to insulin generally present within one hour after an injection, although the symptoms often appear much more rapidly (sometimes within seconds) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These reactions may be caused by insulins or by additives in the insulin, such as protamine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25138046\"><span class=\"h2\">Signs and symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immediate reactions range from local skin reactions to systemic reactions. The severity of immediate reactions can also vary somewhat from injection to injection.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Local immediate reactions</strong> &ndash; Local skin reactions present as rapidly developing pruritic erythema or wheal at the injection site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Systemic immediate reactions</strong> &ndash; Systemic reactions may present with generalized urticaria, pruritus (especially of the palms and soles), and angioedema, although a wide range of symptoms are possible (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F58836\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58836 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Sometimes other injection sites will react (ie, become erythematous) simultaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Cases of severe anaphylaxis are reported, some of which were fatal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. Nausea, diarrhea, confusion, tremor, blurry vision, and diplopia have been reported with anaphylaxis to insulin, although these signs and symptoms are not typical of drug-induced anaphylaxis.</p><p/><p>The onset of allergic symptoms is typically months to years after beginning injection therapy with a specific insulin preparation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, there are case reports of immediate reactions developing upon the patient's first few injections or in response to an insulin to which the patient had no known previous exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/12,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14,15</a>]. In these unusual cases, it is possible that the culprit antigen is a determinant that is also present in endogenous insulin or another insulin preparation to which the patient had been previously exposed.</p><p>Sometimes local symptoms increase in intensity over time (days to weeks), ultimately culminating in systemic reactions. This phenomenon has also been described with allergic reactions to other allergens, in which symptoms are initially limited to the skin but then evolve to affect the respiratory <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> gastrointestinal tract, eventually resulting in full anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9506622\"><span class=\"h3\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immediate reactions to insulin preparations are believed to be immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated, type I immunologic reactions to insulin or to an additive (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80466\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80466 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F91420\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91420 \">table 3</a>). In type I drug allergy, sensitization to the antigen (drug) develops in susceptible individuals prior to the initial allergic reaction. Sensitization refers to the formation of drug-specific IgE molecules and binding of these molecules to high affinity IgE receptors on mast cells and basophils. However, patients treated with human insulin may develop insulin-specific IgE antibodies within the first few months of therapy without allergic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Once sensitization has occurred, re-exposure to the drug can lead to cross-linking of IgE on the surface of mast cells and basophils and subsequent release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine specifically induces vasodilatation, an increase in vessel permeability, and pruritus. In the case of insulin, it is not known if interruptions in therapy increase the risk of immediate reactions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-allergy-pathogenesis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug allergy: Pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Type I (IgE-mediated)'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H269028198\"><span class=\"h2\">When to refer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immediate intervention and evaluation is necessary if a patient has signs or symptoms suggestive of anaphylaxis, and ongoing insulin therapy is essential. Such patients should be urgently referred to an allergy or dermatology expert with experience in drug allergy. Most immediate reactions are less severe than anaphylaxis and evolve over time. Patients with less severe immediate reactions should also be referred in a timely manner. Also, if a patient's skin changes cannot be categorized, the patient should be evaluated by a dermatologist, because a biopsy of the site may be helpful. (See <a href=\"#H25138046\" class=\"local\">'Signs and symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9506068\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial management of immediate reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial interventions in the patient with immediate reactions to insulin preparations include discontinuing insulin therapy (which is only an option in some patients with type 2 diabetes), symptomatic treatment, consultation of an allergist, and empirically changing insulin preparations. Of note, patients who have experienced anaphylaxis should be admitted to the hospital urgently for multidisciplinary management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9506191\"><span class=\"h3\">Symptomatic treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with immediate reactions, symptomatic therapy may provide some relief. The following may be helpful in patients with localized immediate reactions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral antihistamines can be helpful for patients with urticaria or angioedema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Drugs and doses are similar to those used for chronic urticaria, which are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-urticaria-standard-management-and-patient-education#H3658100086\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic urticaria: Standard management and patient education&quot;, section on 'Stepwise approach to treatment'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In some cases, systemic glucocorticoids might be necessary for patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">urticaria/angioedema,</span> until the diagnosis is made and a management plan is determined. However, systemic glucocorticoids elevate blood sugars further and complicate management.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9506197\"><span class=\"h3\">Empirically change insulin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients who require continuation of insulin therapy, the clinician can choose a different insulin preparation or an insulin analogue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. Insulin analogues are options for patients allergic to human insulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], although if the patient has signs or symptoms of a severe systemic immediate allergic reaction (ie, anaphylaxis), it is important to consider the additives contained in the different preparations, as these are often used in both human insulin and analogues. Analogues have been implicated in immediate hypersensitivity reactions as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].

The antigenic epitope may be a nonself epitope, an altered self-epitope, or an epitope generated by alternate protein folding that can occur during production or purification of insulin preparations. In theory, the degradation of insulin in the subcutaneous depot (for example by proteases) could expose other epitopes. In most cases, the antigenic epitope is thought to be a determinant unique to recombinant proteins, which have different tertiary structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], or a determinant on one of the nonprotein components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25137720\"><span class=\"h4\">Protamine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=protamine-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Protamine sulfate</a> is a protein isolated from fish sperm that can be complexed to insulin to delay absorption. Protamine is added to most long-acting (ie, up to 24 hours) insulin preparations, and it has been implicated in immediate allergic reactions in patients with diabetes, as well as in anaphylaxis during reversal of heparin in cardiovascular procedures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F91420\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91420 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/11,27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,27-29</a>]. Previous exposure to protamine is a risk factor for having protamine allergy. In contrast, fish allergy and prior vasectomy have been proposed as risk factors for protamine allergy, but one prospective study found no evidence for these associations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The pathogenesis of immediate reactions to protamine is not established, and both IgE-mediated and complement-mediated mechanisms have been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Thus, immediate-type skin testing has been successfully used to identify protamine-sensitive patients in some but not all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=protamine-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Protamine sulfate</a> for injection (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL)</span> may be diluted 30-fold to 333 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/mL</span> for <strong>prick</strong> skin testing, which is similar to the concentration in undiluted NPH insulin (350 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/mL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. For <strong>intraderma</strong>l testing, the testing solution should be diluted further. Initial concentrations for intradermal testing are generally 10- or 100-fold more dilute than prick testing solutions, and further dilutions are warranted for patients with anaphylaxis. One patient with anaphylaxis had a positive intradermal test to 0.03 <span class=\"nowrap\">nanograms/mL</span> of protamine, so extreme sensitivity is possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H341737301\"><span class=\"h4\">Other additives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cresol compounds are preservatives present in most insulin preparations that should be considered in immediate reactions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F91420\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91420 \">table 3</a>).

Insulins are applied undiluted for prick testing. If the initial readings of the prick tests are negative, then intradermal (intracutaneous) testing is performed next, using insulin solutions that are diluted in saline 1:100 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Most insulins are commercially available in a 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/mL</span> solution; a 1:100 dilution is equivalent to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/mL</span>.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prick tests are read after 15 minutes.

Results are measured after 15 minutes. A diameter of the wheal of &ge;3 mm is considered as a positive reaction.</p><p/><p><strong>Late readings of skin test sites</strong> &ndash; A second reading of the skin testing sites after 24 hours is referred to as a &quot;late reading.&quot; The presence of induration is considered a positive result, and the site is then examined again at 48 hours. Note that this delayed reading of prick or intradermal testing is not standard protocol in the evaluation of immediate-type drug allergies. However, the author and others have found this type of testing to be useful in identifying some forms of delayed insulin reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/5,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,33</a>]. In addition, sometimes it is not clear from the patient's history or examination whether a local reaction is delayed or immediate, and in this situation, it is prudent to evaluate for both possibilities with skin testing.</p><p><strong>False-positive results</strong> &ndash; Note that immediate-type skin testing must be interpreted in the context of the patient's clinical history, because false-positive skin prick tests have been documented to both human insulin and protamine in diabetic subjects without any allergic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/10,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,33</a>]. Because immediate insulin hypersensitivity is so rare with recombinant human insulins, it is difficult to collect enough patients to perform studies of the sensitivity and specificity of skin testing. A small study of seven patients newly treated with human insulin found that positive prick test results and low insulin-specific IgE titers developed in nearly one-third of subjects, although none had symptoms of hypersensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3795305692\"><span class=\"h4\">Skin testing to protamine and other additives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Commercial kits containing various insulin preparations and insulin additives for use in skin testing were available in some European countries in the past, although production has been discontinued in most.

The causative allergen can be avoided by choosing a different preparation suitable for the patient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F91420\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91420 \">table 3</a>). If no alternative preparation can be identified or the patient does not experience adequate control of blood sugars using alternative insulins, desensitization to the desired insulin can be performed. Case reports have described the use of anti-IgE therapy, pancreatic transplant, and immunosuppressants in complicated cases.

Desensitization is also associated with a decrease in insulin-specific IgE titers and possibly an increase in immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>Most published insulin desensitization protocols consist of series of gradually increasing subcutaneous doses, although there are also reports of successful protocols using continuous subcutaneous infusion delivered through insulin pumps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/40,44-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,44-48</a>].

The clinician should ensure that the patient is injecting deep enough into the subcutaneous layers of the skin. Local eczematous reactions can be treated with a topical corticosteroid-containing (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mometasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mometasone</a>) ointment. Pruritus may respond to local application of a polidocanol-containing urea cream (commercially available in Europe, Asia, and Australia, but not in the United States). Oral antihistamines are also helpful for pruritus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H700570335\"><span class=\"h2\">Referral</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diabetologists have experience in managing local insulin reactions, and many local reactions will spontaneously subside over the course of several weeks. If the reactions do not improve after a couple of months, referral to an allergy or dermatology expert is appropriate to try to identify the cause of the reaction, as evaluation usually requires skin testing (patch testing) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> skin biopsy. Once a cause is identified (eg, allergen-inducing contact dermatitis), an insulin preparation lacking this agent should be substituted, if possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H700570341\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms and evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At least two distinct types of delayed reactions have been described. Induration and subcutaneous nodules are mostly linked to type III reactions (immune complex-mediated reactions), whereas eczematous skin changes or exanthema are mostly type IV reactions. If the patient's reaction has any features of an immediate reaction or is difficult to characterize, then <span class=\"nowrap\">prick/intracutaneous</span> testing with late readings should be performed first.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Induration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> subcutaneous nodules</strong> &ndash; Induration at the injection site can be present in delayed reactions. This can manifest sometimes as subcutaneous nodules, which may or may not be pruritic or painful. Evaluation involves one or more of the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Biopsy of the affected skin is helpful in the evaluation of subcutaneous nodules to help characterize the nature of the cellular infiltrate and determine if vasculitis is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis responsive to systemic glucocorticoids was identified in one case [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Biopsy can also exclude other causes of subcutaneous induration or nodules. Granulomatous reactions have also been described and attributed to immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies directed against insulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. These IgG antibodies form immune complexes with insulin that precipitate in the tissues. These reactions may represent a localized Arthus reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. This antibody binding (usually to low titer antibodies) might affect the kinetics of insulin action.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Laboratory tests provide additional information, although they are not necessary for the diagnosis. Anti-insulin immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibodies have been reported to be elevated in patients with local hypersensitivity reactions compared with controls. However, it should be noted that anti-insulin IgG antibodies are commonly found in insulin-treated patients and are not necessarily associated with clinical symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. Lymphocyte transformation tests, where available, can help assess the T cell response to specific drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Erythematous or eczematous skin changes or exanthema</strong> &ndash; Local reactions can also present as eczematous skin changes at the injection site. Pruritus or a burning sensation is reported by some patients. With this presentation, it is important first to make sure that the patient does not have other dermatologic conditions, such as atopic dermatitis. (See <a href=\"#H700571265\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some patients may additionally experience systemic symptoms, including maculopapular exanthema, headache, nausea, or diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These changes have been attributed to delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions involving predominantly T cells (type IVc) or eosinophils (type IVb) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These systemic symptoms have been attributed to additives within the insulin preparations, such as cresol (or metacresol), protamine, and zinc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/3,5,18,38,66-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,18,38,66-68</a>].

Cresol reactions have been demonstrated with patch testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. One report used a solution of medium containing 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> metacresol and glycerol in a Finn chamber for patch testing and tested glycerol alone in parallel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patch-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patch testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Materials from the catheter pump and application devices can also cause such hypersensitivity reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/71-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">71-76</a>]. Specifically, diabetic patients have developed contact dermatitis to acrylates in the plastic catheters of infusion sets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/71,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,74</a>] and in the &quot;butterfly&quot; glue (Loctite) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Other reports mentioned additional potential contact allergens in insulin, including parabens, phenol, nickel, and isophane, but specific cases of hypersensitivity to these agents in insulin were not cited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

These reactions may be caused by the insulin itself or by additives within the preparation and can occur in all age groups and in patients with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. (See <a href=\"#H29781079\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial clinical history should focus on the rapidity with which the signs and symptoms develop after injection to distinguish immediate from delayed reactions and on the presence or absence of systemic symptoms. In most cases, skin changes that are suspected to be a manifestation of insulin hypersensitivity have other causes, such as injection site irritation or a separate dermatologic condition. (See <a href=\"#H24822813\" class=\"local\">'Initial approach to the patient'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypersensitivity reactions are categorized as immediate or delayed. Immediate reactions generally develop within one hour after an injection and often much more quickly. These rare reactions range from local erythema or a pruritic wheal at the injection site to systemic anaphylaxis that may involve generalized urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, or hypotension. Delayed reactions develop later than one hour and typically between 6 and 24 hours. Common presentations include eczematous skin changes or induration or nodules at the sites of injection. Delayed reactions usually resolve spontaneously with time. (See <a href=\"#H25138030\" class=\"local\">'Types of hypersensitivity reactions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Immediate reactions</strong> to insulin preparations typically begin months to years after starting injection therapy with a specific insulin preparation. They are believed to be immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated, type I immunologic reactions to insulin or to an additive, such as protamine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80466\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80466 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F91420\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91420 \">table 3</a>). They may be localized or systemic or may start as local reactions that progress over time to become generalized. (See <a href=\"#H23592110\" class=\"local\">'Immediate reactions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Initial interventions in the patient with immediate reactions to insulin preparations include discontinuing insulin therapy (which is only an option for some patients with type 2 diabetes), symptomatic treatment with antihistamines (if the reaction is mild and localized), empirically changing insulin preparations, and consultation with an allergist. However, patients who have experienced anaphylaxis and require insulin should be admitted to the hospital urgently for multidisciplinary management. (See <a href=\"#H9506068\" class=\"local\">'Initial management of immediate reactions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The diagnosis of an immediate hypersensitivity reaction to insulin is based upon a suggestive clinical history, the demonstration of immediate sensitization to insulin (using skin <span class=\"nowrap\">prick/intracutaneous</span> testing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> IgE immunoassays) or additive (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F89388\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef89388 \">form 1</a>), and exclusion of other causes of the symptoms. Referral to an allergy expert is indicated. An evaluation for immediate hypersensitivity should be performed if the patient's reaction has any features of an immediate reaction. (See <a href=\"#H12033032\" class=\"local\">'Allergy evaluation of immediate reactions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H453386071\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis of immediate reactions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If an immediate allergy is confirmed to a specific insulin or additive, the allergy should be documented and explained to the patient. The causative allergen can be avoided by choosing a different preparation in some cases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F91420\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91420 \">table 3</a>). If no alternative preparation can be identified or the patient does not achieve adequate control of blood sugars using alternative insulins, desensitization to the desired insulin can be performed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F88752\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88752 \">table 5</a>). Case reports have described the use of anti-IgE therapy, pancreatic transplant, and immunosuppressants in complicated cases. (See <a href=\"#H25138360\" class=\"local\">'Management of confirmed immediate insulin allergy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Delayed reactions</strong> at the site of insulin injection are usually transient, resolving spontaneously within a few weeks. Initial measures are intended to minimize symptoms and include topical therapies or oral antihistamines. If the reactions do not improve after a couple of months, referral to an allergy or dermatology expert is appropriate to try to identify the cause of the reaction, as evaluation usually requires skin testing (patch testing) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> skin biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H700570247\" class=\"local\">'Delayed reactions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of immediate hypersensitivity to insulin preparations includes acute or chronic urticaria. The differential diagnosis of delayed insulin hypersensitivity includes prurigo nodularis simplex subacuta, exacerbation of atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, or other contact allergies. (See <a href=\"#H700571265\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-insulins/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Fern&aacute;ndez L, Duque S, Montalb&aacute;n C, Bartolom&eacute; B.
