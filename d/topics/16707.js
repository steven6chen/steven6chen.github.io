It is classically characterized by four clinical features, but the first two are used diagnostically because the last two may not be seen in all patients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nephrotic range proteinuria &minus; Urine protein excretion &gt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypoalbuminemia &minus; Serum albumin &lt;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (30 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Edema</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperlipidemia</p><p/><p>Idiopathic NS is the most common form of NS in children, representing more than 90 percent of cases before 10 years of age and 50 percent after 10 years of age. The majority of children with NS will respond to steroid therapy. However, symptomatic treatment is important in the early course of therapy, as response to steroid therapy may take several weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptomatic-management-of-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Symptomatic treatment also becomes the mainstay of therapy in children who fail to respond to steroids, especially in those with genetic mutations that cause their NS.</p><p>The symptomatic management of nephrotic syndrome in children will be reviewed here. Specific treatment of nephrotic syndrome in children is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-idiopathic-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3533431109\"><span class=\"h1\">HYPOVOLEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite a total increase in body water, children with NS typically have a decreased intravascular volume. Clinical signs and symptoms may be present in patients with significant intravascular volume depletion including tachycardia, findings of peripheral vasoconstriction (eg, cool extremities and delay in capillary refill), oliguria, and abdominal pain. A very low fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) less than 0.2 percent is suggestive of volume depletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptomatic-management-of-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In this situation, an albumin infusion can be safely administered if clinically required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EDEMA</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Salt restriction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Edema is treated by salt restriction because renal retention of sodium is one of two principal mechanisms that lead to edema in the NS. In an already edematous patient, salt restriction alone will not significantly improve edema, but can reduce further accumulation of fluid. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-treatment-of-edema-in-patients-with-the-nephrotic-syndrome#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and treatment of edema in patients with the nephrotic syndrome&quot;, section on 'Evidence supporting primary renal sodium retention'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Diuretics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although diuretics are commonly used in adults with NS, their role in often severely hypoalbuminemic children is less clear. Affected children may be intravascularly volume depleted and aggressive diuresis may lead to further volume depletion, thereby possibly precipitating acute renal failure and increasing the risk of thrombosis in this already susceptible group of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptomatic-management-of-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Rarely, diuretics can contribute to severe volume depletion that results in hypovolemic shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptomatic-management-of-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of nephrotic syndrome in children&quot;, section on 'Hypovolemia'</a>.)</p><p>Diuretics should only be given in cases of severe edema and only if there is not significant intravascular volume depletion. In a study of 30 children with NS and severe edema, a fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) value &lt;0.2 percent identified patients with severe edema and volume contraction who also had higher serum renin, aldosterone, and antidiuretic hormone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptomatic-management-of-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Diuretic therapy alone was used successfully in 10 of 11 patients with FENa &gt;0.2 percent. In one patient with an elevated FENa, albumin was added to diuretic therapy because of a rise in serum creatinine and the development of hyponatremia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fractional-excretion-of-sodium-urea-and-other-molecules-in-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fractional excretion of sodium, urea, and other molecules in acute kidney injury (acute renal failure)&quot;</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Furosemide</a> may be given intravenously or orally without albumin. Although it is somewhat less effective, it can be useful when given alone. Ongoing oral use of furosemide can still cause hypovolemia and hypokalemia, and close monitoring of the patient is required.</p><p>Other diuretics used in childhood NS include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thiazide diuretic &minus; Thiazide diuretics, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metolazone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">metolazone</a>, in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">furosemide</a>, appear to enhance the natriuretic and diuretic effects of furosemide alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptomatic-management-of-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, this combination of diuretics is associated with hypokalemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiloride-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Amiloride</a> &minus; Amiloride is a potassium-sparing diuretic that decreases sodium channel activity of the cortical collecting tubule. The rationale for its use is that renal sodium retention is at least in part related to an activation of the epithelial sodium channel, which is abolished by amiloride [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptomatic-management-of-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. It can be used in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">furosemide</a> to decrease the risk of hypokalemia.</p><p/><p>Because of the potential for serious complications, diuretic management should be supervised by a nephrologist who has expertise in treating children with NS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H339346562\"><span class=\"h3\">Furosemide and albumin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with anasarca (generalized and massive edema) may be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">furosemide</a> (1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per dose) in combination with salt-poor albumin (0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> infused over four hours). However, this treatment modality should be considered with caution due to the risk of severe complications, such as pulmonary edema, hypertension, or congestive heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptomatic-management-of-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. A careful assessment of the patient's intravascular status is necessary before prescribing an albumin infusion. Albumin and furosemide can be given to patients with evidence of intravascular hypovolemia (ie, FENa &lt;2 percent), whereas patients who have normal or increased intravascular volume should be treated with diuretics alone (FENa &gt;2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptomatic-management-of-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of nephrotic syndrome in children&quot;, section on 'Anasarca'</a>.)</p><p>Albumin raises the intravascular oncotic pressure and thereby protects the intravascular compartment against volume contraction. Albumin infusion also increases protein-binding of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">furosemide</a>, which improves the rate of delivery to the kidney resulting in increased renal salt excretion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-treatment-of-edema-in-patients-with-the-nephrotic-syndrome#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and treatment of edema in patients with the nephrotic syndrome&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p>In a retrospective study, albumin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">furosemide</a> therapy in children with NS effectively removed fluid with a mean loss of 0.4 kg (1.2 percent of body weight) per infusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptomatic-management-of-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, the effect is transient and can be associated with complications resulting from increased vascular volume, including hypertension and respiratory distress. As a result, aggressive diuresis with albumin and furosemide therapy should be reserved for patients with anasarca who have respiratory compromise due to ascites <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pleural effusions, severe scrotal edema, peritonitis, or severe tissue breakdown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptomatic-management-of-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/3,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12</a>]. Other measures, such as salt and fluid restriction, are needed to prevent reaccumulation of fluid.

In patients with hyponatremia with a serum sodium of less than 135 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> fluid restriction is required as fluid accumulation is a result of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, secondary to intravascular volume depletion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">HYPERCOAGULABILITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nephrotic patients with severe hypoalbuminemia are at risk for thromboembolic complications. Preventative measures include regular ambulation, compression stockings, avoidance of hemoconcentration resulting from hypovolemia, avoidance of central venous catheter if possible, and early treatment of sepsis or volume depletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptomatic-management-of-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

This is due in large part to the lack of randomized trials to determine the efficacy and safety of such an approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptomatic-management-of-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In some centers, prophylactic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">warfarin</a> therapy is given to high-risk patients including adolescents (&gt;12 years of age), or those with a serum albumin concentration of less than 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (20 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L),</span> a fibrinogen level of more than 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L,</span> or an antithrombin III level less than 70 percent of normal, although there is no evidence that it is beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptomatic-management-of-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15</a>].

Antifactor Xa assay is used for therapeutic drug monitoring. In situations where short half-life and reversible anticoagulation is necessary, unfractionated heparin is utilized. The heparin dose necessary to obtain a therapeutic effect is often greater than normal due to decreased antithrombin III level. Thrombolysis is reserved only for severe cases with life- or limb-threatening thromboembolism. In patients with previous thromboembolic complications, we will start treatment anticoagulation therapy if the patient remains nephrotic, which places them at continued risk for thrombosis.

In addition, hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. As a result, antihypertensive therapy is given to children with CKD, including those with nephrotic syndrome, to reduce blood pressure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63856\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63856 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52646\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52646 \">table 2</a>).

However, symptomatic management is important in the early course of therapy, as response to steroid therapy may take several weeks, and it is the mainstay of therapy in children who fail to respond to steroids. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-idiopathic-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Symptomatic management includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with significant signs or symptoms of decreased intravascular volume, we suggest albumin infusion may be used to restore intravascular volume (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with persistent proteinuria, salt and fluid restriction, and diuretics (alone or in combination with salt-pore albumin) are used to control edema.
