These include the effects of HBV on maternal and fetal health, the effects of pregnancy on the course of HBV infection, treatment of HBV during pregnancy, and prevention of mother-to-child transmission. </p><p>Prevention of mother-to-child transmission is an important component of global efforts to reduce the burden of chronic HBV since vertical transmission is responsible for approximately one-half of chronic infections worldwide. The risk of developing chronic HBV infection is inversely proportional to the age at time of exposure. The risk is as high as 90 percent in those exposed at birth without vaccination, while the risk is much lower (about 20 to 30 percent) in those exposed during childhood. Maternal screening programs and universal vaccination of infants have significantly reduced transmission rates. </p><p>This topic will review special considerations for the management of patients with acute and chronic HBV infection during pregnancy and the postpartum period, as well as prevention of mother-to-child transmission.

Other causes include liver diseases associated with pregnancy, such as acute fatty liver of pregnancy, HELLP syndrome, and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-liver-disease-occurring-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to liver disease occurring during pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-fatty-liver-of-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute fatty liver of pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hellp-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HELLP syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection during pregnancy is usually mild and not associated with increased mortality or teratogenicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-and-pregnancy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Thus, infection during gestation should not prompt consideration of termination of the pregnancy. However, there have been reports of an increased incidence of low birth weight and prematurity in infants born to mothers with acute HBV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-and-pregnancy/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. </p><p>Acute HBV occurring early in the pregnancy has been associated with a 10 percent perinatal transmission rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-and-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Transmission rates significantly increase if acute infection occurs at or near the time of delivery, with rates as high as 60 percent reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-and-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Thus, serial monitoring should be performed throughout pregnancy, and if the mother remains hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive or has detectable serum HBV DNA, the infant should receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-immune-globulin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hepatitis B immune globulin</a> in addition to the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine at birth. Antiviral therapy to reduce maternal viral load should also be considered if the mother has high serum HBV DNA levels near the time of delivery. (See <a href=\"#H50247993\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of mother-to-child transmission'</a> below.) </p><p>Treatment of acute infection is mainly supportive. Liver biochemical tests and prothrombin time should be monitored. Antiviral therapy is usually unnecessary, except in women who have acute liver failure or protracted severe hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-and-pregnancy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-overview-of-management#H2621326403\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus: Overview of management&quot;, section on 'Acute infection'</a>.)</p><p>For those with acute HBV infection who require antiviral therapy, the choice of which agent to use should be based upon the predicted duration of treatment, and the accessibility and cost for the patient. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate</a> (TDF) (300 mg daily) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> (100 mg daily) are both suitable options in this setting because both have been safely used during pregnancy, and the risk of developing resistance is low since the duration of treatment is expected to be short [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-and-pregnancy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, we prefer TDF as there is less risk of resistance. A more detailed discussion of the safety of antiviral agents for the treatment of HBV during pregnancy is found below. (See <a href=\"#H231281766\" class=\"local\">'Safety of antiviral agents in pregnancy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H182092753\"><span class=\"h1\">CHRONIC HEPATITIS B VIRUS INFECTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2652237504\"><span class=\"h2\">Impact of pregnancy on the natural history of chronic HBV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnancy is generally well tolerated in women with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection who do not have advanced liver disease. However, pregnancy is considered to be an immune tolerant state and is associated with high levels of adrenal corticosteroids that may modulate immune response. Thus, the following clinical manifestations may be seen in pregnant women with chronic HBV:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hepatic flares</strong> &ndash; The immunological changes during pregnancy and the postpartum period have been associated with hepatitis flares (including hepatic decompensation). A flare of HBV infection is typically defined as a greater than two- to threefold rise in the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) that is at least three to five times above the reference range. However, flares with serious clinical sequelae appear to be uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-and-pregnancy/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. In a prospective study that followed 126 women during pregnancy and the postpartum period, 2 patients developed a flare during pregnancy whereas 27 (25 percent) developed a flare in the postpartum period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-and-pregnancy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. During the postpartum period, flares may be related to immune reconstitution, a situation immunologically analogous to flares that have been described following the withdrawal of corticosteroids in nonpregnant patients with chronic HBV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-and-pregnancy/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-reactivation-associated-with-immunosuppressive-therapy#H1731276934\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus reactivation associated with immunosuppressive therapy&quot;, section on 'HBV flare'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Predictors of HBV flares during pregnancy have not been established. However, flares appear to be more common in women who are hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-and-pregnancy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In addition, flares have been associated with HBeAg seroconversion in approximately 12 to 17 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-and-pregnancy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], a rate similar to what has been described in patients who are not pregnant. Limited evidence suggests that seroconversion is unrelated to maternal age, parity, or the presence of precore or basal core promotor mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-and-pregnancy/abstract/8,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and natural history of hepatitis B virus infection&quot;, section on 'HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Progression of liver disease</strong> &ndash; The immunologic, metabolic, and hemodynamic changes that occur during pregnancy have the potential to worsen or unmask underlying liver disease. Although progression to cirrhosis is not expected within such a short time for most patients, decompensation can occur in the setting of a severe flare.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, it can be difficult to assess the progression of liver disease during pregnancy because of normal physiologic changes that can mimic clinical features of chronic liver disease. In particular, serum albumin and hematocrit often decrease, while alkaline phosphatase and alpha fetoprotein increase. Similarly, physical examination may reveal findings suggestive of stigmata of chronic liver disease such as palmar erythema, lower extremity edema, and spider angiomata.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>HBV DNA</strong> &ndash; The immunologic changes associated with pregnancy also have the potential to increase HBV viremia; however, most studies have found that HBV DNA levels remain stable during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-and-pregnancy/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H779530320\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect of chronic HBV on pregnancy outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For mothers with chronic HBV, the impact of HBV infection on newborns is not well defined and data are conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-and-pregnancy/abstract/14-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-21</a>]. As an example, one large study compared 824 hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive women with 6281 HBsAg-negative controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-and-pregnancy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. No differences were seen in gestational age at delivery, birth weight, incidence of prematurity, neonatal jaundice, congenital anomalies, or perinatal mortality. However, other studies have found possible associations between chronic HBV and gestational diabetes mellitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-and-pregnancy/abstract/14,15,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15,19</a>], increased risk of prematurity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-and-pregnancy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], lower birth weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-and-pregnancy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], and antepartum hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-and-pregnancy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>Women with cirrhosis are at significant risk for perinatal complications and poor maternal and fetal outcomes, including intrauterine growth restriction, intrauterine infection, premature delivery, and intrauterine fetal demise. The increased risk was demonstrated in a population-based study in Canada, which compared maternal and fetal outcomes in 399 patients with cirrhosis to a matched control group who delivered between 1993 and 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-and-pregnancy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Maternal complications including gestational hypertension, placental abruption, and peripartum hemorrhage were increased in the group with cirrhosis. In addition, 15 percent of mothers with cirrhosis developed hepatic decompensation. Overall mortality was significantly higher than controls (1.8 versus 0 percent). Infants born to mothers with cirrhosis also had higher rates of prematurity and growth restriction and significantly higher rates of fetal mortality (5.2 versus 2.1 percent). Other reports have described an increased risk of variceal bleeding, particularly during the third trimester and during labor because of increased intra-abdominal pressure and plasma volume expansion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-in-women-with-pre-existing-chronic-liver-disease#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy in women with pre-existing chronic liver disease&quot;, section on 'Cirrhosis and portal hypertension in pregnancy'</a>.)</p><p>A discussion of mother-to-child transmission is found below.

The health of the mother and fetus must be considered independently when deciding on treatment. Pregnant women with chronic HBV should be managed in conjunction with a hepatologist. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3801167499\"><span class=\"h3\">Women who are pregnant</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some women with chronic HBV require antiviral therapy to prevent progression of liver disease (eg, those with immune-active hepatitis), while others can be observed.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patients who become pregnant while receiving antiviral therapy </strong>&ndash; Women should inform their clinician immediately if they become pregnant while receiving antiviral therapy, and the risks and benefits of continuing treatment should be discussed. Continuing treatment may pose a risk to the fetus while discontinuing treatment may pose a risk of hepatitis flare for the mother. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Discontinuing treatment can be considered in women without cirrhosis if the patient has achieved a therapeutic endpoint (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-overview-of-management#H34\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus: Overview of management&quot;, section on 'Duration and treatment endpoints'</a>). Otherwise, women receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=entecavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">entecavir</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adefovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adefovir</a>, interferon, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenofovir-alafenamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tenofovir alafenamide</a> (a formulation of tenofovir that was approved in 2016) can continue treatment by switching to an alternative agent, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tenofovir disoproxil fumarate</a> (TDF), which has more safety data available, and appears to be safe for use in pregnancy. These women should be monitored closely during the transition period to ensure viral suppression. A more detailed discussion of the safety of antiviral agents during pregnancy is found below. (See <a href=\"#H231281766\" class=\"local\">'Safety of antiviral agents in pregnancy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Indications for antiviral therapy </strong>&ndash; The decision to initiate therapy while pregnant depends upon the presence or absence of cirrhosis, HBeAg, and hepatitis B e antibody (anti-HBe), as well as the HBV DNA and aminotransferase levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-and-pregnancy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-overview-of-management#H3458586686\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus: Overview of management&quot;, section on 'Indications for antiviral therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-overview-of-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus: Overview of management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The indications for antiviral therapy in pregnant women are generally the same as those for patients who are not pregnant. Antiviral therapy is recommended for patients with a persistently elevated ALT &gt;2 times the upper limit of normal and an elevated HBV DNA (HBV DNA &gt;20,000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> in HBeAg-positive patients or HBV DNA &ge;2000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> in HBeAg-negative patients) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F58520\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58520 \">table 1</a>). However, in pregnant women without cirrhosis, some scenarios may differ. As examples:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A woman may choose to defer therapy until after delivery if she has evidence of mild disease activity, such as aminotransferase levels just above the treatment threshold. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>By contrast, a woman with a viral load &gt;2 x 10<sup>5 </sup>international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> should initiate therapy in the third trimester even if the aminotransferase levels are normal. In this setting, the goal of therapy is to prevent transmission to the child. (See <a href=\"#H603338278\" class=\"local\">'Maternal antiviral therapy to prevent transmission'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">TDF is preferred if antiviral therapy is contemplated in pregnant women because of its potency, safety profile, and low risk of resistance. (See <a href=\"#H231281766\" class=\"local\">'Safety of antiviral agents in pregnancy'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-overview-of-management#H2130204242\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus: Overview of management&quot;, section on 'Overview of antiviral agents'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Monitoring women without indications for antiviral therapy</strong> &ndash; Women who are not on antiviral therapy during pregnancy should be monitored closely to evaluate for a flare (see <a href=\"#H2652237504\" class=\"local\">'Impact of pregnancy on the natural history of chronic HBV'</a> above): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We obtain liver biochemical tests every three months during pregnancy and for up to six months postpartum. Thereafter, monitoring will be the same as for other hepatitis B patients not requiring antiviral therapy, generally every six months for HBeAg-positive patients in the immune tolerant phase and every 6 to 12 months for those who are confirmed to be in the inactive carrier phase (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F60627\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60627 \">table 2</a>).

In addition, the HBV DNA should be measured at 26 to 28 weeks to determine if antiviral therapy should be offered to reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission. (See <a href=\"#H603338278\" class=\"local\">'Maternal antiviral therapy to prevent transmission'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Women with cirrhosis</strong> &ndash; The management of cirrhosis in a pregnant woman does not differ from that of non-pregnant patients. Variceal screening with endoscopy is still recommended and is safe during pregnancy. Active variceal bleeding should be managed the same way with banding. Indications for use of beta blockade for prophylactic or post-variceal bleeding management is the same as in nonpregnant individuals, but the use of beta blockers is associated with a small increase in risk of intrauterine growth restriction, <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/neonatal</span> bradycardia, neonatal hypoglycemia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neonatal respiratory depression. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Octreotide</a> should not be given during management of acute variceal bleeding because of the risk of uterine ischemia.

They are determined by the HBeAg status, the HBV DNA level, and the activity or stage of liver disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-overview-of-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus: Overview of management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, there are important considerations in women of child-bearing potential:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those with mild liver disease who are planning to conceive in the near future may choose to defer treatment and be observed until they have completed childbearing. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those who elect to undergo treatment before attempting pregnancy may opt for pegylated interferon because of its finite duration (48 weeks), provided they use contraception during treatment. However, if the patient chooses treatment with a nucleos(t)ide analogue, TDF is preferred; limited experience supports its safety in pregnancy, and the risk of drug resistance is low. (See <a href=\"#H231281766\" class=\"local\">'Safety of antiviral agents in pregnancy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who become pregnant while on therapy should contact their provider immediately. The management of such patients is described above. (See <a href=\"#H3801167499\" class=\"local\">'Women who are pregnant'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H143474097\"><span class=\"h3\">Breastfeeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants who received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-immune-globulin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hepatitis B immune globulin</a> (HBIG) and the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine at birth can be breastfed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-and-pregnancy/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. However, it is important that the infant complete the hepatitis B vaccine series. Mothers with chronic hepatitis B who are breastfeeding should also exercise care to prevent bleeding from cracked nipples. Carrier mothers should not participate in donating breast milk. Discussions of breastfeeding and HBV transmission and newborn immunization are found below. (See <a href=\"#H50248214\" class=\"local\">'Breastfeeding and transmission'</a> below and <a href=\"#H28184739\" class=\"local\">'Newborn immunization'</a> below.)</p><p>For women with chronic HBV who continue antiviral treatment after delivery, the safety data on the use of HBV antiviral therapy during breastfeeding is unclear. Thus, the benefits of breastfeeding, and the availability of alternatives to breastfeeding, should be discussed with women who require postpartum antiviral therapy. The decision to breastfeed should be based upon patient preference. </p><p>Drug labels have typically recommended that nucleos(t)ide analogues be avoided during breastfeeding because they are excreted into the breastmilk. However only low levels of tenofovir are detected among women receiving TDF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-and-pregnancy/abstract/26-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-30</a>], and these are unlikely to have any biologic effects on the nursing infant. As an example, one study found that the median breastmilk dose from mothers receiving TDF represented 0.03 percent of the proposed oral infant dose, and simulated neonatal plasma concentrations were extremely low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-and-pregnancy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In addition, case reports of infants born to mothers with chronic HBV found no short-term adverse effects in infants who were breastfed while their mothers received TDF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-and-pregnancy/abstract/31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-34</a>]. </p><p>Data from HIV-infected women also support the safety of antiviral therapy during breastfeeding.

Approximately 10 percent of patients in each group were lost to follow-up; however, similar results were obtained if last available infection status was imputed or analysis was performed with missing data imputed as infected. </p><p>Although TDF did not demonstrate a clear benefit in this trial, these findings do not alter our approach to maternal antiviral therapy since the generalizability is limited. As an example, the adherence to the protocol for infant immunoprophylaxis in this trial may be not be replicable in other settings. HBIG and birth-dose vaccine are not available in many countries despite recommendations from the World Health Organization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-and-pregnancy/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Even in countries with birth-dose HBV vaccination programs, such as the United States, the recommended timing of HBV vaccine is within 12 hours of birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-and-pregnancy/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>], and only 71.1 percent of infants receive birth-dose HBV vaccine by three days of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-and-pregnancy/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. In addition, infants in this study received four doses of HBV vaccine before assessment for HBV infection at six months, whereas most guidelines recommend only two to three doses before six months (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76345\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76345 \">table 3A</a>). The results of this study do not refute the current recommendation to administer antiviral therapy to highly viremic mothers, but suggest that further investigation of post-exposure immunization regimens may be warranted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28184739\"><span class=\"h3\">Newborn immunization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Newborns of mothers who test positive for HBsAg should receive passive-active immunization, with the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine series and one dose of HBIG administered within 12 hours of delivery at different sites (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76345%7EPEDS%2F55139\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76345 graphicRef55139 \">table 3A-B</a>).

These include the effects of HBV on maternal and fetal health, the effects of pregnancy on the course of HBV infection, treatment of HBV during pregnancy, and prevention of mother-to-child transmission. (See <a href=\"#H182092745\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute HBV infection during pregnancy is usually not severe and is not associated with increased mortality or teratogenicity. Treatment is mainly supportive. However, acute HBV has been associated with mother-to-child transmission. If the mother remains hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive or has a detectable HBV DNA, the infant should receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-immune-globulin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hepatitis B immune globulin</a> (HBIG) in addition to routine hepatitis B vaccination. Antiviral therapy for the mother may also be indicated to reduce the risk of transmission (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F87231\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef87231 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1333645997\" class=\"local\">'Acute Hepatitis B virus infection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H50247993\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of mother-to-child transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For mothers with chronic HBV, the impact of HBV infection on newborns is not well defined and data are conflicting. However, women with cirrhosis are at significant risk for perinatal complications and poor maternal and fetal outcomes, including intrauterine growth restriction, intrauterine infection, premature delivery, and intrauterine fetal demise. (See <a href=\"#H779530320\" class=\"local\">'Effect of chronic HBV on pregnancy outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy is generally well tolerated by women with chronic HBV who do not have advanced liver disease. However, HBsAg-positive mothers should be monitored closely during pregnancy and the postpartum period, since such women are at risk of developing a hepatitis flare. (See <a href=\"#H2652237504\" class=\"local\">'Impact of pregnancy on the natural history of chronic HBV'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Various factors need to be assessed when determining the management of pregnant women with chronic HBV during pregnancy, including the indications for treatment, the anticipated duration of therapy, the potential adverse effects to the fetus, and the risk of developing drug resistance. (See <a href=\"#H50248265\" class=\"local\">'Management considerations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants who received HBIG and the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine at birth can be breastfed. It is important that such infants complete the course of vaccination. If antiviral therapy is continued after delivery, low levels of tenofovir are detected in maternal breastmilk, which are unlikely to have any biological effects on the nursing infant. However, data are limited and the decision to breastfeed should be based upon patient preference. (See <a href=\"#H50248214\" class=\"local\">'Breastfeeding and transmission'</a> above and <a href=\"#H143474097\" class=\"local\">'Breastfeeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The infection rate among infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers who do not receive any form of neonatal prophylaxis is as high as 90 percent. However, administering HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine to infants at delivery can reduce transmission by at least 95 percent. The most important risk factors for transmission, despite prophylaxis, appear to be a positive hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) in the mother and a high maternal HBV viral load. (See <a href=\"#H4119544777\" class=\"local\">'Risk of transmission'</a> above and <a href=\"#H143473919\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors for transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testing for HBsAg should be performed on all women at the first prenatal visit and repeated late in pregnancy in those at high risk for HBV infection. Newborns of HBsAg-positive mothers should receive passive-active immunization (HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine) within 12 hours of delivery and then complete the hepatitis B vaccine series (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F87231\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef87231 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H603338221\" class=\"local\">'Maternal screening'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-immunization-in-infants-children-and-adolescents#H548176156\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus immunization in infants, children, and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Routine infant immunization'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to passive-active immunization of newborns, antiviral therapy for the mother may reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission. The importance of antiviral therapy increases with increasing viral load. For mothers not already on treatment, we test HBV DNA level at 26 to 28 weeks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F87231\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef87231 \">algorithm 1</a>). For pregnant women with an HBV viral load &gt;2 x 10<sup>5</sup> international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> (&gt;10<sup>6</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL),</span> we recommend antiviral therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). We initiate antiviral therapy at 28 to 30 weeks gestation. We prefer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tenofovir disoproxil fumarate</a> since it appears safe in pregnancy, and the risk of drug resistance is low. Patients should be monitored for a flare if antiviral therapy is discontinued after delivery.
