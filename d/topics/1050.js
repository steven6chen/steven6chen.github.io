The primary goal of antibiotic stewardship is to optimize clinical outcomes while minimizing unintended consequences of antibiotic use (including toxicity, selection of pathogenic organisms such as <em>Clostridium difficile</em>, and the emergence of antibiotic resistance) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-outpatient-settings/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Additional benefits include improving susceptibility rates to targeted antibiotics and optimizing resource utilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-outpatient-settings/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The majority of antibiotic use occurs in outpatient settings, making this a critical target of antimicrobial stewardship. In the United States in 2011, more than 260 million courses of antibiotics were prescribed in the outpatient setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-outpatient-settings/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Infections of the respiratory tract, skin and skin structure, and urinary tract are the most frequent diagnoses for which antibiotics are prescribed in the outpatient setting.</p><p>Issues related to outpatient antibiotic stewardship are reviewed here. General principles regarding antibiotic stewardship and issues related to antibiotic stewardship in hospital settings are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimicrobial-stewardship-in-hospital-settings\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimicrobial stewardship in hospital settings&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H355466139\"><span class=\"h1\">BACKGROUND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inappropriate antibiotic use in outpatient settings is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-outpatient-settings/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. In one study of adult outpatient visits in the United States in 2010 to 2011, approximately 13 percent of visits resulted in an antimicrobial prescription; at least 30 percent of these were inappropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-outpatient-settings/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Another study including more than 1000 adults with respiratory tract infection seen in outpatient clinics between 2009 and 2011 noted that 77 percent were prescribed antibiotic therapy; antibiotic therapy was inappropriate in 64 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-outpatient-settings/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The approach to antibiotic prescribing in United States outpatient settings is highly variable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-outpatient-settings/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In one study of a pediatric primary care network, the probability of being prescribed a non&ndash;first-line antimicrobial for community-acquired pneumonia ranged from 0.22 to 0.88 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-outpatient-settings/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In a review of outpatient visits for acute respiratory infection (ARI), the 10 percent of providers who prescribed antibiotics most frequently did so for 95 percent of ARI visits, while the 10 percent of providers who prescribed the least frequently did so for &lt;40 percent of ARI visits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-outpatient-settings/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Increasingly, antimicrobial stewardship is being included in oversight by regulatory bodies' oversight. Effective in 2017, the Joint Commission requires that all hospitals and nursing care centers have antimicrobial stewardship programs; this regulation also applies to all outpatient facilities associated with the hospital or center, including clinics and ambulatory surgical centers.</p><p>In addition, implementation of the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) includes incorporation of data regarding treatment of infections into quality measures; this has a major potential impact on physician reimbursement. Under MACRA, physicians may earn a payment adjustment based on evidence-based and practice-specific quality data. The program includes measures specifically tied to antibiotic stewardship; antibiotic use for each healthcare facility funded by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is compared with a benchmark established by facilities with comparable patient population and census. In addition, development of an antibiotic stewardship program is included as a potential MACRA improvement activity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2216849565\"><span class=\"h1\">CORE ELEMENTS OF OUTPATIENT STEWARDSHIP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Core elements of outpatient antibiotic stewardship (outlined by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-outpatient-settings/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Commitment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Action for policy and practice (stewardship program interventions)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tracking and reporting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Education and expertise</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1483812464\"><span class=\"h2\">Commitment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians can commit to antibiotic stewardship by displaying a public statement in patient care areas describing adherence to appropriate antibiotic use; this approach also provides an opportunity to educate patients about the issue.

In one survey performed by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 54 percent of providers believed their patients expected to receive antibiotics during visits for a cough or cold, while only 26 percent of patients actually had such an expectation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-outpatient-settings/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Communication training, including shared decision-making, can help prescribers avoid unnecessary antimicrobial prescribing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-outpatient-settings/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. As an example, it may be beneficial for clinicians to provide education regarding adverse effects of antimicrobials as well as to offer guidance regarding alternative forms of symptomatic relief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-outpatient-settings/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Establish standards for antibiotic prescribing; this might include implementation of national guidelines <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> developing facility-specific guidelines (if applicable) to establish clear expectations for appropriate antibiotic prescribing.

One survey of primary care physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants noted that providers frequently fail to comply with guidelines even when they are familiar with them [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-outpatient-settings/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Reasons included belief that non-recommended antibiotics were more effective, concern for complications, and patient satisfaction; concern about the general problem of antibiotic resistance was not routinely factored into decisions about antibiotic use.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use watchful waiting or delayed prescribing for patients with conditions that usually resolve without treatment but who can benefit from antibiotics if symptoms do not improve; this approach can safely decrease antibiotic use when used in accordance with clinical practice guidelines. In such cases, symptomatic relief should be provided with a clear plan for follow-up if symptoms worsen or do not improve (for example, the patient may be instructed to call or return for a prescription, or a postdated prescription may be provided with instructions to fill the prescription after a predetermined period).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduce inappropriate diagnostic testing that frequently leads to inappropriate antibiotic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-outpatient-settings/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].
