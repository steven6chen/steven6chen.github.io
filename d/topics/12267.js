A mathematical model predicted 16 gray (Gy) of radiation would deplete the ovarian oocyte pool at age 20 years and 10 Gy of radiation would deplete the ovarian oocyte pool at age 45 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-transposition-before-pelvic-radiation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. One method of protecting the ovaries from radiation injury is to transpose them out of the radiation field (ie, ovarian transposition, also known as ovarian suspension, oophoropexy, or ovariopexy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-transposition-before-pelvic-radiation/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. The vascular pedicle remains intact in ovarian transposition, which distinguishes this procedure from ovarian transplantation.</p><p>Historically, the ovaries were relocated medially by suturing them to the posterior uterus, and protected during radiation therapy with a lead shield placed centrally on the abdomen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-transposition-before-pelvic-radiation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, medially placed ovaries still absorb radiation from scatter and some transmission through the shield, reducing the efficacy of the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-transposition-before-pelvic-radiation/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. In one report of medial ovarian transposition by positioning the ovaries behind the uterus in 11 girls with Hodgkin lymphoma, the authors reported 14 pregnancies approximately 15 years later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-transposition-before-pelvic-radiation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Contemporary procedures transpose the ovaries above the pelvic brim and as lateral as possible, which minimizes the ovarian dose of radiation and improves efficacy compared with medial approaches. Various lateral locations have been used, including the base of the round ligament [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-transposition-before-pelvic-radiation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], the level of lower kidney pole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-transposition-before-pelvic-radiation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], and the paracolic gutters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-transposition-before-pelvic-radiation/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. </p><p>Related topics are discussed in detail separately, including: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pelvic radiation and toxicity (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-related-toxicity-from-the-use-of-radiation-therapy-for-gynecologic-malignancies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment-related toxicity from the use of radiation therapy for gynecologic malignancies&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ovarian failure following radiation therapy (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-failure-due-to-anticancer-drugs-and-radiation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovarian failure due to anticancer drugs and radiation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11178564\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ovarian transposition is performed to preserve fertility or prevent early menopause in reproductive aged women who are undergoing pelvic or low abdominal radiation therapy and who will be treated with chemotherapy with low probability of gonadotoxicity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F58142\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58142 \">table 1</a>). In our institution, the most common cancers in adults treated with low abdominal radiation are rectal and anal. These cancers are usually also treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> (FU) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitomycin</a>, which are not gonadotoxic, thus these patients are candidates for ovarian transposition. In children, Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin lymphoma, vaginal or uterine tumors, pelvic Ewing's sarcoma, and spinal tumors are more common reasons for referral for the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-transposition-before-pelvic-radiation/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. &#160;</p><p>The decision to perform ovarian transposition depends on a combination of factors including the patient&rsquo;s age, ovarian reserve, desire for future pregnancy, personal preferences (eg, willingness to take hormone therapy for premature menopause), medical condition, and prognosis. The patient&rsquo;s medical team (medical and radiation oncologists, reproductive endocrinologist, and surgeon who will perform the transposition) should help the patient weigh the risks and benefits of ovarian transposition based on her specific clinical situation.</p><p>The potential benefit of the procedure is lower in older women and women at increased risk of ovarian metastases:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Menopausal women are not candidates for ovarian transposition, as the benefits of protecting postmenopausal ovarian function are minimal. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women over 40 years old are not good candidates for transposition because they generally have reduced fertilization potential and are a high risk for ovarian failure even with the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-transposition-before-pelvic-radiation/abstract/14,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,18</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with cancers at moderate or high risk for ovarian metastasis may not be good candidates for ovarian preservation and, in turn, ovarian transposition. Cancers at high risk of ovarian metastasis include leukemia, neuroblastoma, and Burkitt lymphoma; moderate risk cancers include <span class=\"nowrap\">adenocarcinoma/adenosquamous</span> carcinoma of the cervix, squamous cell cervical cancer &gt;3 cm in diameter or &gt;stage Ib1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-transposition-before-pelvic-radiation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], colon cancer, stage IV breast cancer, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> infiltrative lobular breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-transposition-before-pelvic-radiation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30824461\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION AND COUNSELING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women whose primary objective is fertility preservation should be referred to a reproductive <span class=\"nowrap\">endocrinologist/reproductive</span> surgeon to assess ovarian reserve and discuss their options for fertility preservation. Embryo cryopreservation is the most effective method of fertility preservation; mature oocyte cryopreservation is also effective and is a good option if no sperm are available for fertilization prior to cryopreservation. These procedures can be performed in addition to, or instead of, ovarian transposition, depending on the time and resources available before the start of cancer therapy. Retrieval of immature oocytes followed by in vitro maturation and vitrification is a good method of obtaining oocytes when it is not advisable for the patient to undergo ovulation induction, but it is an investigational procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-transposition-before-pelvic-radiation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Ovarian tissue cryopreservation is another option, but it is also an investigational procedure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fertility-preservation-in-patients-undergoing-gonadotoxic-treatment-or-gonadal-resection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fertility preservation in patients undergoing gonadotoxic treatment or gonadal resection&quot;</a>.) </p><p>For women over 35 years of age and younger women with risk factors for premature ovarian failure, ovarian reserve should be evaluated. However, no test is highly reliable in predicting fertility potential. The author measures basal serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) (on cycle day 3 if possible) and anti-m&uuml;llerian hormone (AMH) levels and antral follicle count (AFC). AMH is most useful when time is limited because it can be measured anytime during the menstrual cycle. A menopausal level of FSH (&gt;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/L)</span> strongly suggests that the procedure will be futile for preserving fertility. High FSH (&gt;10 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL</span> on cycle day 3, the cut-off is highly laboratory dependent), low AMH (&lt;0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL),</span> and low AFC (4 to 10 antral follicles usually measured between days 2 and 4 of a regular menstrual cycle) indicate poor ovarian reserve, suggesting poor fertility potential. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-female-infertility#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of female infertility&quot;, section on 'Assessment of ovarian reserve'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30824468\"><span class=\"h1\">PROCEDURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Good communication is crucial among the treatment team (medical and radiation oncologists, reproductive endocrinologist, and surgeon performing the transposition). Before surgery, the radiation oncologist should outline the field of radiation on the abdominal wall so the surgeon can determine the best location of transposition.</p><p>Ovarian transposition can be performed by laparotomy or laparoscopy; outcomes are similar for both approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-transposition-before-pelvic-radiation/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. For patients who are not already undergoing laparotomy for primary treatment of their disease (eg, open radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer), laparoscopy is the preferred approach. The minimally invasive procedure has fewer complications and a shorter healing time than laparotomy, allowing earlier initiation of radiation therapy. Radiation can be started within a day or two following laparoscopy.</p><p>We retrieve immature oocytes under transvaginal ultrasound guidance, as well as at laparoscopy before ovarian transposition. In young girls, immature oocytes can only be harvested at laparoscopy.</p><p>The key steps of the procedure are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary trocar is inserted cephalad from the upper margin of the radiation field usually 2 to 3 cm above the umbilicus. This facilitates relocation of the ovaries as high as possible. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two secondary trocars are placed at the same level or slightly lower. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The abdominal cavity is thoroughly examined, including the liver and diaphragm. We perform peritoneal lavage for cytologic examination, although there is no evidence supporting its use routinely.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If oocyte retrieval is planned for oocyte or embryo cryopreservation, an oocyte retrieval needle is used to aspirate all visible follicles. If ovarian cryopreservation is planned, we perform a unilateral ovarian wedge resection or occasionally a unilateral oophorectomy. The decision is based on the patient&rsquo;s preference. Appropriate personnel and laboratory facilities must be available to process these specimens. Before processing the ovarian wedge specimen, the embryologist makes another attempt to retrieve oocytes from all visible follicles in the ovarian tissue.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The course of each ureter is identified.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ovarian ligament and vessels on each side are divided and the mesovarium on each side is opened (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F87821\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87821 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The remaining mesovarium is incised to the infundibulopelvic ligament, leaving the vascular pedicle inside the ligament intact. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ovaries are mobilized to a level cephalad to the anterior superior iliac spine without tension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-transposition-before-pelvic-radiation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. To provide sufficient mobilization, the peritoneum along the infundibulopelvic ligament is incised above the ureter and as far as the aortic bifurcation or paracolic gutter. If mobilization remains inadequate, the fallopian tubes are transected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F87822\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87822 \">picture 1</a>); however, in most cases, they can be left intact, facilitating future spontaneous conception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-transposition-before-pelvic-radiation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After ensuring that the ovarian blood supply is not kinked or compromised, the transposed ovaries are sutured securely to the peritoneum lateral to the intraabdominal or lower paracolic gutters, close to the lateral aspect of the colon near the level of the iliac fossa, using non-absorbable sutures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lateral opening in the broad ligament caudal to the newly located ovaries is closed with a few sutures to prevent herniation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical hemoclips are applied to the border of each ovary to help the radiation oncologist identify the site of the transposed ovaries.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30824475\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications of ovarian transposition are rare and include reports of injury and torsion of the ovarian blood vessels resulting in vascular ovarian injury, chronic ovarian pain, and infarction of the fallopian tube [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-transposition-before-pelvic-radiation/abstract/5,6,23,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,23,25,26</a>]. Ovarian cyst formation is described more commonly (incidence 0 to 23 percent), but may be unrelated to the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-transposition-before-pelvic-radiation/abstract/25,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4286831\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOME</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30824482\"><span class=\"h2\">Ovarian function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The purpose of ovarian transposition is to protect the ovaries from radiation and thus preserve endocrine function and fertility. Most of the data on reproductive function after ovarian transposition are based on case reports or small case series. In one review of the literature, laparoscopic ovarian transposition in women younger than 40 years was associated with preservation of ovarian function in 39 of 44 patients (88.6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-transposition-before-pelvic-radiation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p>In a series of 95 patients with cervical cancer, ovarian transposition in conjunction with radical hysterectomy was associated with preservation of ovarian function in 90 percent of patients treated by postoperative vaginal brachytherapy and 60 percent of patients treated by postoperative external radiation therapy and vaginal brachytherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-transposition-before-pelvic-radiation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Ovarian function was considered normally preserved when the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level was &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL,</span> E2 was &gt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL,</span> and when follicles were present on the ultrasound scan.</p><p>The uterus is less sensitive to radiation therapy than the ovaries, but may be affected.

When the results were analyzed by diagnosis (group 1:27 women with clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the cervix; group 2: 9 women with ovarian dysgerminoma and 1 woman with uterine sarcoma), the pregnancy rate was lower in group 1 (15 versus 80 percent). The authors hypothesized the low pregnancy rate in group 1 may be related to diethylstilbestrol-related anomalies of the reproductive tract in addition to brachytherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-transposition-before-pelvic-radiation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].
