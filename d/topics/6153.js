Little is known about the contribution of epithelial cells in clearing conidia. Relatively more is known about macrophages, which contribute to both conidial clearance and the production of secondary inflammation. These cells secrete inflammatory mediators after recognition of key cell wall components (eg, beta-D-glucan) exposed after conidial germination into hyphal forms. These mediators result in neutrophil recruitment and the activation of cellular immunity, which are important in killing potentially invasive microbial forms (hyphae) and determining the extent and nature of the immune response. Hence, risks for disease and the type of disease that occurs are the combined result of multiple cellular functions that impact proximal events in conidial clearance, production of inflammation, and killing of invasive forms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Microbial factors that impact disease potential include toxins, proteases, and secondary metabolites that exert multiple effects on the host's local pulmonary and systemic defense. These include cellular products that:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhibit phagocyte nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activation, a key component in host defense against filamentous fungi</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhibit macrophage phagocytosis and killing</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suppress functional T cell responses</p><p/><p>Histopathologically, invasive aspergillosis is characterized by progression of the infection across tissue planes. One hallmark of infection is vascular invasion with subsequent infarction and tissue necrosis. Presumably, fungal cell surface components bind to vessel wall components, including basement membrane, extracellular matrix, and cellular constituents, and can cause ischemia and infarction of structures distal to invaded arteries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIAL EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H429408\"><span class=\"h2\">Classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the past, mycologists utilized phenotypic characteristics to identify <em>Aspergillus</em> organisms to the species level; more recently, use of molecular methods has expanded the number of recognized species and increased our knowledge of the organism's pathogenicity and other characteristics.</p><p>Members of the genus <em>Aspergillus</em> are broken into multiple subgenera, each of which contains multiple sections and species.

Historically, the highest risks for invasive infections have been seen in severely immunosuppressed patients, particularly allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) or solid organ transplant (especially lung, heart-lung, and liver) recipients, and patients who experience prolonged durations of neutropenia. There are some inherited immunodeficiencies, such as chronic granulomatous disease, that lead to high risk for pulmonary aspergillosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Mannose-binding lectin deficiency has also been associated with invasive aspergillosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mannose-binding lectin deficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Data suggest that invasive aspergillosis can also occur in less immunosuppressed hosts in the intensive care unit setting, particularly those with underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) receiving glucocorticoid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. The nature of the immune suppression (the degree, duration, and type of immunodeficiency) influences the pathogenesis of disease; aspergillosis thus manifests as a spectrum of disease involving predominantly airway (eg, tracheobronchitis), lung, or both.</p><p>There are specific risk factors that are unique to patients with various underlying diseases:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In HCT recipients, risks are different early versus late after receipt of stem cells. Underlying disease, persistent neutropenia, and types of stem cells and conditioning impact risks early after transplant. Additional risk factors during the latter period include graft-versus-host disease (and accompanying therapies) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Immunologic variables that correlate with risk include impaired production of reactive oxygen species and qualitative and quantitative defects in NK and T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Various gene polymorphisms (in HCT donors, HCT and solid organ transplant recipients, or patients with hematologic malignancies) have been associated with an increased risk of invasive aspergillosis.

Patients can present with a number of signs and symptoms: fever, chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hemoptysis. The classic triad that has been described in neutropenic patients with pulmonary aspergillosis is fever, pleuritic chest pain, and hemoptysis. However, absence of this triad should not discourage consideration of this diagnosis in the patient with risk factors for disease since neutropenic patients frequently present with fever in the absence of localizing pulmonary symptoms. In such patients, lung imaging often reveals pulmonary nodules <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> infiltrates.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H429431\"><span class=\"h3\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chest radiograph is insensitive for detecting the earliest stages of pulmonary disease, but computed tomography (CT) scans typically demonstrate focal lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F56195\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56195 \">image 1</a>). The type of radiographic abnormality is variable, depending upon the host and the type of disease: bronchopneumonia, angioinvasive aspergillosis, tracheobronchitis, or chronic necrotizing aspergillosis.</p><p>Pulmonary aspergillosis typically manifests as single or multiple nodules with or without cavitation, patchy or segmental consolidation, or peribronchial infiltrates with or without tree-in-bud patterns. One relatively large review noted that small nodules (&lt;1 cm) were most common (20 of 46; 43 percent), followed by consolidation (12 of 46; 26 percent), large nodules (masses, 10 of 46; 21 percent), and peribronchial infiltrates (4 of 46; 9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Another large study that included neutropenic and nonneutropenic patients showed that the more specific signs (nodules and cavitation) were infrequent, and radiographic findings of consolidation, ground-glass infiltrates, and pleural effusions were more commonly seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Radiographic findings, as with disease manifestations, can be variable and largely depend upon the host. The radiographic progression of disease has been studied best in neutropenic patients in whom the initial findings typically include nodules that have surrounding ground-glass infiltrates (the halo sign), reflecting hemorrhage into the area surrounding the fungus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F56195\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56195 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. These nodules typically enlarge, even during appropriate therapy, and may eventually cavitate, producing the air-crescent sign [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p>However, in one study, it was noted that neutropenic patients more frequently presented with segmental areas of consolidation rather than demonstrating the classic nodule progression to cavitation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F70038\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70038 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Similar findings were reported in a cohort of solid organ transplant recipients, with the majority of patients presenting with &quot;pulmonary pneumonia&quot; (focal infiltrates, 39 percent) or &quot;pulmonary nodular&quot; (21 percent) findings on CT scan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-invasive-aspergillosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

However, the studies that evaluated this modality were small and did not evaluate patients with a heterogeneous group of underlying diseases. In addition, the risk of nephrotoxicity associated with the use of intravenous (IV) contrast has not been adequately evaluated.

Cough, weight loss, fatigue, and chest pain are common, and the chest radiograph shows a slowly progressive lesion, which can be better defined by CT scanning. However, interpretation of radiologic studies may be complicated by the presence of concomitant lung disease, since this is the setting in which chronic invasive aspergillosis usually occurs.

Tissue invasion is uncommon and occurs most frequently in the setting of immunosuppression associated with therapy for hematologic malignancies, hematopoietic cell transplantation, or solid organ transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhaled conidia are met by the innate defenses provided by resident phagocytes, specifically airway epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages. Macrophages secrete inflammatory mediators after recognition of key cell wall components (eg, beta-D-glucan) exposed after conidial germination into hyphal forms. These mediators result in neutrophil recruitment and the activation of cellular immunity, which are important in killing potentially invasive microbial forms (hyphae) and determining the extent and nature of the immune response. (See <a href=\"#H625354394\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Histopathologically, invasive aspergillosis is characterized by progression of the infection across tissue planes. One hallmark of infection is vascular invasion with subsequent infarction and tissue necrosis. (See <a href=\"#H625354394\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most invasive infections are caused by members of the <em>A. fumigatus</em> species complex. In a report of 218 infections in the United States, 67 percent were caused by members of the <em>A. fumigatus</em> complex, followed by <em>A. flavus</em> (13 percent), <em>A. niger</em> (9 percent), and <em>A. terreus</em> (7 percent). (See <a href=\"#H429415\" class=\"local\">'Species prevalence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Underlying conditions that compromise pulmonary and systemic immune responses to inhaled <em>Aspergillus</em> species serve as risk factors for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Classic risk factors for invasive aspergillosis include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Severe and prolonged neutropenia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Receipt of high doses of glucocorticoids</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Other drugs or conditions that lead to chronically impaired cellular responses (eg, immunosuppressive regimens administered to treat autoimmune diseases and to prevent organ rejection, AIDS) (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Invasive aspergillosis most commonly involves the lungs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F57220\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57220 \">picture 1</a>). Disease can present with a number of signs and symptoms: fever, chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hemoptysis. However, absence of symptoms should not discourage consideration of this diagnosis in the patient who has risk factors for disease since neutropenic patients frequently present with fever in the absence of localizing pulmonary symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary aspergillosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary aspergillosis typically manifests as single or multiple nodules with or without cavitation, patchy or segmental consolidation, or peribronchial infiltrates with or without tree-in-bud patterns. The radiographic progression of disease has been studied best in neutropenic patients in whom the initial findings typically include nodules that have surrounding ground-glass infiltrates (the halo sign), reflecting hemorrhage into the area surrounding the fungus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F56195\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56195 \">image 1</a>). These nodules typically enlarge, even during appropriate therapy, and may eventually cavitate, producing the air-crescent sign. Other fungal infections and <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> can show similar radiographic findings as invasive aspergillosis. (See <a href=\"#H429431\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above and <a href=\"#H250762355\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the presence of angioinvasive disease, <em>Aspergillus</em> spp can disseminate beyond the respiratory tract to multiple different organs, including the skin, brain, eyes, liver, and kidneys. Disseminated infection is associated with a very poor prognosis. (See <a href=\"#H58499421\" class=\"local\">'Disseminated infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other manifestations of invasive aspergillosis include tracheobronchitis, rhinosinusitis, brain abscess, endophthalmitis, endocarditis, and gastrointestinal disease. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis includes other angioinvasive fungal infections, such as mucormycosis, fusariosis, and scedosporiosis.
