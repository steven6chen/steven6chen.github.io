In some cases, however, the diagnosis is not readily apparent.</p><p>The diagnostic approach to the patient with hypokalemia will be reviewed here. There are two major components to the diagnostic evaluation: assessment of urinary potassium excretion to distinguish renal potassium losses (eg, diuretic therapy, primary aldosteronism) from other causes of hypokalemia, and assessment of acid-base status, since some causes of hypokalemia are associated with metabolic alkalosis or metabolic acidosis.</p><p>The causes, clinical manifestations, and treatment of hypokalemia are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hypokalemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hypokalemia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-hypokalemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and treatment of hypokalemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">REGULATION OF POTASSIUM EXCRETION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of the potassium filtered at the glomerulus is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule and loop of Henle, whereas most of the potassium that is excreted is derived from tubular secretion by the principal cells in the connecting tubule and cortical collecting tubule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F60693\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60693 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-patient-with-hypokalemia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Aldosterone plays a central role in this process. An increase in plasma potassium stimulates the secretion of aldosterone, which then appropriately increases potassium secretion to return the plasma potassium to normal.</p><p>The urinary response to potassium depletion is twofold:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Decreased potassium secretion by the principal cells</strong> &ndash; The effect of hypokalemia and potassium depletion on potassium secretion by the principal cells is mediated at least in part by the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-patient-with-hypokalemia/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Hypokalemia suppresses aldosterone secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-patient-with-hypokalemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], which results in reduced sodium reabsorption by principal cells. Decreased sodium reabsorption by these cells diminishes the electrogenic, lumen-negative stimulus for potassium secretion via apical potassium channels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F60693\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60693 \">figure 1</a>). In addition, potassium depletion increases renin release and systemic angiotensin II formation, which in turn downregulates apical secretory potassium channels, thereby directly inhibiting potassium secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-patient-with-hypokalemia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Increased active potassium reabsorption</strong> <strong>by type A intercalated cells</strong> &ndash; Hypokalemia activates H-K-ATPase pumps in the apical membrane of type A intercalated cells, which are adjacent to the principal cells in the cortical collecting tubules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F51361\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51361 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-patient-with-hypokalemia/abstract/2,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7,8</a>].

As examples, patients may report vomiting, diarrhea, or the use of loop or thiazide diuretics. However, the cause is occasionally uncertain. In such cases, there are two major components to the diagnostic evaluation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment of urinary potassium excretion to distinguish renal potassium losses (eg, diuretic therapy, primary aldosteronism) from other causes of hypokalemia (eg, gastrointestinal losses, transcellular potassium shifts). (See <a href=\"#H60964991\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of urinary potassium excretion'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment of acid-base status, since some causes of hypokalemia are associated with metabolic alkalosis or metabolic acidosis. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of acid-base status'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Assessment of urinary potassium excretion is best accomplished by measuring potassium excretion in a 24-hour urine collection. Excretion of more than 30 mEq of potassium per day indicates inappropriate renal potassium loss. Measurement of the potassium and creatinine concentrations in a spot urine is an alternative if collection of a 24-hour urine is impractical. A spot urine potassium-to-creatinine ratio greater than 13 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/g</span> creatinine (1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/mmol)</span> usually indicates inappropriate renal potassium loss. Causes of urinary potassium wasting are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hypokalemia-in-adults#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hypokalemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Increased urinary losses'</a>.)</p><p>After determining whether renal potassium wasting is present, assessment of acid&ndash;base status can further narrow the differential diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of acid-base status'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H60964991\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment of urinary potassium excretion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best method for assessing renal potassium excretion is a 24-hour urine collection. However, the potassium concentration or, preferably, potassium-to-creatinine ratio on a spot urine are alternatives.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6814773\"><span class=\"h3\">24-hour urine potassium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 24-hour urine collection is the most accurate method to measure urinary potassium excretion. A normal individual can, in the presence of potassium depletion that is <strong>not</strong> due to urinary losses, lower urinary potassium excretion below 25 to 30 mEq per day on a 24-hour urine collection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-patient-with-hypokalemia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Higher values suggest at least a contribution from urinary potassium wasting.</p><p>In patients with severe hypokalemia, measurement of 24-hour potassium excretion is impractical because potassium repletion is urgently needed. In such patients, a spot urine potassium may be helpful as long as the urine sodium is greater than 30 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> and the urine osmolality is greater than the plasma osmolality (suggesting that the patient is not polyuric). If the urine sodium is lower than 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the urine osmolality is lower than the plasma osmolality, then the spot urine potassium concentration may be misleading. If so, comparable information can be obtained by calculating the urine potassium-to-creatinine ratio on a single urine specimen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6814767\"><span class=\"h3\">Spot urine potassium concentration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Random measurement of the urine potassium concentration can also be used. The minimum urine potassium concentration that can be achieved with hypokalemia is 5 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-patient-with-hypokalemia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Some have suggested that extrarenal losses are present if the urine potassium concentration is less than 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-patient-with-hypokalemia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], while substantially higher values suggest at least a component of potassium wasting.</p><p>However, random measurements may be misleading since the urine potassium concentration is determined by both the amount of potassium in the urine and the urine volume. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A urine potassium concentration of less than 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> can be seen in patients with renal potassium wasting in two settings: if the cause of potassium wasting has resolved (eg, the effect of the diuretic has worn off), or if the patient is polyuric, which may be due to impaired urinary concentrating ability and, possibly, increased thirst induced by the hypokalemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypokalemia-induced-renal-dysfunction#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypokalemia-induced renal dysfunction&quot;, section on 'Impaired urinary concentrating ability'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A urine potassium concentration of 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> which seems to favor urinary potassium wasting, can also represent appropriate potassium conservation of 20 mEq per day if the urine volume is only 500 mL due to a low rate of water intake.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who are volume depleted, sodium and water delivery to the distal potassium secretory site may be substantially reduced. In this setting, the urine potassium concentration may be relatively high due to secondary hyperaldosteronism, but the urine volume and absolute amount of potassium excreted are relatively low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-patient-with-hypokalemia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Urinary sodium excretion should be above 30 to 40 mEq per day to avoid this problem.</p><p/><p>Given these limitations, measurement of the urine potassium-to-creatinine ratio is preferred because it is not influenced by the urine volume. (See <a href=\"#H60965616\" class=\"local\">'Urine potassium-to-creatinine ratio'</a> below.)</p><p>Another approach to distinguishing between extrarenal and renal causes of potassium loss is to assess the response to the administration of potassium. Patients with previous extrarenal losses (eg, diarrhea) that have ceased will respond to potassium replacement with an increase in serum potassium that will eventually return to normal. A similar response will occur with diuretic-induced hypokalemia if the diuretic has been discontinued. By contrast, potassium replacement in patients with ongoing renal potassium losses will modestly raise the serum potassium, which will be followed by an increase in urinary potassium losses to match intake, and a lesser degree of hypokalemia will persist. In addition, the serum potassium will fall back to the baseline level if potassium therapy is discontinued.

The urine potassium-to-creatinine ratio is usually less than 13 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/g</span> creatinine (1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/mmol</span> creatinine) when hypokalemia is caused by transcellular potassium shifts, gastrointestinal losses, previous use of diuretics, or poor dietary intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-patient-with-hypokalemia/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Higher values are seen with renal potassium wasting.</p><p>The efficacy of the urine potassium-to-creatinine ratio was evaluated in a study of 43 patients with severe hypokalemia (range, 1.5 to 2.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> associated with paralysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-patient-with-hypokalemia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The urine potassium-to-creatinine ratio reliably distinguished between the 30 patients with hypokalemic periodic paralysis (whose hypokalemia was caused by an internal shift of potassium from the extracellular fluid into the cells) and the 13 patients with hypokalemia due mostly to renal potassium wasting (10 had renal tubular acidosis or Gitelman syndrome). The urine potassium-to-creatinine ratio was significantly lower in the patients with periodic paralysis (11 versus 36 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/g</span> creatinine, 1.3 versus 4.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/mmol</span> creatinine). The cutoff value was approximately 22 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/g</span> creatinine (2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/mmol)</span>. In addition, patients with periodic paralysis had normal acid-base balance, while patients without periodic paralysis often had metabolic alkalosis or metabolic acidosis. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of acid-base status'</a> below.)</p><p>It is critical to distinguish hypokalemia caused by redistribution, given the risk that these patients may have rebound hyperkalemia after potassium repletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-patient-with-hypokalemia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. As an example, rebound hyperkalemia (serum potassium greater than 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> developed in 19 of the 30 patients with periodic paralysis after administration of a mean of 63 mEq of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium chloride</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-patient-with-hypokalemia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This effect is due both to reversal of the shift of extracellular potassium into the cells and to the administered potassium.
