In the first 1000 cases of AIDS reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the incidence of penile KS was 44 percent in homosexual and bisexual patients, compared with 16 percent in intravenous drug abusers and 0 percent in hemophiliac patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-pathology/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2318523063\"><span class=\"h3\">Malignant melanoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Melanomas are the most aggressive form of skin cancer and can occur anywhere on the body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109687\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef109687 \">picture 1</a>). The following skin findings are suggestive of melanoma: a dark pigmented lesion with asymmetry, irregular borders, variegated color, or a diameter &ge;6 mm, or a recent change in a lesion. Unlike penile carcinoma, these are typically flat lesions without associated tumor. However, ulceration can occur in both diseases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melanoma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H3280437029\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Melanoma: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Biopsy serves to establish the diagnosis, with subsequent definitive excision based upon location and extent. Melanomas are characterized by neoplastic melanocytes found throughout the epidermal layers. IHC is useful in difficult cases or in nodal metastases. The most widely used markers to make a diagnosis of melanoma include S-100, MART-1, and HMB-45.

SCCs represent the predominant histology, with approximately 75 percent of male urethral cancers being SCCs, while 15 to 20 percent are urothelial carcinomas, and 5 to 7 percent are adenocarcinomas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urethral-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urethral cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The most common symptom is urinary tract obstruction, which is not common in penile carcinoma. Other symptoms include hematuria (sometimes with blood dripping from the meatus), dysuria, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a purulent urethral discharge. When hematuria is present, it is more often seen on initiation rather than termination of the urinary stream. A biopsy of an intra-urethral lesion serves to establish the diagnosis and differentiate this from penile cancer, which occurs on the penile surface.</p><p>Anatomic location may be the only factor that allows one to differentiate SCC histology as originating from the penis versus the urethra.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1212077009\"><span class=\"h3\">Metastases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Metastatic disease involving the penis is rare.

The poor prognosis of patients presenting with penile metastases was demonstrated in one series of 219 patients with penile metastases, over half of whom had additional metastatic foci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-pathology/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].
