However, measurement of urinary cortisol excretion is more sensitive for the diagnosis of hypercortisolism and has largely supplanted the older assays. Evaluating daily urinary cortisol (and corticosteroid) excretion has the advantage of providing an integrated index of steroid production over a period of 24 hours, whereas measurements of serum cortisol only provide information about an instant in time. This is important because corticotropin (ACTH) and cortisol are secreted in discrete pulses, resulting in plasma concentrations that rise and fall episodically. This is true not only for normal subjects but also for some patients with Cushing's disease and a few patients with Cushing's syndrome caused by adrenal tumors or ectopic ACTH secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-urinary-excretion-of-endogenous-and-exogenous-glucocorticoids/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p>The measurement of urinary excretion of endogenous and exogenous glucocorticoids will be reviewed here. Other methods of cortisol measurement are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-cortisol-in-serum-and-saliva\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of cortisol in serum and saliva&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-in-the-laboratory-evaluation-of-adrenocortical-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles in the laboratory evaluation of adrenocortical function&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1622638\"><span class=\"h1\">URINE COLLECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The validity of the results is critically dependent upon normal renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-urinary-excretion-of-endogenous-and-exogenous-glucocorticoids/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Individuals with moderate (creatinine clearance less than 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span> and severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span> have progressively less cortisol excretion.</p><p>Additionally, over or under-collection of the 24-hour specimen can bias the results. Because of this, measurement of cortisol excretion must include concurrent measurement of creatinine excretion. The completeness of the collection (and the reproducibility of a series of collections) can be estimated from knowledge of the normal rate of creatinine excretion (which is equal to creatinine production in the steady state). In adults under the age of 50 years, daily creatinine excretion should be 20 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (177 to 221 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/kg)</span> lean body weight in men and 15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (133 to 177 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/kg)</span> lean body weight in women.</p><p>From the ages of 50 to 90 years, there is a progressive 50 percent decline in creatinine excretion (to about 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> in men), due primarily to a fall in muscle mass (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculation-of-the-creatinine-clearance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Calculation of the creatinine clearance&quot;</a>). However, the excretion of cortisol and its metabolites varies diurnally whereas creatinine excretion does not. Thus, inadequate urine collections <strong>cannot</strong> be corrected on the basis of the creatinine value. Furthermore, creatinine excretion is not affected by fluid intake, while cortisol excretion increases with increased fluid intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-urinary-excretion-of-endogenous-and-exogenous-glucocorticoids/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The importance of adequate collection should be stressed to the patient.

The development of UFC assays in the 1970s represented a major advance over measuring urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids (17-OHCS), which measures both cortisol and its urinary metabolites. Serum cortisol measures both cortisol bound to corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) and free hormone, while UFC measures only non-CBG bound cortisol (which is filtered by the kidney unchanged).<em> </em>Therefore, UFC is unaffected by medications and medical conditions that affect CBG, such as oral estrogen use, which increases CBG and serum cortisol concentrations, while UFC is unchanged.</p><p>The use of the 24-hour UFC test in the diagnostic evaluation of Cushing&rsquo;s syndrome is discussed in detail separately.

Normal ranges vary substantially, depending on the method used, so it is essential to interpret test results in the context of the appropriate normal range. On-line catalogs and laboratory result forms provide the reference range and (sometimes) the test methodology. For immunoassays, it may be necessary to contact the laboratory or review the assay kit information to determine whether there is cross-reactivity with non-cortisol substances.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H192363607\"><span class=\"h3\">Antibody based</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some immunoassays are relatively nonspecific because of cross-reaction with other steroids and steroid metabolites (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a>, the biologically active metabolite of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, 6-beta-hydroxycortisol, an inactive metabolite of cortisol and A-ring dihydro- and tetrahydro metabolites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-urinary-excretion-of-endogenous-and-exogenous-glucocorticoids/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]).</p><p>Urinary cortisol nonspecific immunoassays have normal ranges of 20 to 90 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span> (55 to 250 to 285 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/day),</span> considerably higher than the normal ranges for specific immunoassays and HPLC (10 to 55 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span> [27 to 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/day])</span>. Results obtained with nonspecific immunoassays should be interpreted with caution, recognizing the possibility that non-cortisol substances are being measured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-urinary-excretion-of-endogenous-and-exogenous-glucocorticoids/abstract/11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-15</a>].</p><p>An example of the variability in immunoassay results comes from a study of 13 normal subjects given a single inhaled dose of one of three glucocorticoids (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluticasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluticasone</a> propionate, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> acetonide, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">budesonide</a>) or placebo. Twenty-four hour urinary cortisol excretion, as measured by four widely used immunoassays (Abbott TDX, Bayer ACS 180, DPC Immulite, ICN Corti-Cote), ranged from a 100 percent increase to 62 percent suppression of basal urinary cortisol excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-urinary-excretion-of-endogenous-and-exogenous-glucocorticoids/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

In addition to HPLC, urinary cortisol can be assayed by combined GC-MS, in which cortisol metabolites or other interfering substances are also measured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-urinary-excretion-of-endogenous-and-exogenous-glucocorticoids/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Although urinary cortisol represents less than 1 percent of the cortisol secreted each day, it provides a valid index of cortisol secretion. Because it reflects 24-hour serum cortisol concentrations, one should be suspicious of a high urinary cortisol value in a patient with a normal evening serum cortisol concentration and of a low urinary cortisol value in a patient with a normal morning serum cortisol concentration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H177133931\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypercortisolism/adrenal insufficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The binding capacity of CBG is nearly saturated at normal rates of cortisol secretion.

Urinary 17-OHCS excretion, on the other hand, continues to rise at a nearly constant rate.

Therefore, UFC is unaffected by medications and medical conditions that affect CBG, such as oral estrogen use, which increases CBG and serum cortisol concentrations, while UFC is unchanged. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Urinary cortisol'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are a number of assay methods for measuring urinary cortisol excretion.
