Using a specific assay for albumin is a more sensitive technique. The normal rate of albumin excretion is less than 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/min);</span> persistent albumin excretion between 30 and 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (20 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/min)</span> is called moderately increased albuminuria (formerly called &quot;microalbuminuria&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Albumin excretion above 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/min)</span> is considered to represent overt or dipstick positive proteinuria (also called severely increased albuminuria [formerly called &quot;macroalbuminuria&quot;]). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-staging-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and staging of chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The distinction between the terms &quot;albuminuria&quot; and &quot;proteinuria&quot; is discussed elsewhere in detail.

This is no longer thought to be the case, as albuminuria levels are quite variable early in the course of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. By comparison, moderately increased albuminuria is often present at diagnosis in patients with type 2 diabetes and may reflect underlying cardiovascular disease rather than diabetic nephropathy. Yearly screening for moderately increased albuminuria is recommended in patients with both type 1 diabetes (starting five years after disease onset) and type 2 diabetes (starting at disease onset). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Moderately increased albuminuria (microalbuminuria) in type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Moderately increased albuminuria (microalbuminuria) in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to being associated with diabetic nephropathy, moderately increased albuminuria has also been associated with cardiovascular disease in both nondiabetic and diabetic patients.

Moderately increased albuminuria is unlikely if the albumin excretion rate is below 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/min</span> in a timed collection or the urine albumin concentration is less than 20 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> in a random specimen. Higher values (particularly those just above this range) may represent false positive results and should be confirmed by repeated measurements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>There are also a variety of semiquantitative dipsticks, such as Clinitek Microalbumin Dipsticks and Micral-Test II test strips, which can be used to test for moderately increased albuminuria if urine albumin excretion cannot be directly measured. The reported sensitivity and specificity of these tests range from 80 to 97 percent and 33 to 80 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>The dipstick assessment, however, is the least sensitive and specific for determination of albuminuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. One problem with measuring the urine albumin concentration or estimating it with a sensitive dipstick is that false negative and false positive results can occur since the urine albumin concentration is determined by the urine volume as well as the amount of albuminuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Thus, at a particular rate of albumin excretion, a substantial increase or decrease in urine volume will respectively lower and raise the urine albumin concentration. The confounding effect of the urine volume can be minimized by repeated measurements on early morning specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Albumin-to-creatinine ratio</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The confounding effect of variations in urine volume on the urine albumin concentration can be avoided by calculation of the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio in an untimed urine specimen. A value 30 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g</span> of creatinine (or, using standard (SI) units, 3.4 to 34 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mmol</span> of creatinine) suggests that albumin excretion is between 30 and 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> and therefore that moderately increased albuminuria is probably present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Values above 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g</span> (or 34 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mmol)</span> are indicative of severely increased albuminuria (formerly called &quot;macroalbuminuria&quot;). This classification system requires that at least two of three specimens fall within the high or very high albuminuric range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>In one report, 24-hour urine collections and random, single-void urine specimens for albumin and creatinine were obtained in 14 normal subjects, 13 with type 1 diabetes, and 12 with type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A close correlation was noted between the two measurements and the within-patient variability was small. A random albumin-to-creatinine ratio above 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g</span> had a sensitivity of 100 percent for the detection of moderately increased albuminuria. Similar findings have been noted by others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Limitations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are three important caveats that must be considered to maximize the reliability of the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vigorous exercise can cause a transient increase in albumin excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. As a result, patients should refrain from vigorous exercise in the 24 hours prior to the test.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal time to measure the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio is uncertain. The best data come from reports that primarily evaluated patients without diabetes. In an initial study, the best correlation with a 24 hour urine collection occurred with samples obtained after the first morning void and before bedtime [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. By contrast, a later and larger study found the best correlation with the first morning void although the difference with collections at other times was not significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Given the uncertainty, we suggest that first morning void specimens are preferred and, if this cannot be done, serial specimens should always be obtained at the same time of day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The accuracy of the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio will be diminished if creatinine excretion is substantially different from the expected value; this is particularly important in patients with borderline values. Albumin excretion will be underestimated in a muscular man with a high rate of creatinine excretion and overestimated in a cachectic patient in whom muscle mass and creatinine excretion are markedly reduced. The ratio also varies with <span class=\"nowrap\">race/ethnicity</span> in the United States, as creatinine excretion is significantly higher among non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans than among non-Hispanic whites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Recommendations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measurement of the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio in an untimed urinary sample is the preferred screening strategy for moderately increased albuminuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/6,11,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11,18</a>]. This test has the following advantages: it does not require early morning or timed collections, it gives a quantitative result that correlates with the 24-hour urine values over a wide range of protein excretion, it is simple to perform and inexpensive, and repeat values can be easily obtained to ascertain that moderately increased albuminuria, if present, is persistent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CORRELATION OF MODERATELY INCREASED ALBUMINURIA (MICROALBUMINURIA) WITH CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Post hoc analyses in different patient populations have suggested that, in addition to its relation to renal disease, moderate increases in albuminuria (formerly called &quot;microalbuminuria&quot;) over time are an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease and early cardiovascular mortality in patients with and without diabetes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/19-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-38</a>]. Among patients with chronic kidney disease, observational studies have suggested a graded increase in coronary risk with the presence of overt proteinuria as measured with a urinary dipstick.

For every 10-fold increase in the albumin-to-creatinine ratio, the risk of the composite end point of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke increased by 57 percent and the risk of cardiovascular death by 98 percent among nondiabetics. The respective increases in risk for diabetics were 39 and 47 percent. A subsequent analysis of this trial showed that the risk of the composite end point of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke was reduced among participants who had a substantial reduction in moderately increased albuminuria at the one-year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Population-based studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of population-based studies have identified moderately increased albuminuria as a significant predictor of cardiovascular risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/21,22,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22,40</a>].

Moderately increased albuminuria, and even lower levels of albumin excretion (&ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> [20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/min]</span> or urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio &ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g),</span> have been associated with cardiovascular disease that is additive to conventional risk factors in both nondiabetic and diabetic patients. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction, terminology, and definitions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Correlation of moderately increased albuminuria (microalbuminuria) with cardiovascular disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measurement of the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio in an untimed urinary sample is the preferred screening strategy for moderately increased albuminuria. In order to maximize the reliability of the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio, patients should refrain from vigorous exercise in the 24 hours prior to the test since vigorous exercise can cause a transient increase in albumin excretion. In addition, the accuracy of the albumin-to-creatinine ratio will be diminished if creatinine excretion is substantially different from the expected value, such as in a muscular or cachectic individual. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Detection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mechanism by which moderately increased albuminuria is associated with cardiovascular disease is not well understood. However, moderately increased albuminuria appears to be a signal that the vasculature, particularly the endothelium, is not functioning normally. Among diabetic patients, the degree of coronary endothelial dysfunction appears to be greater in patients with moderately increased albuminuria and may be related to hyperglycemia-induced alterations in extracellular matrix, such as decreased density of heparan sulfate proteoglycans. This abnormality can lead to increased microvascular permeability, resulting in moderately increased albuminuria at the glomerulus and perhaps increased lipoprotein deposition in peripheral vessels.

We also screen for moderately increased albuminuria among nondiabetic patients at increased risk for chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease, such as those with hypertension and the metabolic syndrome. We do <strong>not</strong> screen for moderately increased albuminuria in the general population of nondiabetic patients without any such risk factors, since the value of screening in these patients is unclear; the ability of any therapies to provide benefit in this setting is unknown, and it is not cost effective.
