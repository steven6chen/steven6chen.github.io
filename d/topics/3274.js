Chagas myocarditis is the most common cause of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy in Latin America [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-heart-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>The treatment and prognosis of Chagas heart disease will be reviewed here.

Cardiac involvement and prognosis in the acute phase of <em>T. cruzi</em> is discussed separately.

The indeterminate form has been defined as a form of chronic <em>T. cruzi</em> infection in which anti-<em>T. cruzi</em> antibodies are present but no signs or symptoms of Chagas cardiomyopathy or gastrointestinal involvement are identified. Various criteria have been proposed to define the indeterminate form, as discussed separately.

The combination of left ventricular systolic dysfunction and NSVT was associated with particularly high risk (15.1-fold increased risk of death) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-heart-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Although data are limited, most experts recommend antitrypanosomal therapy to treat individuals with the indeterminate form of CD (especially children). The role of antitrypanosomal drugs in acute and indeterminate disease is discussed in detail separately.

In patients with advanced heart disease, the focus of management is supportive care for heart failure (HF), arrhythmia, and thromboembolism. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H372251532\"><span class=\"h3\">T. cruzi infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the absence of definitive data, we suggest antitrypanosomal therapy to treat patients with early chronic CD, even if there is an established mild cardiomyopathy (ie, only simple electrocardiographic [ECG] abnormalities, Kuschnir class 1, <strong>and</strong> Rassi score &lt;10) but not in those with more advanced stages of CCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-heart-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Simple ECG abnormalities include isolated incomplete right bundle branch block, first degree atrioventricular block, or sinus bradycardia, but not premature ventricular beats on the 12-lead ECG or complex ventricular arrhythmia on Holter monitoring. Kuschnir class 1 includes patients with reactive serology and ECG abnormalities but no cardiac enlargement on chest radiograph [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-heart-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Benznidazole has the best safety and efficacy profile, and therefore is viewed by most experts as the first-line treatment. Both drugs should preferably be given after meals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-heart-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

Limited available evidence suggests that timely antitrypanosomal therapy may be beneficial in selected patients with early chronic CD. An unblinded, nonrandomized trial in 566 patients with chronic CD and without HF found that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benznidazole-united-states-available-via-cdc-drug-service-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benznidazole</a> treatment was associated with less frequent clinical progression of CD (4 versus 14 percent) compared with no treatment over median 9.8-year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-heart-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Fewer treated patients developed ECG abnormalities (5 versus 16 percent). </p><p>The best data on antitrypanosomal therapy in patients with CCC come from the multicenter double-blind BENEFIT trial, which randomly assigned 2854 patients with CCC to receive either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benznidazole-united-states-available-via-cdc-drug-service-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benznidazole</a> or placebo for up to 80 days with mean 5.4-year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-heart-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No reduction on the primary composite outcome (the first of the following events: death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, sustained ventricular tachycardia, insertion of a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, cardiac transplantation, new HF, stroke, or other thromboembolic event) was observed (27.5 percent in the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benznidazole-united-states-available-via-cdc-drug-service-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benznidazole</a> group and 29.1 percent in the placebo group [hazard ratio 0.93, 95% CI 0.81-1.07]). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Despite the neutral overall result, all components of the primary composite end point were nominally less frequent in the treated group than in the placebo group, and the reduction in the number of hospitalizations for cardiovascular causes in the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benznidazole-united-states-available-via-cdc-drug-service-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benznidazole</a> group was significant.

A systematic review of pharmacologic interventions for HF in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy identified two trials with a total of 69 subjects comparing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carvedilol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carvedilol</a> against placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-heart-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>] and one trial with 39 subjects comparing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosuvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rosuvastatin</a> versus placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-heart-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A meta-analysis of the two carvedilol trials yielded inconclusive results. The rosuvastatin trial was also inconclusive. Because all therapies employed in CD patients are empirically extrapolated from trials performed in patients with HF of other etiologies, the morbidity and mortality benefit from each class of drugs in CD patients is uncertain. This is especially relevant in the case of beta-blockers, since CD patients often have bradycardia that may limit their use, particularly with concomitant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-heart-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3861828313\"><span class=\"h4\">Cardiac transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiac transplantation is an accepted therapy for patients with refractory HF caused by CD but is associated with risk of reactivation of <em>Trypanosoma cruzi</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-heart-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/21-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-31</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H372250898\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of CCC is tailored to individual cardiac manifestations. (See <a href=\"#H372251508\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart failure (HF) due to Chagas disease (CD) is generally treated as HF due to other causes except for some specific caveats including watching for marked bradycardia with beta blocker use, particularly with concurrent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> therapy. (See <a href=\"#H372251539\" class=\"local\">'Heart failure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest antitrypanosomal therapy to treat patients with early chronic CD, but <strong>not</strong> in those with established CCC (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
