Many survivors live with significant disabilities, resulting in major socioeconomic burden as well. In 2000, the economic impact of TBI in the United States was estimated to be $9.2 billion in lifetime medical costs and $51.2 billion in productivity losses.</p><p>One of the major advances over the past two decades in the care of patients with severe head injury has been the development of standardized approaches that follow international and national guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-severe-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. The intent of these guidelines has been to use existing evidence to provide recommendations for current care in order to lessen heterogeneity and improve patient outcomes. Unfortunately, the lack of randomized clinical trials addressing many aspects of care of the severe TBI patient has meant that the strength of supporting data for most treatment concepts is relatively weak. Despite this caveat, there is evidence that treatment in centers with neurosurgical support, especially in settings where protocol-driven neurointensive care units operate based on the above-referenced guidelines, is associated with better patient outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-severe-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/7-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-14</a>]. Many expert panels recommend that treatment of severe TBI should be centralized in large trauma centers that offer neurosurgical treatment and access to specialized neurocritical care.</p><p>Patients with severe head injury may frequently have other traumatic injuries to internal organs, lungs, limbs, or the spinal cord. Thus, the management of the patient with severe head injury is often complex and requires a multidisciplinary approach and lends itself to protocol-based treatment and standardized hospital order sets derived from the previously referenced guidelines.</p><p>This topic discusses the management of acute severe TBI. The epidemiology and pathophysiology of TBI, the management of mild TBI, acute spinal cord injury, and other aspects of care of the trauma patient are discussed separately.

In a meta-analysis of clinical trials and population-based studies, hypoxia (PaO<sub>2</sub> &lt;60 mmHg) and hypotension (systolic blood pressure [BP] &lt;90 mmHg) were present in 50 and 30 percent of patients, respectively, and were each associated with a higher likelihood of a poor outcome: hypoxia (OR 2.14), hypotension (OR 2.67) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-severe-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Changes in prehospital management that aim to normalize oxygenation and BP have improved outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-severe-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/21-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-25</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early endotracheal intubation is generally recommended for patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8 or less if performed by well-trained personnel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81854\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81854 \">table 1</a>). The value of prehospital intubation is controversial, with studies finding conflicting results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-severe-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In one randomized trial of 312 patients with severe TBI performed in Australia, prehospital rapid sequence intubation by paramedics was associated with better functional outcome at six months compared with intubation in hospital (51 versus 39 percent of patients with favorable outcome on GCS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-severe-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, another study in San Diego, California found that prehospital intubation was associated with an increased mortality, perhaps due to inadvertent hyperventilation, transient hypoxia, or longer time at scene prior to transport [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-severe-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]; hemodynamic instability induced during intubation is another potential explanation for adverse outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-severe-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. A benefit from prehospital intubation by paramedics requires extensive training and is not widely generalizable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-severe-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. If this expertise is not available, bag-mask ventilation is recommended.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevention of hypotension in the prehospital setting is best accomplished by adequate fluid resuscitation using isotonic crystalloids.

While there is no clear indication for routine follow-up CT scans in the absence of clinical change or changes in physiologic parameters such as ICP, practice varies considerably in this regard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-severe-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. Many centers do routinely order follow-up imaging. Of note, parenchymal contrast extravasation, as with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), may predict a higher risk of hemorrhage progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-severe-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

Surgery was associated with decreased ICP and shorter stays in the intensive care unit (ICU), but worse outcome on the extended GCS at six months.

These should be continuously monitored. Isotonic fluids (normal saline) should be used to maintain euvolemia. A subgroup analysis in the large Saline versus Albumin Fluid Evaluation (SAFE) study found that for patients with TBI, fluid resuscitation with albumin was associated with a higher mortality as compared with normal saline (33 versus 20 percent); this risk was even more pronounced in those with severe TBI (42 versus 22 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-severe-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Electrolyte imbalances are common in patients with TBI and should be regularly assessed along with other laboratory parameters.</p><p>Other extracranial traumatic injuries are managed simultaneously.

While DVT risk can be further reduced with antithrombotic therapy, this has to be weighed against the potential risk of hemorrhage expansion, which is greatest in the first 24 to 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-severe-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/61-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-63</a>]. The use and timing of antithrombotic agents in patients with TBI must therefore be individualized according to the degree of intracranial bleeding and the perceived risk of DVT. No randomized studies have examined the risks and benefits of antithrombotic agents in this setting. While some observational studies suggest that antithrombotic therapy may not be associated with the increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage expansion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-severe-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/64-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-66</a>], others have found a higher rate of hemorrhage progression with the use of low molecular weight heparin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-severe-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].

ICP monitoring in severe TBI patients with a normal CT scan may be indicated if two of the following features are present: age &gt;40 years, motor posturing, systolic BP &lt;90 mmHg. A ventricular catheter connected to a strain gauge transducer is the most accurate and cost-effective method of ICP monitoring and has the therapeutic advantage of allowing for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage to treat rises in ICP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F56391\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56391 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-severe-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].

One randomized study of 324 patients with severe TBI hospitalized in Bolivia or Ecuador found no differences in outcomes among those patients assigned to a protocol for monitoring ICP and focusing treatment on maintaining pressures at 20 mmHg or less compared with patients assigned to a treatment protocol based on imaging and clinical examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-severe-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. The results of this study suggest that further research is needed to assess the role of ICP monitoring as well as targeted treatments of ICP in the management of severe TBI.</p><p>Most guidelines and clinical protocols recommend that treatment for elevated ICP should be initiated when ICP rises above 20 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-severe-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Ventricular drainage is generally attempted first.

Regarding ICP management, control of ventilation helps prevent increases in intrathoracic pressure that may elevate central venous pressures and impair cerebral venous drainage.</p><p>Hyperventilation can be used to reduce ICP. With hyperventilation, PaCO<sub>2</sub> decreases, thereby leading to cerebral vasoconstriction, which then results in decreased cerebral blood volume and ICP. However, hyperventilation-induced vasoconstriction may also cause secondary ischemia and may thereby worsen outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-severe-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/94-96\" class=\"abstract_t\">94-96</a>]. Hyperventilation can also increase extracellular lactate and glutamate levels that may contribute to secondary brain injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-severe-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. In one randomized study, patients hyperventilated to a PaCO<sub>2</sub> of 25 mmHg for five days had a worse clinical outcome than nonhyperventilated controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-severe-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>].</p><p>Based upon these competing concerns, guidelines recommend avoiding hyperventilation, especially in the acute phase (the first 24 to 48 hours) following TBI. Mild to moderate hyperventilation can be considered at later stages, but PaCO<sub>2</sub> of less than 30 mmHg should be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-severe-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. Multimodality monitoring of cerebral oxygenation and metabolism (see <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Advanced neuromonitoring'</a> below) should also be used where available with therapeutic hyperventilation to monitor its effects and prevent ischemic episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-severe-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/95,96,100\" class=\"abstract_t\">95,96,100</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Sedation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sedative medications and pharmacologic paralysis are often used in patients with severe head injury and elevated ICP. The rationale is that appropriate sedation may lower ICP by reducing metabolic demand. Sedation may also ameliorate ventilator asynchrony and blunt sympathetic responses of hypertension and tachycardia. These possible beneficial effects are counterbalanced by the potential for these drugs to cause hypotension and cerebral vasodilation that in turn may aggravate cerebral hypoperfusion and elevate ICP. </p><p>While there are a number of agents that can be used, we prefer to use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> because of its short duration of action that allows intermittent clinical neurologic assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-severe-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. Anecdotally, propofol sedation can produce ICP reductions. Propofol also has putative neuroprotective effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-severe-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. In one trial, propofol appeared to be associated with better ICP control and a trend toward better outcomes compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> sedation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-severe-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. However, some reports suggest that patients with TBI are at particular risk of developing the rare, but potentially fatal, propofol infusion syndrome (severe metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia, renal failure, and cardiovascular collapse) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-severe-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/104,105\" class=\"abstract_t\">104,105</a>]. As a result, it is suggested that when used in TBI, the infusion rate of propofol not exceed 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per hour and patients be monitored for electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, lactic acidosis, and elevations in creatinine kinase and myoglobin.

A loading dose of 5 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> is given as a bolus, followed by 1 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per hour.

However, high bolus doses of opioids were found to cause transient increases in ICP, which may warrant avoidance of that treatment approach.

Monitoring of cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is advised (see <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Cerebral perfusion pressure'</a> below) to evaluate the somewhat unpredictable effects of these agents on BP and ICP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Cerebral perfusion pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Through autoregulation, the normal cerebral vasculature maintains an adequate CBF across a wide range (50 to 150 mmHg) of mean arterial blood pressure (MAP).

In these patients, a rise in MAP can lead to elevated ICP due to increased cerebral blood volume and hyperemia, while drops in MAP may be associated with hypoperfusion and ischemia. Patients with impaired cerebral autoregulation are described as &quot;pressure passive.&quot;</p><p>While optimization of CBF is a foundation of TBI treatment, bedside measurement of CBF is not easily obtained.

However, subsequent studies have suggested that this strategy does not improve outcome and rather risks severe extracerebral complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-severe-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/119-121\" class=\"abstract_t\">119-121</a>]. According to guidelines published in 2007, the recommended CPP target is 60 mmHg, avoiding levels below 50 mmHg and above 70 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-severe-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/122-124\" class=\"abstract_t\">122-124</a>].

This may have a more substantial effect on CBF and obviate the use of fluids and inotropic agents.
