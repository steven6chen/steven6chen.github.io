In contrast to its name, PG is neither an infectious nor gangrenous condition. The most common presentation of PG is an inflammatory papule or pustule that progresses to a painful ulcer with a violaceous undermined border and a purulent base (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F83692%7EDERM%2F72260%7EDERM%2F83691%7EDERM%2F52291%7EGAST%2F52528\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83692 graphicRef72260 graphicRef83691 graphicRef52291 graphicRef52528 \">picture 1A-E</a>). PG may also present with bullous, vegetative, peristomal, and extracutaneous lesions. </p><p>More than half of patients with PG develop the disorder in association with an underlying systemic disease. Inflammatory bowel disease, hematologic disorders, and arthritis represent the most frequent comorbidities. </p><p>A diagnosis of PG rests upon the recognition of consistent clinical and histologic findings and the exclusion of other inflammatory or ulcerative cutaneous disorders. There are no pathognomonic, clinical, or histologic findings of PG.</p><p>The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of PG will be discussed here. The treatment and prognosis of PG and other neutrophilic dermatoses are reviewed separately.

Individuals of any age may be affected, including children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. PG most commonly develops in young and middle aged adults, with an average age of onset between 40 and 60 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. Between the sexes, women are more frequently affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24503921\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Consistent with its categorization as a neutrophilic dermatosis, PG is characterized by neutrophil-predominant infiltrates in the skin. However, the reason for the development of the inflammatory process that leads to PG remains unclear. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neutrophilic-dermatoses\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neutrophilic dermatoses&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Past theories on the pathogenesis of PG included contributory roles for occult bacterial infection, circulating autoantibodies, and the Shwartzman reaction (a local immune response to bacterial endotoxin resulting in tissue necrosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. As subsequent studies found little support for these theories, abnormalities in neutrophil function, genetic variations, and dysregulation of the innate immune system became the primary factors considered to contribute to the pathogenesis of PG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neutrophil dysfunction </strong>&ndash; Neutrophils are prominent in pathology specimens from PG, and the response of PG to anti-neutrophil pharmacologic agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a>, suggests an important role for these cells. In addition, one study found abnormalities in neutrophil trafficking that may have been related to aberrant intracellular metabolic oscillations in a patient with PG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Genetic factors </strong>&ndash; Genetic susceptibility may contribute to the development of PG. Familial cases of PG have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. In addition, the PAPA syndrome (OMIM #604416), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by pyogenic sterile arthritis, PG, and acne has been linked to mutations in the <em>PSTPIP1</em><span class=\"nowrap\">/<em>CD2BP1</em></span> gene on chromosome 15q, a gene that encodes <span class=\"nowrap\">proline/serine/threonine</span> phosphatase-interacting protein 1 (also known as CD2 antigen-binding protein 1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Mutations in this gene may promote inflammation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=periodic-fever-syndromes-and-other-autoinflammatory-diseases-an-overview#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Periodic fever syndromes and other autoinflammatory diseases: An overview&quot;, section on 'PAPA syndrome'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Systemic inflammation </strong>&ndash; PG often occurs in association with other autoinflammatory disorders (eg, inflammatory bowel disease and arthritis), suggesting that dysregulation of the immune system may contribute to PG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Increased production of cytokines involved in leukocyte function, such as interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-23, may be relevant factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. In addition, the response of PG to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> and other anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha agents suggests an important role for TNF-alpha in PG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

With the exception of vegetative PG, lesion development is often rapid and the level of pain is often greater than expected based upon the appearance of the ulcer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Fever may or may not be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Pathergy, a term used to describe the induction or exacerbation of PG in sites of incidental or iatrogenic trauma, is frequently mentioned in descriptions of the clinical behavior of PG. However, not all patients with PG exhibit this feature. Data on the proportion of patients with PG who experience pathergy are limited. In a retrospective study of 103 patients with PG, pathergy was documented in the medical records of 31 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In a series of 166 patients with PG, 25 (15 percent) experienced 33 episodes of postsurgical recurrence or exacerbation of the disease; factors associated with increased risk of pathergy included open surgical procedures, Mohs surgery, and PG present at the time of procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4373563\"><span class=\"h2\">Subtypes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Descriptions of the major variants of PG are provided below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ulcerative (classic) PG </strong>&ndash; The ulcerative variant of PG represents the vast majority of cases of PG. Ulcerative PG typically begins as a tender, inflammatory papule, pustule, or vesicle that develops on normal-appearing skin or at a site of trauma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F59459%7ERHEUM%2F53733\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59459 graphicRef53733 \">picture 2A-B</a>). The lower extremities and trunk are the most common sites of involvement, though lesions may occur in other areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The initial inflammatory lesion subsequently expands peripherally and degenerates centrally, leading to ulcer formation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F83692%7EDERM%2F72260%7EDERM%2F83691%7EDERM%2F52291%7EGAST%2F52528\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83692 graphicRef72260 graphicRef83691 graphicRef52291 graphicRef52528 \">picture 1A-E</a>). The edge of the ulcer usually exhibits a bluish or violaceous color and demonstrates an undermined quality. Irregular expansion of the involved tissue may lead to a serpiginous configuration. The base of the ulcer is purulent and necrotic, and the depth of the ulcer often extends into subcutaneous fat and occasionally reaches the fascia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients may have a single lesion or multiple lesions in various stages of development. Ulcers typically resolve with atrophic, cribriform scars.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bullous (atypical) PG </strong>&ndash; Bullous PG is a less common, superficial variant of PG that is most commonly seen in patients with PG related to hematologic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Unlike ulcerative PG, the arms and face are the most common sites of involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>]. Patients typically present with the rapid development of blue-gray, inflammatory bullae in the involved areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The bullae quickly erode, resulting in superficial ulcers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F55967\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55967 \">picture 3</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Due to the strong association between bullous PG and hematologic disease, patients who present without an associated hematologic disorder should be followed closely for the development of a hematologic disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pustular PG </strong>&ndash; Pustular PG usually occurs in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, and tends to arise during periods of acute exacerbations of bowel disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Affected patients exhibit the rapid development of painful pustules surrounded by erythema (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F83690\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83690 \">picture 4</a>). Concomitant fever and arthralgias are common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Pyostomatitis vegetans, which presents with multiple small pustules and erosions on the oral mucosa, may be a variant of pustular PG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vegetative PG </strong>&ndash; Vegetative PG (also known as superficial granulomatous pyoderma) is a localized, solitary, superficial form of PG that presents as an indolent, mildly painful nodule, plaque, or ulcer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F83904\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83904 \">picture 5</a>). A verrucous quality is often present. The undermined borders and purulent bases of ulcerative PG are absent. The head and neck are the most common sites for vegetative PG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4373845\"><span class=\"h2\">Special sites</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the morphologic subtypes reviewed above, other terms have been used to describe certain presentations of PG. Examples include peristomal PG, genital PG, and extracutaneous PG.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Peristomal PG </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Peristomal PG is an uncommon manifestation of PG that is characterized by the development of lesions consistent with ulcerative PG adjacent to a stoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F72285\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72285 \">picture 6</a>). This typically occurs in patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn&rsquo;s disease and may develop months to a few decades after placement of a stoma. Trauma caused by maintenance of the stoma or irritation from stoma secretions may play a role in the development of peristomal PG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Genital PG </strong>&ndash; Genital PG may involve the vulva, penis, or scrotum. Lesions resemble those of ulcerative PG (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F83689\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83689 \">picture 7</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Extracutaneous PG </strong>&ndash; Rarely, PG involves extracutaneous sites. In such cases, sterile neutrophilic infiltration develops in sites such as the lungs, intestine, cornea, liver, spleen, heart, bones, muscle, and central nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/24-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-36</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Postoperative PG </strong>&ndash; Postoperative PG is the development of PG in a surgical site, usually within two weeks after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The initial symptoms are surgical-site erythema and extreme pain out of proportion to the physical examination followed by wound dehiscence or the development of punctate ulcerations that coalesce into larger ulcers. Postoperative PG appears to be more common in women than in men. Common sites of involvement are the breasts and abdomen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4373281\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSOCIATED DISORDERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>More than 50 percent of patients with PG have an associated systemic disease, most commonly inflammatory bowel disease, arthritis, and hematologic disease or hematologic malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. The proportion of patients with specific comorbidities varies among studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5-7,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7,38</a>]. In one of the largest studies, a retrospective cohort study of 356 adults with PG, 161 (45 percent) had associated comorbidities, including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>146 patients (41 percent) with inflammatory bowel disease</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>73 patients (21 percent) with inflammatory arthritis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>23 patients (7 percent) with solid organ malignant neoplasms</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>21 patients (6 percent) with hematologic malignant neoplasms</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>17 patients (5 percent) with hematologic disorders (monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, myelodysplastic syndrome, or polycythemia vera)</p><p/><p>Additional findings of this study suggest that patient age influences risk for specific comorbidities. Patients aged 65 years or older were more likely to have associated rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, solid organ malignant neoplasms, hematologic malignant neoplasms, and hematologic disorders than younger patients. Inflammatory bowel disease was more common in patients under the age of 65 years.</p><p>PG may precede or follow the diagnosis of an associated disorder and may or may not parallel the clinical course of the associated disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,22</a>].</p><p>PG may occur as a feature of autoinflammatory syndromes, such as PAPA (pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne) syndrome, PAPASH (pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, acne, and suppurative hidradenitis [hidradenitis suppurativa]) syndrome, and PASH (pyoderma gangrenosum, acne, and suppurative hidradenitis) syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/39-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-42</a>]. PAPA syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder and occurs secondary to a defect in the <em>PSTPIP1</em><span class=\"nowrap\">/<em>CD2BP1</em></span> gene. PAPASH syndrome has been described in an adolescent in whom a novel mutation in the <em>PSTPIP1</em> gene was detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

In patients known to have diseases associated with PG, the development of an ulcer should raise suspicion for this diagnosis. In addition, once PG has been diagnosed, patients should be evaluated for the presence of an associated underlying disease.

Examples of findings attainable via a patient history that support a diagnosis of PG include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapid course of lesion development</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial lesion consistent with papule, pustule, or vesicle</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain out of proportion to lesion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of preceding trauma (pathergy)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of disorders associated with PG (see <a href=\"#H4373281\" class=\"local\">'Associated disorders'</a> above)</p><p/><p>The physical examination is useful for identifying the extent of disease, narrowing the differential diagnosis, and detecting clinical signs of PG-associated disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4373900\"><span class=\"h2\">Biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since the histopathologic findings of PG are nonspecific, biopsies are most useful for excluding other disorders that may present with similar clinical findings. A biopsy is indicated in patients without a preceding history of PG and in patients with established PG who present with lesions with atypical features or lesions that fail to respond as expected to therapy. Although clinicians are often concerned about biopsy-induced pathergy, the need to rule out other disorders and ensure proper treatment supersedes concern for the induction of an exacerbation of PG.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H603219\"><span class=\"h3\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal procedure for biopsy is an elliptical incisional biopsy that incorporates both the inflamed lesion border and ulcer edge and extends vertically into the subcutaneous fat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. A tissue specimen that includes the inflamed border should be sent for routine histopathologic examination and microbial stains. In addition, a specimen from the ulcer should be sent for culture to evaluate for bacterial, fungal, and atypical mycobacterial infections. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H603233\"><span class=\"h3\">Pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specimens taken from the earliest lesions of PG demonstrate perifollicular inflammation and intradermal abscess formation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F55462%7EDERM%2F79287\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55462 graphicRef79287 \">picture 8A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Once lesions progress to ulceration, epidermal and superficial dermal necrosis with an underlying mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate and abscess formation are typically detected. Giant cells may be found, and tissue from the edge of the lesion may demonstrate vascular changes suggestive of lymphocytic vasculitis. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis may also be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Additional findings may be identified based upon the subtype of PG. Specimens from bullous PG demonstrate subepidermal bullae. Pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, sinus tracts, and palisading granulomas are features consistent with vegetative PG.</p><p>Direct immunofluorescence studies yield nonspecific findings in PG. Deposition of IgM, C3, and fibrin in vessel walls may be detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Because of the nonspecific nature of the results, direct immunofluorescence is usually only conducted when additional clinical findings indicate a need to exclude autoimmune bullous disease, lupus, or vasculitis as a cause of ulceration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

Nonspecific findings such as leukocytosis, elevation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and elevation of C-reactive protein levels may be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p>Laboratory tests are most useful for narrowing the differential diagnosis and identifying the presence of PG-associated diseases. Recommendations for the work-up of these patients vary. We typically obtain the following studies in patients with clinical and histopathologic findings consistent with PG: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Complete blood count</strong> (to evaluate for underlying hematologic disorders)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Comprehensive metabolic panel</strong> (to evaluate for hepatic or renal dysfunction and glucose abnormalities prior to initiation of systemic glucocorticoids or immunosuppressive agents) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Antinuclear antibody titer</strong> (to evaluate for the presence of systemic lupus erythematosus or collagen vascular disorders in association with PG)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies</strong> (to evaluate for granulomatous vasculitis as a cause of ulceration)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypercoagulability studies </strong>(antiphospholipid antibody screen to evaluate for antiphospholipid syndrome as a cause of ulceration; based upon clinical suspicion, other tests to evaluate for thrombotic states [eg, cryoglobulins, Factor V Leiden, methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase]) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hepatitis panel</strong> (to evaluate for associated hepatitis B or C, particularly for patients in whom immunomodulatory therapy is considered)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rheumatoid factor</strong> (as a component of the evaluation for cryoglobulinemia and rheumatoid arthritis) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum immunofixation electrophoresis (to evaluate for paraproteins)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chest radiography</strong> (to evaluate for presence of extracutaneous involvement and for possible infection prior to the initiation of immunosuppressive therapy)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Colonoscopy</strong> (to evaluate for underlying inflammatory bowel disease unless another cause of PG is identified)</p><p/><p>Additional tests to evaluate for associated disorders and disorders in the differential diagnosis are ordered based upon clinical suspicion for specific diseases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4374004\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Due to the lack of a definitive test for PG, misdiagnosis can occur. In one retrospective study, 15 of 157 consecutive patients seen at an academic institution and given a diagnosis of PG (10 percent) were subsequently found to have an alternative diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. </p><p>Vascular occlusion disorders, venous disease, vasculitis, malignancy, cutaneous infection, drugs, exogenous tissue injury, and ulcerative inflammatory disorders (eg, cutaneous Crohn&rsquo;s disease and ulcerative necrobiosis lipoidica) may be mistaken for PG (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F72103\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72103 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Antiphospholipid-antibody syndrome is one of the most common disorders mistaken for PG; other more commonly confused disorders include venous stasis ulcers, Wegener&rsquo;s granulomatosis, factitial ulcers, sporotrichosis, polyarteritis nodosa, livedoid vasculopathy, angiocentric T cell lymphoma, and cryoglobulinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Necrotizing fasciitis is an additional potential misdiagnosis.

Although PG may occur at any age, there is a predilection for young and middle-aged adults and women. (See <a href=\"#H24503914\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The factors that contribute to the development of PG are not well-understood. Factors that are postulated to contribute to PG include aberrant neutrophil function, genetic susceptibility, and dysregulation of the immune system. (See <a href=\"#H24503921\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical manifestations of PG vary. The most common presentation is ulcerative (classic) PG, which typically presents as a rapidly developing, painful purulent ulcer with a violaceous and undermined border (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F83692%7EDERM%2F72260%7EDERM%2F83691%7EDERM%2F52291%7EGAST%2F52528\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83692 graphicRef72260 graphicRef83691 graphicRef52291 graphicRef52528 \">picture 1A-E</a>). Other variants of PG include bullous, pustular, and vegetative presentations. PG may also develop in peristomal, genital, and extracutaneous locations. (See <a href=\"#H24503928\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More than 50 percent of patients with PG have an associated systemic disease. The strongest associations are between PG and inflammatory bowel disease, hematologic disorders, and arthritis. (See <a href=\"#H4373281\" class=\"local\">'Associated disorders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since the clinical and histologic findings of PG are nonspecific, PG is a diagnosis of exclusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F72103\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72103 \">table 1</a>). At a minimum, the patient evaluation should include a patient history, physical examination, and biopsy to detect findings consistent with PG and to rule out other diseases.
