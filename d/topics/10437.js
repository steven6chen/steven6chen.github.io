Unfortunately, there is no consensus regarding the optimal treatment approach for this condition.</p><p>The difficulty in treating <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> derives from several factors, including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lack of a clear understanding of the etiology of the disorder. It is generally believed that <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> is comprised of one or more disorders that have not yet been defined. This precludes development of therapies targeted at the underlying pathophysiology.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The symptoms of <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> vary considerably across patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The definitions of the condition and of measure of therapeutic outcomes vary. This is an impediment to the interpretation of study results and their application to clinical care.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are few high-quality data (eg, randomized trials) regarding the efficacy and safety of <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> treatments.</p><p/><p>No treatment is consistently effective in providing relief for all patients. This was illustrated by the Interstitial Cystitis Data Base study, in which 581 women with <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> underwent 183 different types of therapy over several years of follow-up, and no single therapy was successful in the majority of patients. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The approach to treatment of <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> is to arrive at the diagnosis using current diagnostic criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F66969\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66969 \">table 1</a>) and utilize a stepwise approach of therapeutic options based upon the characteristics and severity of the patient&rsquo;s symptoms.</p><p>Management of <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> is reviewed here. The pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of this condition are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12621791\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interstitial <span class=\"nowrap\">cystitis/bladder</span> pain syndrome <span class=\"nowrap\">(IC/BPS)</span> is a chronic pain syndrome and the etiology is not well understood. Thus, there is not curative treatment and the goal of management is to provide relief of symptoms in order to achieve an adequate quality of life.</p><p>There are many therapeutic approaches for <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> and none are proven to be helpful for all patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. We treat <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> with a stepwise approach presented here. An alternative approach is an individualized treatment plan tailored to the patient&rsquo;s primary symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9280020\"><span class=\"h2\">Stepwise approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Therapies for <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> vary by the risk of adverse effects and the invasiveness of the treatment. In the sections that follow, management approaches are organized in the order of increasing risk and, for most patients, it is reasonable to move from one level (eg, first-line to second-line) when less risky approaches have failed.</p><p>Therapies that are ineffective should be discontinued after a reasonable interval. This interval may vary by type of treatment and a reasonable interval is determined through shared decision-making by the clinician and patient.</p><p>A combination of successive or concurrent treatments may be appropriate for some patients, but each treatment should be initiated individually to be able to monitor symptom response and to discontinue ineffective therapies.</p><p>The diagnosis of <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> should be reconsidered if no improvement occurs after several trials of first- and second-line therapies. In such cases, referral to a specialist is appropriate. (See <a href=\"#H281726\" class=\"local\">'Indications for referral to a specialist'</a> below.)</p><p>Individual patient characteristics may influence the choice of therapy, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptom characteristics (severity, location, progression).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Previous effective or ineffective treatments.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Comorbidities &ndash; In patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> who have comorbid chronic conditions (eg, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, depression, anxiety), a multidisciplinary approach is required for optimal management.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient preference.</p><p/><p>Depending upon the severity and progression of the symptoms and patient preference, in certain patients, it may be reasonable to proceed rapidly to more aggressive therapies. For example, in patients with rapidly worsening symptoms, proceeding to cystoscopy with hydrodistention and intravesical treatments may be chosen if there is not a rapid response to oral agents.</p><p>The American Urological Association has issued clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. The approach presented here is consistent with these guidelines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2164226\"><span class=\"h2\">Use of analgesics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Analgesics may be used in <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> patients at any point in treatment with the goal of minimizing pain and maximizing function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. In general, pain medications are used for short-term relief for flares of bladder pain rather than as primary therapy. Their use should be guided by the risk of adverse effects and dependency. In some patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS,</span> as with other chronic pain conditions, long-term use of analgesics may be necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2164234\"><span class=\"h3\">Urinary analgesics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urinary analgesics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenazopyridine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenazopyridine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methenamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methenamine</a>) are intended for short-term use. Long-term use of these agents is discouraged, as this is potentially associated with complications such as renal or liver dysfunction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2164242\"><span class=\"h3\">Oral and transdermal analgesics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use of nonnarcotic and narcotic pain medications should be guided by the principles used to manage other chronic pain conditions. Referral to a specialist in pain management should be considered if long-term pain medication is needed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H284183\"><span class=\"h3\">Intravesical lidocaine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intravesical instillation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> with heparin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> may be used as rescue therapy for patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> with an acute episode of severe bladder pain. This treatment requires bladder catheterization and should be reserved for patients who have not found relief with urinary analgesics or nonnarcotic oral pain medications or with other <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> treatments.</p><p>Intravesical therapy is typically administered in an office setting, but patients who have not found other effective therapies and have frequent episodes of severe bladder pain are taught to administer such therapy at home by a urologic specialist.</p><p>Use of intravesical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> with heparin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> is based mostly on clinical experience. Potential adverse effects of bladder instillations of lidocaine include urinary tract infection, dysuria, urethral irritation, and increased bladder pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9280724\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL MEASURES FOR ALL PATIENTS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9281470\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient education</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step in the management of patients with interstitial <span class=\"nowrap\">cystitis/bladder</span> pain syndrome <span class=\"nowrap\">(IC/BPS)</span> is to provide education about the condition, including the diagnostic criteria, variability of symptoms, and chronic nature of the condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Normal bladder function should be reviewed.</p><p>Many patients have gone through a long diagnostic process during which they have encountered clinicians who were unfamiliar with <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> and may have regarded the symptoms with uncertainty and skepticism. Arriving at a diagnosis of <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> often provides considerable relief and validation for these patients.</p><p>It is important to counsel patients about reasonable expectations about treatment course and outcomes. Patients should be counseled that adequate symptom relief is achievable but that this may require multiple trials of different types of therapies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9281481\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of comorbid conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute conditions that may exacerbate <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> symptoms should be treated promptly. These include genitourinary disorders (eg, urinary tract infection, vulvovaginitis).</p><p>Chronic disorders associated with bladder or other pelvic pain should be treated, since amelioration of associated disorders often contributes to overall patient wellbeing. Evidence suggests that sensitization of any pelvic or abdominal viscera may result in increased bladder sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Thus, it is important to treat coexisting vulvodynia, endometriosis or other etiologies of chronic pelvic pain or dysmenorrhea, inflammatory bowel disease, diverticulitis, irritable bowel syndrome, and fibromyalgia.</p><p>Since <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> patients are often diagnosed with one or more of these conditions, treatment decisions can be complex, and collaboration with other clinicians with expertise in these conditions is usually necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome#H318782\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome&quot;, section on 'Coexisting conditions'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9281489\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychosocial support</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psychosocial support is an integral part of treatment of any chronic pain disorder. Patients may wish to be in touch with local pain support groups or with national support groups, such as the <a href=\"http://www.ichelp.org/&amp;token=e0zA0eyG78vof5t5S6hjDUzomjhv4L06qS51uf0RpsU=&amp;TOPIC_ID=8087\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Interstitial Cystitis Association</a> or the <a href=\"http://www.ic-network.com/&amp;token=c8X9oFxwC0pWK/fDfoc5UTPkl8lDhO9fyau4HlgzUMZyKvpHgNwmxarhZnxsZU0v&amp;TOPIC_ID=8087\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Interstitial Cystitis Network</a>. Some patients benefit from counseling with a psychotherapist with expertise in working with patients with chronic pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain#H2234320\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain&quot;, section on 'Behavioral medicine approaches'</a>.)</p><p>Depression and anxiety are common in patients with chronic pain and may impede treatment success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Referral for mental health evaluation may be useful when there is any suspicion that depression or anxiety is present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome#H318782\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome&quot;, section on 'Coexisting conditions'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, some patients benefit from training in stress reduction and relaxation techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/4,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,12,13</a>]. Greater levels of stress have been shown to increase <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>], and maladaptive coping strategies have been demonstrated to have an adverse effect on symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12621798\"><span class=\"h1\">FIRST-LINE THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>First-line therapies present minimal risks and should be offered to all patients. In patients with mild interstitial <span class=\"nowrap\">cystitis/bladder</span> pain syndrome <span class=\"nowrap\">(IC/BPS)</span> symptoms, first-line therapy may be effective alone. However, in our clinical experience, the majority of patients will require additional therapy for adequate symptom control.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12621819\"><span class=\"h2\">Self-care and behavior modification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Self-care practices and behavior modification should be discussed with all patients and implemented if feasible. Such strategies include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Application of local heat or cold over the bladder or perineum.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoidance of activities or food or beverages that exacerbate symptoms &ndash; Common irritants include caffeine, alcohol, artificial sweeteners, hot pepper, and vitamin C-containing foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Providing a list that indicates foods to try as well as those to limit or avoid is helpful for patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. These foods may be avoided until symptoms resolve, at which time they may be reintroduced. In our experience, most patients with food sensitivities are aware of them and have already excluded these items from their diet. Research about the impact of food on IC is very limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]; however, in a very small randomized trial, 30 patients who followed a specially developed diet experienced improvement in IC symptoms at three months and one year compared with those who followed a usual diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients should also be asked to identify and avoid exercises, recreational activities, sexual activities, or body positions that seem to worsen the bladder symptoms. A symptom diary may be useful for some patients to identify such factors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluid management &ndash; A fluid and voiding diary can provide information to guide recommendations for fluid management (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F63359\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63359 \">figure 1</a>); such recommendations should be individualized for each patient. Patients who experience worsening of symptoms with concentrated urine may find increasing fluid intake helpful. Others experience pain with bladder filling and may find that moderate fluid restriction provides some relief. Patients should be instructed to avoid extremes of fluid intake. In most patients, it is not necessary to drink more than 2 L of fluid per day. Those who restrict fluids should strive to maintain a pale yellow color to their urine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bladder training with urge suppression.

At 12 weeks, 45 percent of these patients reported moderate or marked improvement in symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12621840\"><span class=\"h1\">SECOND-LINE THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Second-line treatments for interstitial <span class=\"nowrap\">cystitis/bladder</span> pain syndrome <span class=\"nowrap\">(IC/BPS)</span> may be time consuming, require referral to another clinician, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> be associated with minor adverse effects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12621847\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> exhibit pelvic floor muscle tenderness on examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. For these patients, especially if palpation of the muscles reproduces their pain symptoms, we suggest physical therapy alone or in combination with other treatments. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome#H2089857\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p>The efficacy of this treatment approach was best illustrated in a randomized trial that compared pelvic floor physical therapy with traditional full-body therapeutic massage in women with <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span>. The overall response rate was statistically significantly higher in the physical therapy group (59 versus 29 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. There was no difference in the frequency of adverse events for the two groups. Importantly, this trial was limited to women who demonstrated pelvic floor muscle tenderness on examination; the efficacy of pelvic floor physical therapy in women without muscle tenderness is not known.</p><p>Pelvic physical therapy includes treatment of the pelvic muscle tender points, trigger points, connective tissue restrictions, and muscular abnormalities of the soft tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This type of treatment is provided by a physical therapist with specialized training in pelvic soft tissue manual manipulation and rehabilitation. Physical therapists in the United States who focus on pelvic physical therapy for women can be found through the American Physical Therapy Association. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-floor-physical-therapy-for-management-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic floor physical therapy for management of myofascial pelvic pain syndrome in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H284358\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral medications are typically used initially. If these do not provide relief or are not well tolerated, treatments that require bladder catheterization or cystoscopy are used. There are no comparative studies of oral medications for <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS;</span> the choice of agent depends upon the risk of adverse effects and patient preference. For most patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS,</span> we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a> rather than other medications as the initial oral medication. Treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentosan-polysulfate-sodium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentosan polysulfate</a> sodium (PPS) is reasonable for patients for whom amitriptyline is not effective or causes bothersome adverse effects. For the subset of patients with both <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> and allergic disorders, we suggest an antihistamine as the initial oral medication.</p><p>Antihistamines (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyzine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyzine</a>) can be used at bedtime in patients who complain of insomnia because they void frequently during the night, since the hypnotic effect may be helpful for this subset of patients. Also, in our practice, we use an antihistamine as the first oral agent in patients with other allergic disorders. This approach is based upon the hypothesis that hypersensitivity may be responsible for bladder symptoms (eg, finding of increased mast cells in the bladder wall). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome#H28423492\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>PPS may not result in relief of symptoms for three to six months after initiation of treatment, so patients must be willing to accept a drug trial of at least that duration. Side effects of PPS are typically very mild, so this is a good agent to use if patients are concerned about sedation, which can occur with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a> or antihistamines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12621861\"><span class=\"h3\">Amitriptyline</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amitriptyline</a> is the most widely used agent for initial pharmacologic therapy of <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS,</span> since the effects can be observed soon after therapy. Amitriptyline appears to be most effective at higher doses, but use of these doses is limited by bothersome or dangerous adverse effects. Tricyclic antidepressants are believed to have analgesic properties and also to relieve the depressive symptoms associated with chronic pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain#H9187574\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain&quot;, section on 'Tricyclic antidepressants'</a>.)</p><p>The typical dosing regimen of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a> starts with 10 mg at bedtime, escalating at weekly intervals to 25, 50, and 75 mg (or to the maximum tolerated dose). Adverse effects include anticholinergic effects (eg, dry mouth, urinary retention), sedation, weight gain, orthostatic hypotension, and cardiac conduction abnormalities.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amitriptyline</a> should not be given concomitantly with monoamine oxidase inhibitors, since this may cause serotonin syndrome. It should not be given with cisapride due to increased risks of cardiac arrhythmia, nor should it be used during the acute recovery phase following myocardial infarction. Coadministration with drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 may increase serum levels and result in toxicity and should be avoided (eg, selective serotonin inhibitors, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cimetidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cimetidine</a>, many anticonvulsants). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tricyclic-and-tetracyclic-drugs-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tricyclic and tetracyclic drugs: Pharmacology, administration, and side effects&quot;, section on 'Side effects'</a>.)</p><p>There are conflicting data about the efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a> for <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> treatment. It appears that it is most likely to be effective at higher doses (ie, 50 mg daily), but many patients do not tolerate these doses.

Treatment is not curative and the goal of management is to provide relief of symptoms to achieve an adequate quality of life. (See <a href=\"#H12621791\" class=\"local\">'Clinical approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are many therapeutic approaches for <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> and none are proven to be helpful for all patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span>. <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> is treated with a stepwise approach guided by individual patient characteristics and the risk of adverse effects of each type of treatment. (See <a href=\"#H9280020\" class=\"local\">'Stepwise approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Analgesics may be used in <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> patients at any point in treatment with the goal of minimizing pain and maximizing function. In general, pain medications are used for short-term relief for flares of bladder pain rather than as primary therapy. Their use should be guided by the risk of adverse effects and dependency. In some patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS,</span> as with other chronic pain conditions, long-term use of analgesics may be necessary. (See <a href=\"#H2164226\" class=\"local\">'Use of analgesics'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial measures for all patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> included patient education about the condition, treatment of comorbid conditions (eg, urinary tract infection, other chronic pain conditions), and psychosocial support. (See <a href=\"#H9280724\" class=\"local\">'Initial measures for all patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For these patients who exhibit pelvic floor muscle tenderness on examination, especially if palpation of the muscles reproduces their pain symptoms, we suggest physical therapy alone or in combination with other treatments (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H12621847\" class=\"local\">'Physical therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral medications are typically used initially. If these do not provide relief or are not well tolerated, treatments that require bladder catheterization or cystoscopy are used. (See <a href=\"#H284358\" class=\"local\">'Oral medications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS,</span> we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a> rather than other medications as the initial oral medication (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentosan-polysulfate-sodium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentosan polysulfate</a> sodium (PPS) is reasonable for patients for whom amitriptyline is not effective or causes bothersome adverse effects. For the subset of patients with both <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> and allergic disorders, we suggest an antihistamine as the initial oral medication (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H284358\" class=\"local\">'Oral medications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Third-line therapies for <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> are used for patients who have failed second-line treatments. These approaches require cystoscopy, including bladder hydrodistention and treatment of bladder wall Hunner lesions. (See <a href=\"#H12621896\" class=\"local\">'Third-line therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fourth-line therapies include intradetrusor botulinum toxin A and neuromodulation. These therapies are reserved for patients with symptoms that significantly affect quality of life, who have failed other measures, and who are aware of and willing to accept the risk of adverse effects. These therapies should be administered only by clinicians who have experience with use of these approaches in patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> and with management of the adverse effects that may occur. There are no comparative data to guide the choice between these approaches, and the decision is based upon patient preference after counseling about potential adverse effects. (See <a href=\"#H12621917\" class=\"local\">'Fourth-line therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cyclosporine</a> A (CyA) is a fifth-line therapy supported by scant or low-quality data and has the potential to result in severe adverse effects. CyA should be administered only by clinicians who have experience with its use in patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> and with management of the adverse effects that may occur. (See <a href=\"#H12621931\" class=\"local\">'Fifth-line therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinary diversion is the treatment of last resort for <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span>. It is a surgical procedure that may result in severe perioperative and ongoing morbidity. (See <a href=\"#H12621952\" class=\"local\">'Sixth-line therapy'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Koziol JA.
