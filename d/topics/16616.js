Surgery is challenging, as bladder exstrophy involves the urinary, reproductive, and musculoskeletal systems, and, in some patents, the intestinal tract. Major goals of reconstruction are preservation of normal kidney function, development of adequate bladder storage and function (ie, urinary continence), and provision of acceptable genital cosmetic appearance and function.</p><p>The surgical management and postoperative outcomes of children with bladder exstrophy are discussed here. The clinical manifestations and initial management of infants with bladder exstrophy are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-infants-with-bladder-exstrophy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and initial management of infants with bladder exstrophy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL APPROACHES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following approaches, or variations of such, are used to manage bladder exstrophy. The first two interventions result in correction of the underlying defect.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Modern staged repair of bladder exstrophy (MSRBE) involves three staged operations and was initially developed in the 1970s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-and-postoperative-outcome-of-children-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Subsequent modifications have been made over the past several years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete primary repair of bladder exstrophy (CPRBE) was introduced in 1989 with the hope that a single operation would achieve the goals of continence and preservation of renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-and-postoperative-outcome-of-children-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, follow-up studies demonstrate that many children still require multiple procedures following CPRBE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-and-postoperative-outcome-of-children-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Choice of surgical approach'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinary diversion is the least common of the surgical options and involves creating a functional connection between the urinary and intestinal tracts. Although there are several variations, the basic approach is to divert urine away from the urinary bladder and into the bowel (large <span class=\"nowrap\">intestine/colon)</span> for temporary storage, and then intermittent passage with the stool through the rectum. When successful, passage of urine is under the control of the child. The bladder and urethra are closed but are &quot;dry,&quot; and they are not exposed to or necessary for handling the urine.</p><p/><p>These surgical approaches are based on successful initial bladder closure either at birth or within the first two months of life. Early bladder closure, especially when coupled with epispadias repair (CPRBE), is hypothesized to ensure initiation of bladder cycling in the newborn or young infant. It is thought that this will optimize bladder growth and development, resulting in an increased probability of continence and adequate bladder capacity, which may reduce the need for future bladder augmentation and urinary diversions. Another view is that the initial bladder size is the best indicator of ultimate bladder capacity and function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Modern staged repair of bladder exstrophy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MSRBE consists of three specific components scheduled at the following approximate ages:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Newborn &ndash; Closure of the bladder, posterior urethra, and abdominal wall defect results in the creation of complete (penopubic) epispadias and is performed within the first two months of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-and-postoperative-outcome-of-children-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In the newborn, closure may not be possible because of a stiff bladder &quot;template&quot; or because the bladder is too small if the infant is preterm. In the latter setting, time allows for adequate growth so that closure is feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-and-postoperative-outcome-of-children-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Six months to one year of age &ndash; Epispadias repair is performed. The goal is to fashion a straight and functional penis with a glanular meatus in male patients and an acceptable cosmetic appearance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Four to five years of age &ndash; Bladder neck reconstruction (BNR) and bilateral ureteral reimplantation are performed when there is documented adequate bladder capacity and motivation of the patient to participate in a postoperative voiding program. The goal of this last stage is to provide urinary continence.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Complete primary repair of bladder exstrophy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CPRBE combines bladder closure and epispadias repair (and in some cases ureteral reimplantation) into a single operation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56997\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56997 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54676\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54676 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68809\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68809 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-and-postoperative-outcome-of-children-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/3,8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8-12</a>]. This surgical approach includes wide exposure of the proximal urethra, and the transfer of the posterior urethra, prostate, and bladder neck deep into the pelvis. The goal of CPRBE is to provide early and adequate bladder outlet resistance that promotes growth of the bladder. Similar to the first stage of the MSRBE approach, CPRBE may be performed within the first 72 hours of life, with or without pelvic bone osteotomy, or as a purposely-delayed procedure at approximately two months of age with pelvic osteotomies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F106945\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef106945 \">picture 5</a>). A multi-institutional bladder exstrophy consortium is focused on refining the CPRBE technique, streamlining follow-up care, and optimizing outcome in patients with bladder exstrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-and-postoperative-outcome-of-children-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>In a study based on the Pediatric Health Information System database that identified 381 patients undergoing primary closure within the first 120 days of life from 1999 to 2010, 279 neonates (73 percent) underwent repair within the first three days of life, 67 were repaired between 4 and 30 days of life, and 35 between 31 and 120 days of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-and-postoperative-outcome-of-children-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Approximately one-third of the cohort (n = 119) underwent pelvic osteotomy, including 51 patients who underwent closure within the first three days of life.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H356708205\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial reconstructive surgery may be performed within the first two to three days of life (immediate) or at approximately 6 to 12 weeks of age (delayed). Delayed closure may be preferred by the pediatric urologists based upon their clinical experience or upon the specific anatomy of the individual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-and-postoperative-outcome-of-children-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Examples of the latter include preterm infants in whom the anatomy is too small for safe repair. Another advantage of delaying CPRBE is allowing infant bonding with parents before initial reconstructive surgery and the lengthy recovery period that follows. In addition, the time between birth and initial repair will allow for growth, development, and additional maturation of some organs and systems prior to the complex initial reconstructive surgery and will allow for safer anesthesia and surgery. In our center, the preferred timing for CPRBE is at 6 to 12 weeks of age (ie, delayed closure).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of surgical approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is unclear which surgical approach best meets the goals of preservation of normal kidney function, urinary continence, and provision of an acceptable cosmetic genital appearance and function. A case series of 13 children demonstrated the neurologic safety of the CPRBE technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-and-postoperative-outcome-of-children-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Bladder function (urodynamic) study via simultaneous cystometrography (CMG) and electromyography (EMG) documented normal external urethral sphincter muscle activity, intact sacral reflex responses, and coordinated voiding in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-and-postoperative-outcome-of-children-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In general, the success of surgical management of bladder exstrophy is determined by the rates of urinary continence, the need for additional operation(s) (eg, bladder augmentation), and renal function.</p><p>Data are lacking that directly compare these two approaches based upon these outcome measures, partly because bladder exstrophy is an uncommon anomaly, and because most tertiary centers with the surgical expertise to treat this condition typically choose one approach over the other. The latter factor potentially leads to center and publication bias. In addition, long-term follow-up of patients who undergo CPRBE is limited, as this approach was only introduced in 1989. When CPRBE was initially introduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-and-postoperative-outcome-of-children-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], it had been hoped that this approach would provide continence with a single operation, and eliminate the need for both BNR and augmentation.</p><p>Although long-term follow-up data are limited, evidence suggests that a significant proportion of patients will require BNR following CPRBE:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a review of 46 patients (31 males and 15 females) who were followed after CPRBE from 1994 to 2010 at our tertiary center, BNR was performed in 12 patients who were five years of age or older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-and-postoperative-outcome-of-children-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The need for BNR was greater in males than in females (43 versus 27 percent), and the age of reconstruction was younger in males (6.3 versus 8.1 years of age). In 12 patients, six were continent 1.5 years after BNR.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In case series of 39 children managed by CPRBE from Seattle, 17 of 23 evaluable patients achieved daytime continence, defined as a dry interval greater than two hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-and-postoperative-outcome-of-children-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, 12 of these patients required additional intervention to achieve continence, including BNR with or without bladder neck injection in nine patients, and bladder neck injection alone in three patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study from a tertiary center that generally does not perform CPRBE, 26 of 33 patients who were referred after CPRBE (performed at other institutions) underwent BNR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-and-postoperative-outcome-of-children-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Of the 19 patients who had complications following CPRBE with bladder dehiscence and prolapse, 12 underwent BNR, but only three achieved total continence. Of the 14 patients with successful CPRBE, eight were continent both day and night, four were continent only during the day, and two were incontinent.</p><p/><p>In one series in which MSRBE was performed by a single pediatric urologist, the continence rate following BNR without bladder augmentation was approximately 70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-and-postoperative-outcome-of-children-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Other published rates following MSRBE vary and include patients with bladder augmentation or those who required clean intermittent catheterization. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Continence'</a> below.)</p><p>CPRBE, although not eliminating BNR entirely, appears to reduce the number of patients who will require BNR. It has yet to be determined whether CPRBE results in a similar or even higher rate of continence with a reduced rate of BNR.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Neonatal iliac osteotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The need for iliac osteotomy as part of successful bladder closure in the first few days of life is independent of which surgical approach is selected. In general, bladder closure can be performed within the first 72 hours after birth without osteotomy if there is no extreme diastasis. This is because the pelvic ring is relatively malleable in the first two or three days of life. If the pelvis is not malleable or there is extreme diastasis, osteotomies should be performed to increase the likelihood of successful bladder closure.</p><p>Regardless of whether osteotomy is performed and which surgical approach is chosen, the pelvis is typically immobilized with traction following bladder closure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66430\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66430 \">picture 6</a>). A common form of traction for newborns is modified Bryant's traction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81241\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81241 \">picture 7</a>). This is typically employed for two to four weeks following the initial reconstructive surgical procedure. Other reported alternate options include spica casting and a padded Velcro strap wrap technique, which has been reported to decrease length of stay and enable parents to hold the infant shortly after repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-and-postoperative-outcome-of-children-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p>However, in a British case series, primary bladder closure without osteotomy and postoperative immobilization was successful in 70 of 74 patients (95 percent) in respect to bladder closure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-and-postoperative-outcome-of-children-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. These patients were managed postoperatively by either epidural anesthesia or with temporary paralysis and ventilatory support. These results need to be confirmed at other centers to see if the traditional approach of pelvic immobilization with or without osteotomy should be modified, and outcomes in respect to urinary continence need to be assessed. It should be noted that this approach to management is with initial surgery (first stage of MSRBE), later followed by a radical soft tissue (&quot;Kelly&quot;) procedure that is typically planned for 9 to 12 months of age. The Kelly procedure is not a favored technique in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-and-postoperative-outcome-of-children-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications following surgical correction of bladder exstrophy include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bladder dehiscence &ndash; Bladder dehiscence is a relatively rare complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-and-postoperative-outcome-of-children-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Some experts in the field advocate the routine use of osteotomies to prevent this complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-and-postoperative-outcome-of-children-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Others, including the author, believe that bladder closure can be performed successfully, often without osteotomies, if the procedure is performed within the first 72 hours of life when the pelvic ring is malleable and if there is not extreme diastasis. Bladder dehiscence is associated with an increased risk of incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-and-postoperative-outcome-of-children-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinary tract infections &ndash; Urinary tract infections (UTI) are common in patients with bladder exstrophy. UTIs may include pyelonephritis with the infection affecting either one or both kidneys. This is especially true in patients with bladder augmentation or ileal conduits who have reported incidences of UTI of 63 and 48 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-and-postoperative-outcome-of-children-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is another common finding in patients with bladder exstrophy, and it increases the risk of pyelonephritis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In our series of 32 patients who underwent complete primary repair of bladder exstrophy (CPRBE), nine patients (28 percent) had one to four episodes of pyelonephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-and-postoperative-outcome-of-children-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bladder stone (calculus) &ndash; Formation of a bladder stone may occur due to urinary stasis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> recurrent UTI. Because of increased mucus production and bacterial colonization, stone formation is more common in patients with bladder augmentation, with a reported incidence that ranges from 24 to 72 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-and-postoperative-outcome-of-children-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bladder perforations &ndash; Bladder perforations rarely occur. Patients are at increased risk for this complication following procedures that increase bladder outlet resistance such as bladder neck reconstruction (BNR). This complication may also occur in a patient that has had bladder augmentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-and-postoperative-outcome-of-children-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fistulas &ndash; Urethrocutaneous or vesicocutaneous fistulas (abnormal connection of the urethra or bladder to the skin) are the most commonly reported complications after initial bladder closure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-and-postoperative-outcome-of-children-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The reported fistula rate is approximately 9 percent in patients managed by CPRBE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-and-postoperative-outcome-of-children-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/26,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,31</a>], and between 4 and 16 percent in those managed by modern staged repair of bladder exstrophy (MSRBE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-and-postoperative-outcome-of-children-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. It should be noted that in one of the MSRBE series, all of the patients had spontaneous resolution of their fistulae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-and-postoperative-outcome-of-children-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypospadias &ndash; Hypospadias appears to be a more common result at the initial closure in patients with CPRBE versus those with MSRBE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-and-postoperative-outcome-of-children-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/31,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,34</a>]. In our initial series of patients managed with CPRBE, the rate of hypospadias was 43 percent. However, with modification of the procedure (interrupted suture closure of the urethra at epispadias repair), the rate of hypospadias has been reduced to 5 percent. Of note, repair of hypospadias after CPRBE with a Thiersch-Duplay urethroplasty (a relatively simple urethral tubularization technique) resulted in a high rate of urethrocutaneous fistula, and thus, we do not recommend this technique for hypospadias repair following CPRBE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-and-postoperative-outcome-of-children-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Penile injury &ndash; Ischemic penile injury, typically characterized by hemiglans and hemicorporeal body atrophy, may occur after exstrophy closure combined with epispadias repair (CPRBE), particularly when osteotomy is not performed. Compression of the pudendal vessels after pubic apposition <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> direct injury to the pudendal vessels may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-and-postoperative-outcome-of-children-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Long-term complications</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epididymitis &ndash; Epididymitis is an infrequent long-term complication, with a reported incidence of 19 to 33 percent in adult male patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-and-postoperative-outcome-of-children-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. In some cases, orchiectomy, vasectomy, or an epididymectomy is required for treatment and pain relief.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal and rectal prolapse &ndash; Vaginal and rectal prolapse are also long-term complications that occur in approximately 20 percent of female patients at a mean age of 16 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-and-postoperative-outcome-of-children-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malignancy &ndash; The risk of malignancy appears to be higher in patients with exstrophy than in the general population, especially in a high risk group of patients with bladder augmentation using intestinal components to create a colorectal reservoir (eg, ureterosigmoidostomies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-and-postoperative-outcome-of-children-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].

In the high-risk group of 28 patients, there were seven cases of malignancies (colonic carcinoma [n = 3], bladder cancer [n = 3], and carcinoma in situ of the colon [n = 1]). In the low-risk group of 33 patients, one patient had bladder cancer, and one had renal cell carcinoma.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOME</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Continence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As discussed previously, urinary continence is one of the goals of successful surgical management of bladder exstrophy.

Care for the individual with bladder exstrophy requires life-long care by an experienced and dedicated team of healthcare professionals.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Major goals of surgical correction are preservation of normal kidney function, development of adequate bladder storage and function, and provision of acceptable appearance and function of genitalia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two surgical approaches are currently used to correct bladder exstrophy: modern staged repair of bladder exstrophy (MSRBE), and complete primary repair of bladder exstrophy (CPRBE). Although it is unknown which approach best achieves the goals of surgical outcome, bladder closure in the neonatal period is a major feature of both. In our center, we manage infants with bladder exstrophy with CPRBE. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Surgical approaches'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In all infants with exstrophy, we suggest early closure of the bladder (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This allows initiation of early bladder cycling that optimizes bladder growth and development. In our center, the preferred timing for CPRBE is at 6 to 12 weeks of age. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Surgical approaches'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We do not suggest routine iliac osteotomy if the pelvis is malleable (before 72 hours of life) and there is no extreme diastasis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Osteotomy is performed in patients with extreme diastasis or poorly malleable pelvis. Infants typically require immobilization with traction following bladder closure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73750\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73750 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53828\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53828 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66430\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66430 \">picture 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F106945\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef106945 \">picture 5</a>) regardless of whether an osteotomy is performed. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Neonatal iliac osteotomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications following surgical correction include bladder dehiscence, urinary tract infections (UTI), bladder stones and perforations, fistulas, and hypospadias. Long-term complications include epididymitis in adult males, vaginal and rectal prolapse in female patients, and an increased risk of malignancy, especially in patients with bladder augmentation using intestinal components. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bladder continence continues to be one of the major outcome goals following surgery. Reasonable continence levels appear to be achievable following bladder neck reconstruction (BNR) in patients managed by MSRBE. It appears that a significant number of patients with CPRBE will also require BNR to achieve continence. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Continence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because postpubertal patients with bladder exstrophy often have psychological problems that include poor body image, dissatisfaction with their genital appearance, anxiety, depression, and adjustment disorder, management should include psychological evaluation and, if needed, psychological support and referral. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Psychological outcome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sexual function appears to be adequate in both postpubertal male and female patients with bladder exstrophy. Although data are limited, it does not appear that fertility is an issue for affected females. However, decreased fertility may be a concern in male patients. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Sexual function and fertility'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with bladder exstrophy are capable of achieving satisfactory professional, educational, and social outcomes.
