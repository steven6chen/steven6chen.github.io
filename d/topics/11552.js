A neck fracture is when a person breaks one of the bones in the neck. The medical term for the bones in the neck is &quot;cervical vertebrae&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F72120\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72120 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>There are different types of neck fractures, depending on which bone breaks and how it breaks.</p><p>Some neck fractures are much more serious than others. In a serious neck fracture, the bundle of nerves that runs down the back (called the spinal cord) can also be damaged. This can lead to paralysis. Paralysis is when people are unable to move certain muscles or parts of their body.</p><p>Because a serious neck fracture can lead to paralysis, people with a possible neck fracture should lie still and not move (or be moved) after an injury. They should wait for emergency workers, who can bring them safely to the hospital. Otherwise, if people with a possible neck fracture move (or are moved), it could make their neck fracture and spinal cord damage much worse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H865629800\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a neck fracture?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of a neck fracture can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neck pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neck muscle tightness or spasm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being unable to move the neck or turn the head</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weakness or paralysis in the arms or legs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Numbness or tingling in the arms or legs</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H865629815\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for a neck fracture?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms and do an exam. He or she will also order an imaging test, such as an X-ray or CT scan, which creates pictures of the inside of the body. If the doctor suspects you could have spinal cord damage, he or she might also order another imaging test called an MRI.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H865629830\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a neck fracture treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on the type of neck fracture a person has, how serious it is, and whether it also causes paralysis.</p><p>People with a severe neck fracture or paralysis are treated in the hospital. There, the doctor can monitor them and treat their medical problems. For example, some people might need a breathing tube to help with breathing or medicines to help reduce swelling in the spinal cord.</p><p>A severe neck fracture is treated with surgery. During surgery, the doctor will put the neck bones back in the correct position. He or she will attach (fuse) the bones to each other so they stay in place.</p><p>Neck fractures that are not as serious are usually treated with a special neck collar or brace to hold the neck in place so it can't move. People need to wear the collar or brace until their fracture heals.</p><p>Treatment for a neck fracture also includes medicine to treat the pain. Doctors can prescribe a strong pain medicine if people have a lot of pain or a severe fracture. For mild fractures, doctors usually recommend that people take an over-the-counter pain medicine. Over-the-counter medicines include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve).</p><p>After your fracture heals, you might need to work with a physical therapist (exercise expert). He or she will teach you exercises to strengthen your neck muscles and help your neck move more easily.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H865629862\"><span class=\"h1\">How long does a neck fracture take to heal?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A neck fracture usually takes months to heal, depending on the fracture.</p><p>Healing time also depends on the person. Healthy children usually heal much more quickly than older adults or adults with other medical problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H865629877\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I do anything to improve the healing process?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. It's important to follow all of your doctor's instructions while your fracture is healing. Plus, doctors usually recommend that people with a fracture:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat a healthy diet that includes enough calcium, vitamin D, and protein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79375\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79375 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop smoking. A fracture can take longer to heal if you smoke.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H865629915\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call my doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment, your doctor or nurse will tell you when to call him or her. In general, you should call if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have trouble moving your arms or legs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have no feeling in your arms or legs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have trouble controlling your bladder or bowels</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have problems with your neck brace, such as fluid draining from around the screws or sores where the brace presses on your skin</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H865629930\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=neck-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Neck pain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fractures-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Fractures (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=paraplegia-and-quadriplegia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Paraplegia and quadriplegia (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=giving-your-child-over-the-counter-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Giving your child over-the-counter medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=advance-directives-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Advance directives (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=neck-pain-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Neck pain (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
