Vaginal discharge is made up of cells from the vagina and cervix, bacteria, mucus, and water.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1664912504\"><span class=\"h1\">Can vaginal discharge be normal?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Normally, women who get monthly periods can have a small amount of vaginal discharge each day. Normal vaginal discharge can be white, clear, or thick, but usually does not smell bad.</p><p>Different women can have different amounts of vaginal discharge. Also, a woman can have more or less vaginal discharge at different times. For example, a woman might notice more vaginal discharge:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When she is pregnant</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When she uses hormone birth control medicines</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the 2 weeks before she gets her period</p><p/><p>Women who have been through menopause usually have less vaginal discharge. Menopause is the time when a woman stops getting her monthly period.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1664912511\"><span class=\"h1\">When is vaginal discharge abnormal?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaginal discharge is abnormal when it occurs with the following symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Itching of the vagina or the area around the vagina</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Redness, pain, or swelling around the vagina</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discharge that is foamy, greenish-yellow, or has blood in it</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discharge that smells bad</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain when urinating or having sex</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the lower part of the belly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1664912518\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the causes of abnormal vaginal discharge?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different conditions can cause abnormal vaginal discharge. The most common causes are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An infection in the vagina</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A reaction to something in the vagina that a woman forgot to take out, such as a tampon or condom</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A reaction to a soap or other product that was in the vagina</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in the body that occur after menopause</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1664912525\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I treat abnormal vaginal discharge myself?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. Most doctors recommend that you do not treat abnormal vaginal discharge yourself. Treating yourself can cause your symptoms to get worse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1664912532\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you have abnormal vaginal discharge, see a doctor or nurse so that he or she can figure out the cause. Your doctor or nurse will talk with you and do an exam. He or she will also take a sample of your vaginal discharge, and do lab tests on the sample to look for an infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1664912539\"><span class=\"h1\">How is abnormal vaginal discharge treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment will depend on the cause of the abnormal vaginal discharge. For example, different vaginal infections are treated with different medicines. If you have a vaginal infection, your doctor or nurse will want to figure out what type of infection you have so that he or she can treat it with the right medicine.</p><p>If your abnormal vaginal discharge is caused by certain types of infections, your sex partner will also need to see a doctor for treatment. (You might want to stop having sex until you know what is causing your symptoms.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1664912546\"><span class=\"h1\">Can abnormal vaginal discharge be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sometimes.
