These defects can be caused by genetic abnormalities <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> environmental exposures, although the underlying etiology is often unknown. Birth defects can be isolated or present in a characteristic combination or pattern that may affect one or more organ systems. This topic discusses the epidemiology, types, and patterns of birth defects. Causes and evaluation of birth defects are discussed in detail separately, as are specific congenital anomalies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=birth-defects-causes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Birth defects: Causes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=birth-defects-approach-to-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Birth defects: Approach to evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4150520996\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Major congenital malformations are abnormalities that have medical, surgical, or cosmetic significance (see <a href=\"#H3259849168\" class=\"local\">'Major'</a> below). They occur in approximately 2 to 4 percent of livebirths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-epidemiology-types-and-patterns/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>] and are more common in stillborn spontaneous miscarriages.</p><p>The overall prevalence of most major birth defects does not vary much across ethnic groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-epidemiology-types-and-patterns/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. However, the risk for different types of malformations is variable and may be related to genetic susceptibilities, as well as cultural and social differences that can influence exposures (eg, increased presence of neural tube defects in populations that have dietary deficiency of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">folic acid</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-epidemiology-types-and-patterns/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. The prevalence of most major birth defects has remained constant, although some have shown a significant increase such as gastroschisis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-epidemiology-types-and-patterns/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Minor anomalies (see <a href=\"#H1255242320\" class=\"local\">'Minor'</a> below) are seen more frequently than major malformations.</p><p>Disruptions are vascular defects that result from destruction of or interference with normal development. The prevalence of disruptions (see <a href=\"#H3640364790\" class=\"local\">'Disruptions'</a> below) is dependent upon the type of anomaly but can range from 0.5 to 4 per 10,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-epidemiology-types-and-patterns/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Deformations (see <a href=\"#H3282666919\" class=\"local\">'Deformations'</a> below) are the result of modification of normal structures, are more common in the limbs and head, and are seen in approximately 3 percent of newborns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-epidemiology-types-and-patterns/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4260699423\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES AND PATTERNS OF DEFECTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific terms are used to describe congenital abnormalities. These terms indicate the cause of the anomalies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57394\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57394 \">table 1</a>). Other terms are used to describe specific patterns of malformations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4131797223\"><span class=\"h2\">Malformations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Malformations are defects of organs or body parts due to an intrinsically abnormal developmental process. In this process, a structure is not formed, is partially formed, or is formed in an abnormal fashion.</p><p>Malformations often result from a defect in embryonic development. Thus, most occur prior to the eighth week after conception. However, malformations can also occur in body structures that develop or continue to develop after this time, such as the central nervous system (CNS), external and internal genitalia, and teeth.</p><p>Malformations can result from genetic or teratogenic environmental factors. An example of a genetic cause is mutations in <em>HOXD13</em>, a homeobox gene, that cause a combination of syndactyly and polydactyly (synpolydactyly) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-epidemiology-types-and-patterns/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. An example of an environmental cause is exposure to retinoic acid, which can cause anomalies such as microtia (underdeveloped external ear [pinna]) and CNS defects including polymicrogyria and hydrocephalus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-epidemiology-types-and-patterns/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Malformations of unknown etiology are probably due to monogenic conditions that have not yet been identified, somatic mutations arising at an early stage in development, combinations of genetic factors, or multifactorial disorders that result from the interaction of multiple genes and environmental factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3259849168\"><span class=\"h3\">Major</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Malformations can be classified as major and minor. Major malformations are those that have medical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> social implications. These often require surgical repair or are life threatening. The neural tube defects, such as meningomyelocele or orofacial clefting (cleft lip and palate), are examples of common major malformations, and other are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82547\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82547 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of myelomeningocele (spina bifida)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=facial-clefts-and-holoprosencephaly\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Facial clefts and holoprosencephaly&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The prevalence of major malformations ranges from 2 to 4 percent, depending upon the population surveyed (eg, newborns versus children since the prevalence increases after the newborn period) and the method of ascertainment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-epidemiology-types-and-patterns/abstract/1-3,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,14</a>]. In a report from the Mainz congenital birth defect monitoring system in Germany, standardized physical and sonographic examinations were performed in 30,940 liveborn infants, stillborn infants, and abortions from 1990 to 1998 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-epidemiology-types-and-patterns/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Major malformations were identified in 2144 (6.9 percent), highlighting the higher incidence of major malformations in the prenatal setting and in stillbirths.</p><p>Diverse molecular mechanisms lead to major malformations. The defects may interfere with many normal processes, such as apoptosis (cell death), migration of neural cell crest derivatives, intracellular signaling, and chromatin remodeling.</p><p>The following are examples of genes and proteins involved in specific malformations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Homeobox genes &ndash; Synpolydactyly (combinations of syndactyly and polydactyly), microphthalmia, holoprosencephaly</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transcription factors &ndash; Conotruncal heart defects in DiGeorge syndrome (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;DiGeorge (22q11.2 deletion) syndrome: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;</a>), campomelic dysplasia (a rare skeletal dysplasia caused by mutations in SRY-box 9 [<em>SOX9</em>])</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fibroblast growth factor receptors &ndash; Craniosynostoses, such as Pfeiffer syndrome, Crouzon syndrome, and Apert syndrome (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=craniosynostosis-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Craniosynostosis syndromes&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enzyme defects &ndash; Defects in cholesterol biosynthesis in Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1255242320\"><span class=\"h3\">Minor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Minor malformations have mostly cosmetic significance. They rarely are medically significant or require surgical intervention. They represent part of the normal variation in the general population. Examples of minor anomalies include ear tags, clinodactyly (incurving of the fifth finger) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54831\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54831 \">picture 1</a>), and single transverse palmar creases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78729\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78729 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>Minor anomalies are common, although estimates of their prevalence vary with the population studied and the method of ascertainment. In the Mainz congenital birth defect monitoring survey noted above, mild errors of morphogenesis were diagnosed in 11,104 of 30,940 infants (35.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-epidemiology-types-and-patterns/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In a study from 1964 limited to examination of newborn infants, 14 percent had a single minor anomaly. Two and three or more minor malformations occurred in 0.8 and 0.5 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-epidemiology-types-and-patterns/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Approximately 50 percent of minor anomalies are located in the head and neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-epidemiology-types-and-patterns/abstract/2,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,16</a>].</p><p>Infants with three or more minor anomalies are at increased risk of having a major defect or syndrome. In two reports, a major malformation was present in 26 and 19.6 percent of infants with three or more minor anomalies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-epidemiology-types-and-patterns/abstract/2,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3347805237\"><span class=\"h3\">Patterns</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple malformations are often grouped in a recognizable pattern (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75281\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75281 \">table 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3710129982\"><span class=\"h4\">Syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A syndrome is a pattern of anomalies that occur together and are associated with a set number of signs and symptoms.</p><p>Syndromes with a known cause include Turner syndrome due to monosomy of the X chromosome. Patients with this disorder typically have short stature, neck webbing, shield-like chest, underdevelopment of the secondary sexual characteristics, and infertility. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Turner syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Syndromes with no known genetic basis include Aicardi syndrome, for example. This is an X-linked, dominant disorder characterized by a classical triad that includes agenesis of the corpus callosum, chorioretinal lacunae, and seizures. It is seen in females and is lethal in males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-epidemiology-types-and-patterns/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. While this syndrome is known to be X linked, the exact genetic defect is unknown.</p><p>Some syndromes are inherited, such as Marfan syndrome or achondroplasia. Other congenital malformation syndromes appear sporadic, despite having an underlying genetic etiology, because they are reproductively lethal, and so the condition is not passed on to offspring. These conditions often arise as a result of a de novo mutation in a dominant gene and generally have a very low recurrence risk (approximately 1 percent). An example is Cornelia de Lange syndrome (also called Brachman de Lange syndrome), which is characterized by severe growth retardation, microcephaly, limb anomalies, distinctive dysmorphic features, and profound intellectual disability (mental retardation). Cornelia de Lange syndrome is caused by mutations of the nipped-B-like (<em>NIPBL</em>) gene in approximately 50 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-epidemiology-types-and-patterns/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. It is less commonly caused by mutations in other genes, including structural maintenance of chromosomes 1A (<em>SMC1A</em>), histone deacetylase 8 (<em>HDAC8</em>), RAD21 cohesin complex component (<em>RAD21</em>), and structural maintenance of chromosome 3 (<em>SMC3</em>). There are some reported familial cases of this syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H749548785\"><span class=\"h4\">Sequence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A sequence is a pattern of anomalies in which a single known defect in development causes a cascade of subsequent abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-epidemiology-types-and-patterns/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Potter sequence is an example of this group of disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-epidemiology-types-and-patterns/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. This disorder is caused by oligohydramnios secondary to renal agenesis or other renal anomalies that reduce fetal urine output production. The decreased volume of amniotic fluid restricts fetal movements, resulting in characteristic anomalies. These include flat facies, depression of the nasal tip, abnormal ear folding, wrinkled skin, and malposition of the feet, including clubfoot deformities. Pulmonary hypoplasia is often associated with the external deformities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal agenesis: Prenatal diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Another example is Prune-belly sequence, in which patients have severe abdominal defects due to lack of the major abdominal muscles. This disorder occurs in male fetuses when urethral malformations or obstruction leads to a distended bladder that interferes with timely closure of the abdominal wall.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3701878865\"><span class=\"h4\">Developmental field defect</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A field defect is a pattern of anomalies caused by disturbance of a region of the embryo that develops in a contiguous physical space. This region is known as a developmental field [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-epidemiology-types-and-patterns/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Holoprosencephaly is a classic example of a developmental field defect. The clinical manifestations are variable. They range from very severe cases with almost absent forebrain to milder manifestations, such as a single central incisor. Although there are many etiologies for holoprosencephaly, the primary defect is the lack of normal induction by the prechordal mesoderm on the forebrain, resulting in abnormal cleavage of the embryonic forebrain. Craniofacial structures also are affected because the embryonic forebrain in turn influences mesoderm developmental processes on the mid-face. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=facial-clefts-and-holoprosencephaly\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Facial clefts and holoprosencephaly&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Bladder exstrophy and cloacal exstrophy represent another developmental field defect. These conditions include urinary, genital, gastrointestinal, and orthopedic abnormalities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-infants-with-bladder-exstrophy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and initial management of infants with bladder exstrophy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3788531324\"><span class=\"h4\">Association</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An association is defined as two or more anomalies that are not pathogenetically related and occur together more frequently than expected by chance. In general, the etiology of associations is not defined. It is possible that some represent developmental field defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-epidemiology-types-and-patterns/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Examples of this pattern include the VATER or VACTERL association. These are acronyms for a group of typical associated anomalies. VACTERL association includes <strong>V</strong>ertebral anomalies, <strong>A</strong>nal atresia, <strong>C</strong>ardiac defects, <strong>TE</strong> fistula (tracheoesophageal fistula), <strong>R</strong>enal defects, and <strong>L</strong>imb defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-epidemiology-types-and-patterns/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. A few patients also have Fanconi anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-epidemiology-types-and-patterns/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Because anomalies in these associations tend to occur together more frequently, the finding of one abnormality should prompt the clinician to look for related anomalies. As an example, a child born with an imperforate anus should be evaluated for vertebral and renal anomalies that occur together in VACTERL association. In addition, patients with VACTERL association that have radial ray defects should have chromosomal breakage studies to screen for Fanconi anemia since the presence of that disorder has management implications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-epidemiology-types-and-patterns/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. For a more precise diagnosis of Fanconi anemia, exome sequencing or specific panels are used as there are over a dozen of genes that can cause Fanconi anemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inherited-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inherited aplastic anemia in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3282666919\"><span class=\"h2\">Deformations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Deformations are abnormalities of the position of body parts due to extrinsic intrauterine mechanical forces that modify a normally formed structure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-epidemiology-types-and-patterns/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Intrauterine forces, such as decreased amniotic fluid, uterine tumors, and uterine malformations (eg, bicornuate or septated uterus) can lead to fetal compression. Deformations can also occur with fetal crowding due to multiple gestations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-complications-outcome-and-management-of-multiple-births\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal complications, outcome, and management of multiple births&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Examples of common deformations include some cases of clubfoot, congenital dysplasia of the hip, and positional plagiocephaly (lopsided or flattened skull due to compression). These often can be corrected by physical therapy, casting, or the use of a special helmet to remodel the skull while the fontanelles are still open. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-craniosynostosis#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of craniosynostosis&quot;, section on 'Positional flattening (positional plagiocephaly)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-diagnosis-of-talipes-equinovarus-clubfoot#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal diagnosis of talipes equinovarus (clubfoot)&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3640364790\"><span class=\"h2\">Disruptions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Disruptions are defects of organs or body parts that result from destruction of or interference with normal development. Destruction can result from vascular or mechanical processes that lead to tissue compromise, such as compression, strangulation, hemorrhage, or thrombosis. Most cases of disruption are single events that are sporadic rather than inherited. Thus, their recurrence risk is very low.</p><p>One of the most common examples of intrauterine disruption is the amniotic band sequence (ABS). ABS is a group of structural abnormalities that involve mostly the limbs but also may affect the craniofacial region and trunk. ABS occurs in association with amniotic bands, but the mechanism of amniotic band formation and the pathogenesis of ABS are not firmly established. The specific malformations caused depend upon the time of the disruption. The typical appearance consists of amputations and malformations caused by the encircling constrictions of the limbs or other body structures, but the clinical spectrum is highly variable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amniotic-band-sequence\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Amniotic band sequence&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1588807435\"><span class=\"h2\">Dysplasias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dysplasias refer to anomalies that result from the abnormal organization of cells into tissues. An example is abnormal growth of bone resulting in skeletal dysplasias, such as achondroplasia. This disorder is caused by mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene, leading to abnormalities in endochondral ossification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-epidemiology-types-and-patterns/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].
