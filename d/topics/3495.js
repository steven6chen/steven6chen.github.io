CPD offers several advantages over hemodialysis (HD) that are beneficial for children; however, there are clinical settings in which CPD is contraindicated or may not be the best dialytic modality. In addition, although the principles of CPD are the same for pediatric and adult patients, there are aspects of CPD that are unique to children and infants, which need to be addressed to ensure the adequacy of dialysis and to reduce complications for the pediatric patient.</p><p>The various aspects of chronic peritoneal dialysis in children will be reviewed here. Overview of renal replacement therapy (RRT) in children and hemodialysis for children with chronic kidney disease are presented separately.

While the majority of pediatric patients with ESRD who require dialysis can be managed with CPD, the choice of dialysis modality is most often based on patient and family preference, center philosophy, and availability of the desired modality.</p><p>The quality of life for both patient and family assumes great importance in the selection of home dialysis therapy as a result of the &quot;burden of care&quot; associated with this approach to ESRD management. As such, careful evaluation of the family's social, psychological, and economic background, ideally by a multiprofessional team including the family clinician and nephrologist, dialysis nurse, psychologist, and social worker, is mandatory if a fully informed decision regarding modality selection is to be made [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-peritoneal-dialysis-in-children/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>Although both HD and CPD are effective in solute and fluid removal, CPD offers the following advantages over HD in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-peritoneal-dialysis-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less restricted diet including fluid intake because CPD is performed daily.

These choices are based on the child's age, body size, residual renal function, associated nonrenal diseases, nutritional status, and transport characteristics of the peritoneal membrane, as well as the social, educational, and economic status of the family.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21423824\"><span class=\"h2\">Pediatric versus adult PD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific issues for children undergoing chronic PD that differ from the adult patient include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fill volume</strong> is based on the body surface area (BSA) of the child (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-body-surface-area-mosteller-square-root-method\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H170769281\" class=\"local\">'Fill volume'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Peritoneal equilibration test (PET)</strong> &ndash; PET is used to evaluate the peritoneal membrane function (see <a href=\"#H15616710\" class=\"local\">'Peritoneal membrane function'</a> below). When performing this test, instead of the standard 2 L fill volume used for PET in adults, a test volume of 1100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/m<sup>2</sup></span> based on the patient's BSA is typically used in children. However, infants and young children (below two years of age) may not tolerate a test volume of 1100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/m<sup>2</sup></span>. In these patients, the test volume generally used is the clinically prescribed fill volume. (See <a href=\"#H15616710\" class=\"local\">'Peritoneal membrane function'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>PD catheter size and placement</strong> &ndash; Size of PD catheter will vary based on size of the child. In addition, attention to location of PD catheter exit site is important in infants still wearing diapers as well as in patients who have a gastrostomy tube. (See <a href=\"#H170770118\" class=\"local\">'PD catheter'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H170768844\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of modality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For both children and adults, PD modalities are divided into manual and automated options:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Automated peritoneal dialysis (APD)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H170768851\"><span class=\"h3\">Continuous ambulatory PD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) provides continuous solute and fluid removal throughout the day and night. In this manual form of CPD, the patient or caregiver attaches and instills a bag of sterile dialysis fluid into the peritoneal cavity four times per day through a surgically placed catheter, followed by drainage through the same catheter after a predetermined period of time (referred to as the dwell time). The filling and draining of fluid constitutes an exchange. Each of the three daytime exchanges lasts approximately five hours, and the nighttime exchange nine hours. The advantages of CAPD are its ease of use and the limited cost of equipment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H170768858\"><span class=\"h3\">Automated PD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) is broadly defined as all forms of PD that employ the use of a cycler [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-peritoneal-dialysis-in-children/abstract/5,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,10</a>]. If it is available and there are no financial constraints, APD is the preferred modality for pediatric patients because it allows for a wide range of treatment options, which is more easily tailored than CAPD to the individual needs of the child. In addition, the risk of peritonitis is less in patients receiving APD as compared with CAPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-peritoneal-dialysis-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>In general, multiple automated exchanges are performed at night while the patient is sleeping. The supine position is superior to the upright position for solute and fluid transport because there is better tolerance of large fill volumes, which increases the contact area of the peritoneal membrane and dialysate.</p><p>There are currently three APD options that include multiple nocturnal exchanges:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nightly intermittent PD (NIPD) &ndash; In NIPD, there are a number of short automated nocturnal exchanges, but no dialysis exchange during the day. Thus, solute and fluid removal only take place at night.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Advantages of a dry peritoneal cavity during the day include normal intraperitoneal pressure (IPP) and a decreased risk for hernia formation, reduction of glucose absorption from dialysate, reduction of amino acid and protein loss, and reduction of peritoneal membrane exposure to glucose. In addition, the absence of fluid in the peritoneal cavity might result in improved appetite. (See <a href=\"#H15616800\" class=\"local\">'Increased intraperitoneal pressure-related complications'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The absence of a daytime dwell limits solute clearance; thus, NIPD is generally not a suitable choice in patients with little or no residual renal function (RRF).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) &ndash; In CCPD, automated nocturnal exchanges are followed by a prolonged daytime exchange (dialysis solution volume of 50 to 100 percent of the nocturnal volume), applied at the conclusion of the nocturnal APD session and left in the peritoneal cavity until the start of the next nocturnal dialysis session.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>CCPD provides continuous solute and fluid removal throughout the day and night.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>CCPD is recommended when RRF becomes negligible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tidal peritoneal dialysis (TPD) &ndash; In TPD, an initial infusion of dialysis solution into the peritoneal cavity is followed by only partial drainage of the peritoneal volume during each exchange. As a result, an intraabdominal volume of dialysate is retained at the end of each exchange, so there is constant contact between dialysis solution and the peritoneal membrane.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Partial drain volume is replaced by fresh dialysate to restore the initial fill volume with each cycle. The entire dialysate volume is drained at the end of the session.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>TPD provides continuous solute and fluid removal throughout the day and night.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>It is commonly used for patients with mechanical (eg, drainage of dialysate) problems and as a means of alleviating discomfort in patients experiencing drainage pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-peritoneal-dialysis-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H15616785\" class=\"local\">'Noninfectious complications'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The tidal drain volume can be adapted to the drainage profile of the patient to increase dialysis efficiency. The rate of outflow is not linear and is highest at the beginning of the drain time and then significantly drops to a breakpoint when a critical intraperitoneal volume is reached. Elimination of the time at this breakpoint necessary for complete drainage decreases the time period when solute clearance is greatly reduced.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>TPD requires more dialysate solution and is technically more difficult to perform than CCPD or NIPD.</p><p/><p>APD is performed through a specific pediatric mode of the cycler, which has been adapted for use in infants, children, and adolescents. In small children and infants, this allows for more accurate delivery of small dialysate volumes. As a result of technological advancements, software computer programs can record adherence to the dialysis prescription, delivered dialysis volume, the amount of fluid removed (eg, ultrafiltrate), and the drainage profile of each exchange. This information can be downloaded from the memory card of the cycler or be retrieved via a modem on a regular basis and is used to improve and update the PD prescription [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-peritoneal-dialysis-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Adapted PD, a new variation of automated PD, is characterized by sequential short- and longer-dwell exchanges with small and large dwell volumes designed to enhance volume and solute removal, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-peritoneal-dialysis-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. It still requires further study in children to determine effectiveness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H170770118\"><span class=\"h2\">PD catheter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Successful CPD is dependent on the placement of a reliable access. A two-cuffed Tenckhoff catheter is preferred because use of double cuff versus single cuff catheters is associated with a lower incidence of peritonitis and access revisions, and a longer time to first peritonitis episode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-peritoneal-dialysis-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement and maintenance of the peritoneal dialysis catheter&quot;, section on 'Abdominal catheter'</a>.)</p><p>Catheters should be surgically placed in a paramedian or lateral abdominal location. The deep cuff is placed in or below the rectus muscle, and the superficial cuff is located approximately 2 cm below the skin surface. The catheter should be placed with a lateral or downward-facing exit site position to reduce the risk of peritonitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-peritoneal-dialysis-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Other considerations include placement of the exit site away from a (or potential) gastrostomy site, and outside the diaper area in infants and small children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15616710\"><span class=\"h2\">Peritoneal membrane function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The transport capacity of a patient's peritoneal membrane is one of the most important characteristics to consider when determining the dialysis prescription. The most widely used test of peritoneal membrane function is the peritoneal equilibration test (PET), which assesses the overall solute transport rates across the peritoneum. It categorizes patients based on their solute transport rates and serves as the basis for the patient's dialysis prescription. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peritoneal-equilibration-test\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peritoneal equilibration test&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In children, this standardized test measures small solute transport across the peritoneal membrane and net ultrafiltration during a four-hour dwell using a fill volume of 1100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/m<sup>2</sup></span> BSA of a 2.5 percent dextrose-containing dialysate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-peritoneal-dialysis-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. It is important to recognize that the test fill volume significantly impacts the PET results (eg, small volume associated with high measured solute transport capacity). Several studies have validated this test volume for the PET and have shown consistent results that are similar to the results in adults using the standard test fill volume of 2 L [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-peritoneal-dialysis-in-children/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. Using the BSA-adjusted test volume, there appears to be no difference in the peritoneal membrane transport characteristics between children and adults.</p><p>Infants and young children (below two years of age), however, may not tolerate a test volume of 1100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/m<sup>2</sup></span>. In these patients, the test volume generally used is the clinically prescribed fill volume. (See <a href=\"#H170769281\" class=\"local\">'Fill volume'</a> below.)</p><p>PET is used clinically as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initiation of dialysis to determine the dialysis prescription &ndash; A PET evaluation is conducted four to eight weeks following the initiation of CPD, with subsequent evaluation and possible modification of the initial PD prescription.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitor membrane function &ndash; Because of changes in the peritoneal membrane function that may occur, the PET is used to monitor membrane function and help guide changes in the dialysis prescription. PET should be repeated when there is concern for membrane injury or changes (eg, following repeated episodes of peritonitis) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> clinical evidence of altered transport characteristics (eg, fluid retention with increased blood pressure or worsening symptoms of uremia).</p><p/><p>The clinical applications of the PET are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peritoneal-equilibration-test#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peritoneal equilibration test&quot;, section on 'Clinical applications'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15616717\"><span class=\"h2\">Prescription components</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following are the elements of the peritoneal prescription after selecting the CPD modality:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Selection of PD solutions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determination of the fill volume</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determination of dwell time and number of exchanges</p><p/><p>The prescription is based on the individual patient needs for solute transfer and removal of fluid, both of which can be increased by changes in the prescription, such as increasing the osmolality of the PD solution, fill volume, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> number of exchanges.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H170769273\"><span class=\"h3\">Solutions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several different solutions are available commercially for peritoneal dialysis and all include the following components:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Water</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Buffers to control acidosis (eg, acetate, lactate, or bicarbonate)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrolytes (ie, sodium, calcium, chloride, and magnesium)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osmotic agent; usually dextrose in varying concentrations (1.5, 2.5, and 4.25 percent solutions). Increasing the osmolality will increase net fluid removal.</p><p/><p>Although these solutions satisfactorily remove fluid and transfer solutes, and generally maintain adequate electrolyte, acid-base, and mineral homeostasis, there is increasing evidence that prolonged exposure to standard PD solutions results in membrane injury and reduced function, especially in patients who are exposed to the frequent short cycles used in APD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-peritoneal-dialysis-in-children/abstract/5,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,10</a>]. In particular, solutions with high concentrations of glucose and lactate appear to be more injurious.</p><p>Therefore, development of more biocompatible solutions is desirable, especially for pediatric patients in whom preserving a functional membrane is important so that CPD can be maintained as a long-term dialysis modality. Amino acids and bicarbonate have been used to improve biocompatibility. A multicenter randomized controlled trial showed that a bicarbonate-based buffer improved long-term preservation of peritoneal membrane function compared with lactate-based PD fluids in children on automated PD, while still achieving equal control of acidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-peritoneal-dialysis-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In addition, higher molecular weight glucose polymers, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=icodextrin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">icodextrin</a>, can be used during the long dwell (during the night for patients on CAPD and during the day for patients on APD) to enhance ultrafiltration in patients with high peritoneal membrane transport capacity. Further studies in children are warranted to see if these strategies improve long-term peritoneal membrane function without significant adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-peritoneal-dialysis-in-children/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p>The use of these biocompatible solutions is limited, however, as these solutions are not available in many parts of the world. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peritoneal-dialysis-solutions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peritoneal dialysis solutions&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H170769281\"><span class=\"h3\">Fill volume</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, an important difference in prescribing CPD for children compared with adults is that the prescribed fill volume is based on the BSA of the child. It is adjusted based on the patient's tolerance and need for solute and fluid removal. (See <a href=\"#H21423824\" class=\"local\">'Pediatric versus adult PD'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a CAPD regimen of four exchanges per day, a fill volume of 900 to 1100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/m<sup>2</sup></span> BSA (35 to 45 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg)</span> of 2.5 percent dextrose dialysis solution generally yields net fluid removal (ultrafiltration [UF]) volumes of up to 1100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/m<sup>2</sup></span> with acceptable biochemical control. In patients who still have substantial residual renal function, dialysis solutions of 1.5 percent dextrose may provide acceptable ultrafiltration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients managed by APD, targeted individual nocturnal fill volume is 1000 to 1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/m<sup>2</sup></span> for patients &gt;2 years, and 600 to 800 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/m<sup>2</span> </sup>for children &le;2 years of age. The daytime fill volume is generally 50 percent of the nighttime volume. The UF using this modality is dependent on cycle frequency, fill volume, osmolality of the dialysis solution, and the transport capacity of the child's peritoneal membrane.</p><p/><p>Too small a fill volume may lead to rapid solute equilibration and inadequate ultrafiltration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-peritoneal-dialysis-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In contrast, too large a volume can lead to excessive increases in intraperitoneal pressure (IPP) that reduces dialysis efficiency due to enhanced lymphatic uptake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-peritoneal-dialysis-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In addition, large fill volumes may not be well tolerated by the child due to <span class=\"nowrap\">discomfort/pain,</span> dyspnea, hernia, gastroesophageal reflux, and hydrothorax. In these cases, the IPP measurement may be useful in assessing patient tolerance. In general, an IPP greater than 18 cm H<sub>2</sub>0 is associated with abdominal pain and a decrease in vital capacity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-peritoneal-dialysis-in-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=society-guideline-links-chronic-kidney-disease-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_society_guidelines\">&quot;Society guideline links: Chronic kidney disease in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H263453553\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD) is the most common dialysis treatment modality used to treat pediatric patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), particularly in children less than five years of age.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no comparative studies of chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD) and hemodialysis (HD) outcomes in children with ESRD to suggest superiority of one procedure versus the other. Advantages associated with CPD include a less restricted diet, ability to perform dialysis treatments at home, and no need for vascular access and repeated venipuncture. Disadvantages of CPD include increased caregiver burden and risks of potential nonadherence, and CPD related infections. Contraindications to CPD include specific conditions that affect the integrity of the abdominal cavity and peritoneum. (See <a href=\"#H3926445\" class=\"local\">'Peritoneal dialysis versus hemodialysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Selection of the CPD modality and the specific prescription should ideally be tailored to the needs of the individual patient, with consideration of the medical needs of the child and the quality of life of the patient and family. These choices are based on the child's age, body size, associated nonrenal diseases, nutritional status, and transport characteristics of the peritoneal membrane, as well as the social, educational, and economic status of the family. (See <a href=\"#H15616702\" class=\"local\">'Prescribing peritoneal dialysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CPD modalities are divided into manual and automated options:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD) is the manual form of CPD that provides continuous solute and fluid removal throughout the day and night. It is easier to use and less costly than the automated PD options. (See <a href=\"#H170768851\" class=\"local\">'Continuous ambulatory PD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Automated PD (APD) uses a cycler that performs multiple exchanges at night. It allows for a wide range of treatment options, which can be more easily tailored to the patient's needs than CAPD. The three options of APD are nightly intermittent PD, continuous cycling PD, and tidal peritoneal dialysis. (See <a href=\"#H170768858\" class=\"local\">'Automated PD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Successful CPD is dependent on the placement of a reliable access. In the pediatric patient, we suggest using a two-cuffed Tenckhoff catheter rather than a single-cuffed catheter to reduce the risk of peritonitis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Placement of the catheter with a downward-pointed exit site position also reduces the risk of peritonitis. (See <a href=\"#H170770118\" class=\"local\">'PD catheter'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that a peritoneal equilibration test (PET) be performed in all children undergoing CPD to determine the solute transport characteristics of the peritoneal membrane, which can assist in developing an adequate dialysis prescription (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Test fill volume is determined by the body surface area of the child. (See <a href=\"#H15616710\" class=\"local\">'Peritoneal membrane function'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The elements of the peritoneal prescription include selection of PD solutions and determination of the fill volume, dwell time, and the number of exchanges. The prescription is based on the individual patient needs for solute transport and removal of fluid, both of which can be increased by changes in the prescription, such as increasing the osmolality of the solution, fill volume, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> number of exchanges. (See <a href=\"#H15616717\" class=\"local\">'Prescription components'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infectious complications of CPD include peritonitis, and catheter exit <span class=\"nowrap\">site/tunnel</span> infections. We recommend daily care of the exit site and catheter that reduces the risk of exit site and tunnel infections (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). This includes proper handwashing by the care provider, daily assessment and cleansing of the exit site with antiseptic agents, catheter immobilization, trauma avoidance to the exit site and subcutaneous catheter, and the use of topical antibiotic prophylaxis. (See <a href=\"#H263453046\" class=\"local\">'Infectious complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Noninfectious complications are divided into the following categories:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Mechanical complications due to increased intraperitoneal pressure include hernia, fluid leak, and hydrothorax. (See <a href=\"#H15616792\" class=\"local\">'Mechanical complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Technique-related complications include ultrafiltration failure, which may be due to rapid solute transport, increased lymphatic flow, or aquaporin deficiency. (See <a href=\"#H15616822\" class=\"local\">'Technique related complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Catheter-related complications include dialysate leakage, catheter migration, cuff extrusion, and outflow occlusion. (See <a href=\"#H15616844\" class=\"local\">'Catheter-related complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Other complications include hemoperitoneum, pain, sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis, and nutritional and metabolic problems. (See <a href=\"#H350250243\" class=\"local\">'Other complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient mortality rates in children receiving CPD are significantly greater than the rates in transplanted children or the healthy population. The most common causes of death for pediatric CPD patients of all ages are cardiovascular disease and infection. Mortality is highest in young children (below five years of age) and infants. Pulmonary disease and severe <span class=\"nowrap\">oliguria/anuria</span> appear to be significant risk factors for mortality in infants and young children. (See <a href=\"#H15616859\" class=\"local\">'Patient survival'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The need to terminate CPD and transition to HD is most commonly the result of infectious complications. (See <a href=\"#H263453462\" class=\"local\">'Transition to hemodialysis'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-peritoneal-dialysis-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Hattori S, Yosioka K, Honda M, et al.
