Burns to the breast can potentially impair <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> destroy both function and aesthetics. Damage to the breast is particularly important to the prepubescent young girl. Absence of a nipple is a noticeable and a striking concern to both women and men burn patients, even when more extensive burns and scarring are present elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-the-female-breast/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The principles of burn reconstruction for the female breast are discussed here. An overview of reconstruction techniques, the local management of burns with topical antimicrobials and dressings, and the acute management of a burn patient are discussed elsewhere.

The most common causes of burns to the female breasts include scalds (range 66 to 89 percent), flame (range 8 to 34 percent), cooking oil (range 2 to 5 percent), and other trauma (&lt;5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-the-female-breast/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. The epidemiology of the global burden of burns is discussed elsewhere.

Familiarity of the location of the breast tissue in children is mandatory before beginning a debridement procedure to the anterior chest wall (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F63944\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63944 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F67072\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67072 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23140847\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL TREATMENT AND EARLY MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Burns to the breast are initially gently washed and debrided of loose burned skin and debris and dressed with topical antimicrobials and dressings. The burn eschar should not be excised from the nipple-areolar complex but should be allowed to separate spontaneously as healing proceeds from the deep glandular structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-the-female-breast/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. The relative avascular adipose tissue and connective tissue of the nonlactating breast requires a careful excision of all nonviable tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-the-female-breast/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In prepubertal girls, care should be taken not to excise the breast bud from the anterior chest wall during the debridement of the burned skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-the-female-breast/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In adult females, the breast mound should not be excised, if at all possible. </p><p>The depth of the burn helps determine the next phase of the treatment plan. Minor and superficial partial-thickness burns to the breast continue to be treated with local antimicrobial agents and dressings until healed. Deeper burns are treated with tissue coverage. Two treatment options for deep burns include spontaneous eschar separation and skin grafting or tangential excision of the eschar and skin grafting after burn demarcation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-the-female-breast/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Surgical experience, the overall condition of the patient, and the extensiveness of the burn will help determine the best approach.

Attention to detail and avoidance of excision of the breast bud are required to preserve the development of the breast. Young girls with burns to the anterior chest wall must have long-term follow-up to help ensure proper development and aesthetic appearance of the breasts during and after puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-the-female-breast/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The subcutaneous breast tissue may remain viable and the breast bud preserved if the burn is from a scalding injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-the-female-breast/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. During puberty, the breast parenchyma can develop under the scar, resulting in breast contracture and disfigurement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-the-female-breast/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The breast mound and the nipple-areolar complex are displaced, the contours are unclear, and the inframammary fold is effaced. This is illustrated by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a single-institution study, 193 prepubescent girls were treated for anterior chest wall burns over 20 years; 52 (27 percent) were treated with surgical debridement and split-thickness skin grafts, but only 11 with documented burns to the breast and nipple-areolar complex were available for long-term follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-the-female-breast/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The mean time from burn to follow-up was 26.5 years (range 19 to 32 years).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">All 11 women required reconstructive procedures after the onset of breast development to improve breast appearance. Complications of the burns included breast asymmetry, distortion, banding, and unpleasant skin texture. A variety of reconstructive techniques to improve breast development and appearance were used.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a longitudinal assessment of 28 prepubescent girls with severe burns to the anterior chest wall, 17 (61 percent) lost the nipple-areolar complex, but all developed breast tissue at puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-the-female-breast/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, 20 (71 percent) of these young patients experienced entrapment of the breast and required surgical intervention and incisional releases of the anterior chest wall to allow for proper breast development.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H39735043\"><span class=\"h1\">RECONSTRUCTION PRINCIPLES FOR THE DEVELOPING BREAST</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on observational data and the specifics of the burn, the ideal time to reconstruct the burned prepubescent breast is once breast maturity is attained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-the-female-breast/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Growth, development, and patient cooperation must be considered when planning reconstructive procedures. It is generally best to allow the scar to mature prior to reconstruction and to perform the procedures during early adulthood. If the release of the contracture is ill timed, the postpubertal development and growth of the breast parenchyma acquires a splayed, hypoplastic, and flattened form [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-the-female-breast/abstract/9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11</a>] (see <a href=\"#H23140629\" class=\"local\">'Reconstruction of the adult burned breast'</a> below). In severe cases, however, staged procedures throughout puberty may be required to optimize the aesthetic result.</p><p>The following principles are used to reconstruct the prepubescent burned breast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-the-female-breast/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Expansion of skin surface</strong> &ndash; Expansion of the breast skin surface can be accomplished by releasing contractures and applying thick split-thickness or full-thickness skin grafts at the inframammary fold, periareolar area, sternal area, and anterior axillary line. Dermal regeneration templates can be used in conjunction with skin grafts. Additional options for augmentation include the use of tissue expansion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a breast prosthesis and free flap tissue. An adequate tissue envelope, such as a submuscular insertion, must be used to protect the implant. Expanded skin flaps allow a near-normal mammary gland development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-the-female-breast/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Resurfacing</strong> &ndash; The shape and volume of the breast can be improved by completely resurfacing a severely scarred chest and breast with thick split-thickness or full-thickness skin grafts, with or without a dermal regeneration template.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Amastia</strong> &ndash; Amastia (absence of a breast) is corrected by performing total breast reconstruction. This is necessary when the breast bud and nipple-areolar complex are destroyed by the burn and the breast fails to develop. Reconstruction options include submuscular tissue expansion and implant placement, pedicled (latissimus dorsi) with breast implant or free flap options such as the transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM) flap, superior or inferior gluteal artery perforator fasciocutaneous flap, or the deep inferior epigastric perforator flap (DIEP). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-breast-reconstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of breast reconstruction&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Asymmetry</strong> &ndash; Asymmetry is best addressed by performing a breast reduction of the larger breast. In cases of a unilateral burn and impaired breast development, a unilateral breast reduction of the unburned breast may provide for a balanced cosmetic appearance. Burned breasts are less likely to develop a natural ptosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Absent or disfigured nipple papilla</strong> &ndash; Volume and shape should be corrected, followed by a second staged procedure to reconstruct the nipple papilla. Local tissue is typically used to form the papilla, but there is a risk of flap failure when using burned skin or skin grafts. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Absent or disfigured nipple-areolar complex</strong> &ndash; Once the scar is mature, tattooing provides an excellent option to enhance the appearance of the nipple-areolar complex and can match the color of skin tone or contralateral unburned nipple-areolar complex.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23140629\"><span class=\"h1\">RECONSTRUCTION OF THE ADULT BURNED BREAST</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The concepts for the reconstruction of the burned prepubescent breast can be applied to the adult breast (see <a href=\"#H39735043\" class=\"local\">'Reconstruction principles for the developing breast'</a> above). Reconstruction is performed when the burned breast envelope is insufficient to allow unrestricted breast growth and further development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-the-female-breast/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The goal of reconstructive surgery is to restore the four components of the postburn deformity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-the-female-breast/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in the shape and volume of the breast mound</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Damage to the skin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of definition of the inframammary crease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Displacement or loss of the nipple areolar complex</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4938273\"><span class=\"h2\">Restoration of the shape, volume, and skin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The shape, volume, and skin of the burned breast can be reconstructed using skin grafts, with or without dermal regeneration templates, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tissue flaps. Contracture release with full-thickness skin grafts <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> autologous tissue reconstruction are the traditional techniques for reconstruction of the burned breast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-the-female-breast/abstract/3,13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,13-17</a>]. Resurfacing of the postburn skin can be performed using the abdominal skin as a full-thickness skin graft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-the-female-breast/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>Reconstruction with a pedicled latissimus dorsi or transverse rectus myocutaneous flap provides adequate tissue coverage to reconstruct the shape and volume of a burned breast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-the-female-breast/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The decision to use either a free or pedicled flap depends on the availability of unburned skin, the reliability of the pedicle vessels (eg, thoracodorsal artery for a latissimus dorsi flap, deep inferior epigastric artery perforators for a transabdominal rectus flap, and superior and inferior gluteal artery perforators for the gluteal flaps), and the skill of the surgeon. </p><p>Free and pedicled flaps can provide a fully autologous option of reconstruction. When more volume is needed than can be provided by a flap alone, or when there is a limited availability of tissue for reconstruction, a flap can be used in combination with a tissue expander or prosthesis, such as a latissimus dorsi flap and a tissue expander or permanent prosthesis. This follows the principles of standard breast reconstruction following oncoplastic procedures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-breast-reconstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of breast reconstruction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Options for flap-based breast reconstruction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The advantages of using a local free or pedicled flap for reconstruction of a burned breast include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coverage with well-vascularized skin with superior pliability, elasticity, and durability compared with skin grafts.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coverage with tissue of similar texture and color.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reconstruction of breast anatomical landmarks, such as using the reverse abdominoplasty to recreate the inframammary fold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-the-female-breast/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

However, a retrospective review of 15 women with burns to the breasts reconstructed with contracture release and tissue expanders found no significant differences in major complications, operative time, and amount of time to expansion, compared with the same reconstruction procedures in 20 women with congenital breast anomalies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-the-female-breast/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In another study, burn patients who underwent endoscopically assisted placement of tissue expanders had significantly fewer major complications, required less operative time, and required less time to expand compared to expanders placed by the traditional open method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-the-female-breast/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>The use of dermal regeneration templates in breast reconstruction following burns reduces the recurrence of scar contracture and provides pliability to the reconstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-the-female-breast/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Prevention of infection of the template is fundamental, and close monitoring of the burn wounds is necessary. The use of negative pressure therapy helps keep the template in place.

There are no high-quality data from randomized trials or large reviews for the optimal reconstruction of the burned breast. The techniques applied to reconstruction of the breast for other conditions (eg, congenital abnormalities, cancer, aesthetics, and trauma) could in theory be applied to the burned breast. These techniques include injection of non-autologous fillers or lipomodelling, a technique that transfers autologous adipose tissue to remodel the breast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-the-female-breast/abstract/12,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,26,27</a>]. Theoretic concerns have been raised that injection of mature adipocytes and adipocyte-derived stem cells into the hormonally active environment of the breast may potentiate breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-the-female-breast/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

The reconstruction and redefinition of the inframammary fold can be performed by simple scar debridement and grafting of the area. Replacement of the burned skin and subdermal tissue with a normal skin advancement flap provides a natural and aesthetic solution.

Split-thickness skin grafts and customized pressure therapy is used to correct a contracture deformity. (See <a href=\"#H4938289\" class=\"local\">'Restoration of the nipple-areolar complex'</a> above.)</p><p>For burns that are minor, or only involve a portion of the breast, it is not critical that the women disrupt breastfeeding. Combination antibiotic ointments provide the best local care if the woman chooses to continue breastfeeding and should be continued until wounds are treated by tissue coverage. In circumstances of major burns to the breast or extensive burns to the body, cessation of lactation may be the optimal approach. Prophylactic management of burned lactating breasts with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bromocriptine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bromocriptine</a> stops lactation and induces breast involution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-the-female-breast/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Once engorgement has dissipated, surgical excision of the burn and tissue coverage can proceed. Burns in women who are no longer lactating may be treated with a variety of topical antimicrobial agents.

However, reduction mammaplasty in this group of patients may be safe and carry minimal risk. A retrospective review of six patients with full-thickness burns of the breasts and subsequent skin graft coverage observed no nipple loss, hematoma, infection, or major loss of skin flaps.

The later effects of burns to the breast, which are related to loss of normal tissue and scarring, include limitation of movement, pain, disfigurement, and social embarrassment. Damage to the breast is particularly important to the prepubescent young girl, but absence of a nipple is a noticeable and a striking concern to both female and male burn patients. Reconstruction depends on the depth and extensiveness of the burns and the availability of viable, unburned tissue.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial management of burns to the breast includes gentle debridement of loose burned skin, cleansing, and local topical dressings. The nipple and areolar complex should not be excised. (See <a href=\"#H23140847\" class=\"local\">'Initial treatment and early management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For prepubescent girls with burns to the anterior chest wall, the breast bud should be preserved during the debridement procedures. We suggest using split-thickness skin grafts to reconstruct the burned anterior chest wall in young girls and prefer to delay reconstruction with flaps until after breast development (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The release of contractures and more extensive reconstructive procedures, such as pedicled tissue transfer, are performed as the breast tissue develops. (See <a href=\"#H4938156\" class=\"local\">'Prepubescent females'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For burns to the adult woman's breast, the breast mound should be preserved if tissue is viable. The reconstruction in the fully developed breast needs to take into consideration the restoration of nipple height; the adequate definition of the inframammary fold; and the symmetry in volume, size, and shape of both breasts. We suggest using autologous tissue, either as a free or pedicled flap (with or without prosthesis insertion) to provide the optimal cosmetic result for restoring volume and shape (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). A tissue expander or implant can be used to enhance the results if the autologous tissue is insufficient. (See <a href=\"#H4938273\" class=\"local\">'Restoration of the shape, volume, and skin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For burns to the breast during pregnancy and lactation, we use combination antibiotic ointments as the initial treatment and avoid the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=silver-sulfadiazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">silver sulfadiazine</a>, cerium nitrate, and povidone-iodine. (See <a href=\"#H23141308\" class=\"local\">'Burns during pregnancy and lactation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For major burns to the breast during lactation, we use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bromocriptine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bromocriptine</a> for cessation of lactation. For minor or limited burns to the breast, the option to continue to breastfeed is at the discretion of the woman.
