However, patients taking oral antipsychotics for schizophrenia have an estimated adherence rate of less than 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-long-acting-injectable-antipsychotic-drugs/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. For a significant subset, nonadherence leads to relapse and hospitalization, which in some cases can be repeated and frequent.</p><p>Factors contributing to medication nonadherence among individuals with schizophrenia include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many patients with the disorder do not believe they have an illness and therefore reject treatment. This is particularly likely in patients early in their course of illness. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antipsychotic drugs can cause immediate unpleasant side effects, neurological consequences, metabolic changes, and the potential for long-term movement disorders.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients treated with antipsychotic drugs experience residual hallucinations or delusions that &ldquo;convince&rdquo; them to stop the medication.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H495788\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary indication for long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics is for patients with schizophrenia who have a history of good response to an oral antipsychotic but who adhered poorly to the medication, leading to relapse. The efficacy of LAI antipsychotics on relapse in schizophrenia is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H19548576\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> below.)</p><p>LAI antipsychotics may be indicated for schizophrenia under other circumstances, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who, after stopping antipsychotics, become symptomatic with behaviors leading to highly adverse consequences (eg, arrests, assaults, self harm, loss of employment or housing). In addition to a possible effect on relapse, use of an LAI antipsychotic in these cases can provide early identification of nonadherence, ie, a missed visit for LAI antipsychotic administration. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with schizophrenia whose illness may be considered treatment-resistant except for a question of medication nonadherence. If the patient then responds to an LAI antipsychotic trial, then the prior lack of response to an oral antipsychotic may have been due to nonadherence. Alternatively, it may be that the oral ingestion process somehow did not build a high enough blood and subsequent brain drug level.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who respond well to a specific oral antipsychotic medication, but have a side effect that is dose dependent (eg, EPS or sexual dysfunction). These patients may benefit from the consistent blood level without higher daily peaks provided by the corresponding LAI antipsychotic.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H495796\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contraindications to LAI antipsychotics include hypersensitivity to the medications or formulations. Haloperidol-LAI and fluphenazine-LAI are contraindicated in severe central nervous system depression and coma. Unique contraindications include Parkinson&rsquo;s disease for haloperidol-LAI and subcortical brain damage, blood dyscrasias, and hepatic disease for fluphenazine-LAI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-long-acting-injectable-antipsychotic-drugs/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H496039\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each of the available long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics has an individual chemical makeup that is essentially that of the parent oral compound. The first-generation antipsychotics, fluphenazine-LAI and haloperidol-LAI, are potent dopamine blockers with less receptor activity for other neurotransmitters. The second-generation antipsychotics, aripiprazole-LAI, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aripiprazole-short-acting-oral-and-injectable-and-long-acting-injectable-abilify-maintena-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aripiprazole</a> lauroxil-LAI, paliperidone-LAI, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paliperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paliperidone</a> 12-week-LAI, risperidone-LAI, and olanzapine-LAI, rely on a blockade of both dopamine and serotonin receptors. </p><p>The form of pharmacologic delivery of the LAI antipsychotics determines the immediacy of release, the sites of injection, and the potential interval between doses. The delivery system varies among the drugs. A method effective for one compound has not necessarily been applicable to the next. The first-generation LAI antipsychotics, fluphenazine-LAI and haloperidol-LAI, both utilize an ester form of the oral compound attached to a fatty acid (decanoic acid) chain. Once esterified, they are dissolved in an oil. Upon injection, the ester slowly disassociates from the oil allowing a gradual release of the medication over time. </p><p>The second-generation LAI antipsychotics have required other means of delivery. Risperidone-LAI utilizes a microsphere technology. The active compound, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risperidone</a>, is embedded into microspheres made of a polymer that degrades similarly to dissolvable suture. </p><p>Paliperidone-LAI and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paliperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paliperidone</a> 12-week-LAI are long-acting formulations of paliperidone, a metabolite of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risperidone</a>. Both products utilize a crystal salt of paliperidone and palmitic acid; however, paliperidone 12-week-LAI uses larger particle size resulting in slower dissolution and a longer dosing interval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-long-acting-injectable-antipsychotic-drugs/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Similarly, olanzapine-LAI is a crystal salt of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olanzapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olanzapine</a> and pamoic acid. Aripiprazole-LAI, paliperidone-LAI and olanzapine-LAI are suspended in water and injected. Once injected, the carrier salts slowly dissolve, releasing active medication. An advantage of paliperidone-LAI and olanzapine-LAI is the more immediate release of medication. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aripiprazole-short-acting-oral-and-injectable-and-long-acting-injectable-abilify-maintena-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Aripiprazole</a> lauroxil-LAI is a prodrug of aripiprazole. After intramuscular injection <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aripiprazole-lauroxil-long-acting-injectable-aristada-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aripiprazole lauroxil</a> undergoes enzyme-mediated hydrolysis to form the N-hydroxymethyl aripiprazole intermediate, which is rapidly converted to aripiprazole via water-mediated hydrolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-long-acting-injectable-antipsychotic-drugs/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19548569\"><span class=\"h1\">ADMINISTRATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with oral antipsychotics, dosing of the long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics is optimized when clinical effectiveness is achieved while minimizing size effects. A table summarizes the delivery system, injection interval, and dosages of each LAI antipsychotic drug (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F59201\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59201 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>The first-generation antipsychotics, fluphenazine-LAI and haloperidol-LAI, are administered via intramuscular injection in the deltoid or gluteal muscles. Due to their oil based nature and high viscosity, a Z-track injection technique is used to minimize leakage of the compound from the injection site (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F69880\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69880 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-long-acting-injectable-antipsychotic-drugs/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Dosing of the first-generation LAI antipsychotics is based on the patient&rsquo;s dose of oral medication. Dose conversion formulations are given for each of the products discussed below. These formulations should be interpreted with caution in certain populations, i.e. <span class=\"nowrap\">poor/extensive</span> metabolizers and the elderly, since LAI do not undergo first pass metabolism which could possibly lead to variant concentrations. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25343020\"><span class=\"h2\">Fluphenazine-LAI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The dosing conversion from the oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluphenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluphenazine</a> tablets to the LAI is approximately 1 mg oral administered daily to 1.25 mg LAI administered every three weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-long-acting-injectable-antipsychotic-drugs/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Patients should continue to supplement the LAI with oral medication for at least the first week after receiving the LAI due to its delay in achieving therapeutic plasma concentrations. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25343035\"><span class=\"h2\">Haloperidol-LAI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial dose of haloperidol-LAI is 10 to 20 times the previous daily dose of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a>, given in four-week intervals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-long-acting-injectable-antipsychotic-drugs/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, the initial haloperidol-LAI injection should not exceed 100 mg regardless of previous antipsychotic requirements in patients who are haloperidol-LAI naive. In cases where conversion requires administration of greater than 100 mg, the dose should be given in two separate injections, with 100 mg administered on day one and the remainder given in three to seven days. </p><p>The usual maintenance dose is 10 to 15 times the previous daily dose of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a> given as a single injection. When haloperidol-LAI has been initiated using a loading strategy, maintenance dosing is typically started in the third month of therapy. </p><p>Several loading-dose strategies have been evaluated for haloperidol-LAI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-long-acting-injectable-antipsychotic-drugs/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Use of these techniques reduces the time required to achieve therapeutic plasma concentrations and eliminates the need for overlap with oral medication.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A common strategy involves giving an initial injection of 20 times the oral daily dose. If the dose of haloperidol-LAI exceeds 100 mg then the dose should be administered as two separate injections. For large initial doses of haloperidol-LAI (ie, &ge;400 mg) the total dose is sometimes given in a series of three injections (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F59201\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59201 \">table 1</a>). Four weeks after initiation, the total dose is reduced by 25 percent and given as a single injection. The dose is again reduced by 25 percent of the original at the eight-week mark, and the patient is continued on this dose as maintenance. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another method is to initiate haloperidol-LAI at the anticipated maintenance dose and supplement the patient with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a>. If this approach is taken, oral medication should be gradually tapered over a one month period. We typically reduce the dose by 25 percent at weekly intervals; however, some patients may require faster or slower tapering schedules depending on individual response. While this strategy increases the time necessary to achieve steady state concentrations, it offers the clinician more control over the total amount of haloperidol the patient receives each day.</p><p/><p>Second-generation LAI antipsychotics differ from first-generation drugs in aspects of administration and dosing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H970084823\"><span class=\"h2\">Aripiprazole-LAI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial and maintenance dose of aripiprazole-LAI is a single monthly 400 mg injection in a gluteal muscle, according to the licensing information in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-long-acting-injectable-antipsychotic-drugs/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A two-week overlap with 10 or 20 mg oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aripiprazole-short-acting-oral-and-injectable-and-long-acting-injectable-abilify-maintena-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aripiprazole</a> or other oral antipsychotic is recommended with the first LAI injection, or if &gt;5 weeks have elapsed since the previous aripiprazole-LAI injection. Patients who do not tolerate the 400 mg dose can receive a reduced dose of 300 mg monthly. The 300 mg LAI monthly dose is also recommended for patients who are known poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 and for patients also receiving treatment for 14 days or more with medications that are strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or 2D6. Additional dose reductions are made for patients with more than one of these factors. Full details are provided in the individual drug monograph from Lexicomp. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pharmacogenomics#H2216941\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pharmacogenomics&quot;, section on 'CYP2D6 variants'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2580397325\"><span class=\"h2\">Aripiprazole lauroxil-LAI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial dosing of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aripiprazole-short-acting-oral-and-injectable-and-long-acting-injectable-abilify-maintena-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aripiprazole</a> lauroxil-LAI is based on the patient&rsquo;s current dose of oral aripiprazole (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F59201\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59201 \">table 1</a>). Regardless of starting dose, patients should be continued on oral aripiprazole for three weeks after receiving the initial injection of aripiprazole lauroxil-LAI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-long-acting-injectable-antipsychotic-drugs/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The 441 mg dose of aripiprazole lauroxil-LAI has the option of administration in the deltoid or gluteal muscles, all other dosages should be given in the gluteal muscle only. Injections are given every four weeks for the 441 mg and 662 mg strengths; however, the 882 mg strength can be administer every four or six weeks. The 1064 mg strength is administered every two months. Serum drug concentrations for both the 882 mg every six weeks and the 1064 mg every two months regimens resemble those for 662 mg every four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-long-acting-injectable-antipsychotic-drugs/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Dose reductions are recommended in individuals who are taking strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 for two or more weeks, and in known poor metabolizers of CYP2D6. In cases where only one CYP pathway is impacted, patients should be reduced to the next lower strength of aripiprazole lauroxil-LAI. For patients taking 882 mg every six weeks or 1064 mg every two months, the next lower dose is 441 mg every four weeks. In cases where both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are impaired, either by enzyme inhibitors or genetic deficiencies, only the 441 mg strength of aripiprazole lauroxil-LAI is recommended. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25343054\"><span class=\"h2\">Olanzapine-LAI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dosing of olanzapine-LAI is based on the patient&rsquo;s dose of oral medication; however, the conversation ratio is dose dependent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F59201\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59201 \">table 1</a>). Supplementation of the initial LAI dose with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olanzapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olanzapine</a> is not necessary. Olanzapine-LAI should only be administered via deep intramuscular gluteal injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-long-acting-injectable-antipsychotic-drugs/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Due to the potential for a severe adverse reaction to olanzapine-LAI, patients must be observed for at least three hours after every injection.

No overlap with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paliperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paliperidone</a> is necessary after initiating paliperidone-LAI. Some patients may benefit from lower or higher maintenance doses of paliperidone-LAI; dosage recommendations range from 39 to 234 mg. Paliperidone is primarily excreted through the urine so dose adjustments are necessary in patients with mild renal dysfunction. If creatinine clearance is 50 to 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min,</span> then paliperidone-LAI should be initiated at 156 mg on day one followed by 117 mg one week later.

In so doing, LAIs have not been tested in the population for which they may be best suited, ie, patients with unstable schizophrenia and frequent relapse. Other methodologic limitations included inadequate blinding in some trials and that patients in both LAI and oral groups received staff support in randomized trials that did not reflect real world conditions. </p><p>Clinical trials have sought to address some of these shortcomings by including patients with more unstable schizophrenia and by measuring a wider range of clinical outcomes. Results have been mixed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-long-acting-injectable-antipsychotic-drugs/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A clinical trial randomly assigned 369 patients with unstable schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder to either risperidone-LAI or to an oral antipsychotic and followed for up to two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-long-acting-injectable-antipsychotic-drugs/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Participants were limited to those hospitalized at the time of enrollment (40 percent), hospitalized within the last two years, or having increased their use of health services to prevent relapse and hospitalization. Study personnel rating patients&rsquo; clinical status were blinded to group assignment. After two years of treatment, no difference was seen in hospitalization rate (hazard ratio = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.63-1.20) or duration of drug adherence between the two groups. Despite efforts to enroll patients for whom LAI antipsychotics were most indicated, exclusions were by practical necessity made due to recent substance detoxification, unstable living arrangements, safety, and lack of consent. Other limitations were an underpowered sample and possible bias of unblinded treating physicians. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 15-month clinical trial of 450 patients with schizophrenia, who had been taken into custody by the criminal justice system at least two times in the previous two years, randomly assigned them to open-label treatment with paliperidone-LAI or one of seven daily oral antipsychotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-long-acting-injectable-antipsychotic-drugs/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The primary end point was time to treatment failure, which included <span class=\"nowrap\">arrest/incarceration,</span> psychiatric hospitalization, suicide, inadequate efficacy, discontinuation due to tolerability, or increased services to prevent imminent hospitalization. After 15 months, fewer subjects receiving paliperidone-LAI experienced treatment failure compared to patients receiving oral antipsychotics (39.8 versus 53.7 percent). Median time to first treatment failure was longer for paliperidone-LAI compared oral antipsychotics (416 versus 226 days). The most common reasons for treatment failure were <span class=\"nowrap\">arrest/incarceration</span> and psychiatric hospitalization. No differences were seen between groups on measures of social functioning or severity of illness. Patients taking paliperidone-LAI were more likely to experience extrapyramidal symptoms, weight gain, and prolactin elevation compared with patients taking oral antipsychotic drugs. Medication adherence rates, to the extent that they could be measured or estimated, were higher in the paliperidone-LAI compared with oral antipsychotics as measured by prescriptions or pharmacy refills (95.2 versus 77.2 or 24.3 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective, rater-blinded, clinical trial randomly assigned 764 patients with a recent diagnosis (within one to five years) of schizophrenia to 24 months of open-label treatment with either paliperidone-LAI or one of six oral antipsychotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-long-acting-injectable-antipsychotic-drugs/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The primary outcome was time to relapse. At study conclusion, time to relapse was significantly longer for the paliperidone-LAI group compared with those taking oral antipsychotics (469 versus 249 days). Study adherence was high, with low drop-out rates for both groups (77.3 versus 73.3 percent). Treatment emergent adverse effects were similar between groups but numerically favored oral medication. </p><p/><p>A population-based cohort study of 29,823 patients with schizophrenia analyzed data from a nationwide registry in Sweden, including patients without regard to adherence or relapse, and avoiding selection bias by using each patient as <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> own control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-long-acting-injectable-antipsychotic-drugs/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. LAI antipsychotics were associated with a 22 percent lower risk of rehospitalization compared with equivalent oral formulations (hazard ratio = 0.78; 95% CI, 0.72-0.84). Treatment with LAI antipsychotics was associated with a lower rate of treatment failure (hazard ratios = 0.65-0.80) compared with all oral antipsychotics medications other than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a>. </p><p>Consistent with findings comparing first-generation antipsychotics (FGA) and second-generation antipsychotics (SGA) taken orally for schizophrenia, no difference in efficacy was found in a head-to-head comparison of first and second generation LAI antipsychotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-long-acting-injectable-antipsychotic-drugs/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Three hundred and eleven patients with DSM-IV <span class=\"nowrap\">schizophrenia/schizoaffective</span> who were assessed as likely to benefit from a LAI antipsychotic and at risk of relapse due to treatment noncompliance, co-occurring substance abuse, or both were randomly assigned to receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paliperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paliperidone</a> palmitate or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a>&nbsp;decanoate&nbsp;for at least 12 months. No significant difference was seen in the rate of &ldquo;efficacy failure&rdquo; between the two groups (33.8 versus 32.4 percent, respectively). Events comprising efficacy failure included a psychiatric hospitalization or other need for treatment at a higher level of care, inability to discontinue an oral antipsychotic after eight weeks on the LAI, or discontinuation of the LAI due to inadequate benefit. Patients receiving paliperidone, on average, gained more weight and experienced greater increases in prolactin levels compared with patients receiving haloperidol, while patients receiving haloperidol experienced more severe akathisia.</p><p>There has been limited head-to-head comparison between second generation LAI antipsychotics. A 28-week, unblinded, randomized noninferiority trial compared aripiprazole-LAI (400 mg) with paliperidone-LAI (flexible dose 78 to 234 mg) monthly in 295 patients with stable schizophrenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-long-acting-injectable-antipsychotic-drugs/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. After 28 weeks, patients receiving aripiprazole-LAI reported greater improvement from baseline on the Heinrichs-Carpenter Quality-of-Life Scale compared with patients receiving paliperidone-LAI (score of 7.47 versus 2.80 points). The difference in scores exceeded predefined criteria for a clinically meaningful difference in favor of aripiprazole-LAI. </p><p>In view of the limited ability of clinical trials to study patients for whom LAI antipsychotics may be most useful, and based on our clinical experience, we suggest the use of LAI antipsychotics for patients with schizophrenia who relapse due to medication nonadherence. We have found that LAI antipsychotics may help some patients break a cycle of multiple hospitalizations resulting from unstable illness, often compounded by chaotic social structure and substance use. </p><p>Although not rigorously studied, based on our clinical experience, LAI antipsychotics should be used in conjunction with cognitive and behavioral techniques that help patients understand their illness and need for treatment. Such concurrent treatment is unfortunately not routinely available, leading to an overreliance on long-acting medication as sole treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19548590\"><span class=\"h1\">ADVERSE EVENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Local injection site complications, such as pain or redness, have been observed in up to 10 percent of individuals receiving long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics. At a comparable dose, the LAI antipsychotics have lower maximum blood levels and lesser dose-related side effects (including sedation, and hyperprolactinemia) compared to their oral counterparts, due to differences in pharmacokinetics. There is no advantage to LAIs compared to oral antipsychotics with side effects unrelated to dose and blood level (including tardive dyskinesia, and metabolic syndrome). Each LAI has the same US FDA warnings, precautions, and contraindications as its parent compound.
