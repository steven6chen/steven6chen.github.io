People with arthritis should exercise. In the long run, regular exercise can help reduce the pain of arthritis, even though exercising might be painful at first.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31048481\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I do before starting an exercise program?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before starting an exercise program, talk with your doctor or nurse. Ask him or her if there are any exercises or sports you should or should not do. You can also ask him or her if you should see a physical therapist (exercise expert) before you start to exercise.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31048488\"><span class=\"h1\">What kind of exercise program should I do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That's up to you. But the exercise program you choose should work in 2 ways. It should:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make your muscles stronger &ndash; Doing this can reduce pain and help to protect your joints and make them stronger. One way to make muscles stronger is to use weights or weight machines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increase your heart rate and breathing &ndash; Doing this can improve your heart health and lower your blood pressure. Doctors recommend that you increase your heart rate with low-impact activities, such as walking, biking, or swimming. Low-impact activities are easier on your joints than high-impact activities. Doctors do not usually recommend high-impact activities, such as running, for people with arthritis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31048495\"><span class=\"h1\">How much should I exercise?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should try to exercise about 30 to 40 minutes a day, on most days of the week. If you can't exercise for 30 to 40 minutes at a time, break your exercise up into shorter sessions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31048502\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I exercise safely if I have arthritis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have arthritis, you can exercise safely by following these tips:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Start slowly and increase your exercise program slowly</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take 10 to 15 minutes to warm up before exercising &ndash; To warm up, you can walk slowly, march in place, or stretch your muscles.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Start with lighter weights and slowly increase them (if you use weights)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make sure to cool down for about 5 minutes after exercising &ndash; To cool down, you can walk slowly or stretch your muscles.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Protect your joints when you exercise by:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Walking on a flat surface, if you have hip, knee, foot, or ankle problems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Wearing shoes that support and cushion your feet</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Paying attention to pain &ndash; If you have pain, stop or change what you are doing.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Avoiding movements that twist your joints</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Wearing a knee brace or other support, if your doctor or nurse recommends it</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31048509\"><span class=\"h1\">What exercises can help with different kinds of arthritis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain exercises can help with different kinds of arthritis and different symptoms.</p><p>For osteoarthritis and most other types of arthritis, it's important to move your joints every day, even if they hurt.
