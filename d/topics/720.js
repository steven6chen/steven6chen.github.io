However, amiodarone is associated with a number of side effects, including thyroid dysfunction (both hypo- and hyperthyroidism), which is due to amiodarone's high iodine content and its direct toxic effect on the thyroid. This topic will review the major effects of amiodarone on thyroid function. The clinical use and other side effects of amiodarone are reviewed elsewhere.

For type I AIT, amiodarone should not be discontinued until hyperthyroid symptoms are well controlled with thionamides, since worsening hyperthyroid symptoms due to increased T3 levels may occur when the amiodarone is discontinued. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Should amiodarone be discontinued?'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H38\"><span class=\"h4\">Type I AIT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Type I AIT is hyperthyroidism with increased synthesis of T4 and T3; the excess iodine provides increased substrate, resulting in enhanced thyroid hormone production.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest thionamides as our first choice of therapy to treat type I AIT (whether <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> is continued or discontinued) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>) (see <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Thionamides'</a> above). Although radioiodine ablation has been reported to have been used (in rare patients with high enough radioiodine uptake), this is usually not an option due to low radioiodine uptake in the majority of type I patients. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Radioiodine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Higher than average doses of thionamides are usually needed (30 to 40 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methimazole</a> or 450 to 600 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propylthiouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propylthiouracil</a> [PTU] daily). Perchlorate or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> are sometimes added to speed recovery, however, perchlorate is not available in the United States. In addition, perchlorate has been associated, albeit rarely, with aplastic anemia. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Thionamides'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients are refractory to antithyroid drug therapy; they should be treated by thyroidectomy. When balancing the risk of a surgical procedure during careful cardiovascular monitoring with the risk of several months of unmonitored and uncontrolled thyrotoxicosis, the advantages of surgery in this setting become compelling. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H39\"><span class=\"h4\">Type II AIT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Type II AIT is a destructive thyroiditis that results in the release of excess T4 and T3, but not increased synthesis. It is typically seen in patients without underlying thyroid disease and is caused by a direct toxic effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> on the thyroid gland. The hyperthyroid phase may last from several weeks to several months and is often followed by a hypothyroid phase and then recovery.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who develop type II AIT, we suggest glucocorticoid therapy as our first-line drug (whether <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> is continued or discontinued) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We typically start with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (40 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> and continue therapy for one to two months before tapering (to avoid exacerbations of hyperthyroidism). (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3550316545\"><span class=\"h4\">Mechanism unknown</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the mechanism of the hyperthyroidism is uncertain or the patient appears to have &quot;mixed&quot; type I and type II AIT, a combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methimazole</a> (40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> is reasonable initial therapy. A rapid response suggests type II AIT; the methimazole can then be tapered or stopped. A poor or slow initial response argues for type I AIT. (See <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Treatment if mechanism unknown'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-and-thyroid-dysfunction/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Basaria S, Cooper DS.
