Prevention efforts have focused on the very low birth weight (VLBW, BW &lt;1500 g) and extremely low birth weight (ELBW, BW &lt;1000 g) infants who are at the highest risk for invasive candidal infections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-candida-infection-in-neonates#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and risk factors for Candida infection in neonates&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-candida-infection-in-neonates#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and risk factors for Candida infection in neonates&quot;, section on 'Risk factors for invasive candidiasis'</a>.)</p><p>Preventive management includes general measures that can be applied broadly to all infants in the neonatal intensive care unit; and administration of prophylactic antifungal agents, which is reserved for ELBW infants who are cared for in NICUs with a high baseline rate of systemic fungal infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL MEASURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>General measures are focused upon reducing cross-infection of <em>Candida</em> in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and risk factors that increase the likelihood of candidemia. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Handwashing, the use of gloves, and avoidance of artificial fingernails to reduce the rate of horizontal transmission from health care worker to infant. However, these measures alone may not be sufficient to prevent horizontal transmission because of the difficulty in eradicating <em>Candida</em> from the hands of health care workers. In one study, commonly used antiseptics or disinfectants for handwashing demonstrated varying degrees of in vitro inhibition of growth of <em>Candida</em> species recovered from hospitalized patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Single room isolation or cohorting infants who are colonized or infected with <em>Candida</em>. With this intervention, health care workers can be segregated to only caring for infants with candidal colonization or infection, and caring for noninfected and noncolonized infants. Although patient isolation or cohorting is often a recommended routine infection control measure, there are no clinical trials demonstrating that this practice prevents <em>Candida </em>cross-infection in the NICU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduction of risk factors associated with <em>Candida</em> overgrowth (ie, high density of candidal colonization), which increases the likelihood of disseminated systemic infection. Interventions that promote overgrowth of <em>Candida</em> include H2 receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors, broad-spectrum antibiotics (eg, third generation cephalosporins and imipenems), and glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. In addition, the use of topical petrolatum is associated with an increase in invasive fungal infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Minimizing or avoiding these risk factors, if clinically appropriate, may decrease the density of candidal colonization and the likelihood of candidemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-candida-infection-in-neonates#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and risk factors for Candida infection in neonates&quot;, section on 'Risk factors for invasive candidiasis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical hardware, such as central venous catheters, that provides a site for blood-stream invasion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> colonization.

In a meta-analysis of four trials (including 1800 very preterm or very low birth weight [VLBW] infants), prophylactic therapy was associated with a lower incidence of invasive fungal infection compared with placebo (relative risk [RR] 0.2, 95% CI 0.14-0.27); mortality was not significantly reduced (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.72-1.05) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, these results need to be interpreted cautiously because of methodologic weaknesses in the included trials (including quasi-randomization, lack of allocation concealment, and lack of blinding of intervention and outcomes assessment) and because there was significant heterogeneity between trials.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Fluconazole</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical trials in preterm infants have demonstrated that prophylactic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fluconazole</a> reduced candidal colonization and invasive infection in preterm infants, but did not decrease mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>In a 2015 meta-analysis of 10 trials (including 1371 very preterm or VLBW infants), systemic antifungal prophylaxis compared with placebo or no drug reduced the incidence of invasive fungal infection (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.31-0.59); mortality was not significantly reduced (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.61-1.02) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Nine of the 10 trials used systemic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fluconazole</a> prophylaxis. Results were similar among extremely low birth weight (ELBW; ie, BW &lt;1000 g) infants who are the most vulnerable to invasive candidiasis. In the subgroup analysis (which included two studies with a total of 461 ELBW infants), systemic antifungal prophylaxis reduced the incidence of invasive fungal infection (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.14-0.63) but did not significantly reduce mortality (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.55-1.23). The trials in the meta-analysis were generally of good methodological quality; however, the incidence of baseline invasive candidal infection in these trials (16 percent) was much higher than that reported from large cohort studies (&lt;5 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H112287551\"><span class=\"h3\">Long-term outcome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The long-term outcome data for prophylactic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fluconazole</a> is very limited. In the few patients evaluated, there appears to be no long-term adverse effects of prophylactic fluconazole therapy in ELBW survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the previously discussed meta-analysis, one trial found no difference in neurodevelopmental status and quality of life in the 38 of the 86 survivors who were evaluated in a follow-up study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/17,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,20,21</a>]. There were also no differences in growth or long-term risk of cholestasis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the clinical trial of ELBW infants, after adjusting for confounding factors, there was no difference in neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 to 22 months corrected age between the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fluconazole</a> prophylaxis and control groups, based on Bayley-III cognition composite scores, or a diagnosis of blindness, deafness, or cerebral palsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based upon the currently available literature, our approach is not to start antifungal prophylaxis for all preterm infants. Antifungal prophylaxis is reserved for extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants (BW &lt;1000 g) who are cared for in NICUs with a high baseline rate of systemic fungal infection. This approach is consistent with the 2009 Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. Others have suggested that prophylactic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fluconazole</a> be used in ELBW infants in NICUs with a baseline rate of invasive candidiasis of 5 to 10 percent and that have excellent adherence to infection control measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p>When antifungal prophylaxis is provided, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fluconazole</a> rather than other agents due to the higher quality of evidence supporting its efficacy. In this setting, fluconazole dosing of 3 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per dose every two or three days appears to be effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nystatin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">nystatin</a> is a reasonable alternative based on limited data demonstrating comparable efficacy. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Fluconazole'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Nystatin and miconazole'</a> above.)</p><p>Broad use of antifungal prophylaxis for all preterm infants is discouraged because of the concern of promoting resistant <em>Candida</em> species within the NICU. Universal prophylaxis in a NICU with a low incidence of candidiasis would expose a large number of infants to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fluconazole</a> to prevent a single case of infection, without an apparent reduction in mortality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Surveillance cultures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systematic screening for <em>Candida</em> colonization has been suggested as a possible tool in preventing fungal infections in high-risk patients by initiating antifungal therapy when colonization is detected.</p><p>In one retrospective study that obtained candidal surveillance cultures in 51 preterm infants born at &le;28 weeks gestation, 16 infants developed candidal colonization (ie, stool or bronchoalveolar lavage <span class=\"nowrap\">fluid/nasopharyngeal</span> secretions) and were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liposomal-amphotericin-b-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">liposomal amphotericin B</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flucytosine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">flucytosine</a>. All colonized infants developed <em>Candida</em> infection within 24 to 72 hours after colonization was detected (12 with candidemia, 2 with mucocutaneous candidiasis, and 2 with <em>Candida</em> pneumonia). Although six infants with <em>Candida</em> infections died, only one death was attributed to <em>Candida</em> infection. Thirty-five noncolonized infants did not develop <em>Candida</em> infection and did not receive antifungal therapy.</p><p>However, further studies are needed to determine if the benefits outweigh the risks and costs of screening for fungal colonization in high-risk neonates and if antifungal therapy should be initiated when colonization is detected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H207853895\"><span class=\"h1\">EMPIRIC ANTIFUNGAL THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no guidelines for initiating empiric therapy for invasive candidiasis like those that exist for group B Streptococcus infections. An observational study of 136 extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants with invasive candidiasis who were cared for at National Institute Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network sites in the United States suggested that empiric antifungal therapy for invasive candidiasis (ie, prior to receiving culture results) increased survival without neurological impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, there was no difference in mortality between treated and untreated. The authors suggest that a large multicenter trial is warranted to see if there is a benefit of empirical antifungal therapy in ELBW infants.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H454916249\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER POTENTIAL INTERVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of lactoferrin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> probiotics to reduce gastrointestinal <em>Candida</em> colonization has been suggested. In one prospective study of preterm infants, gastrointestinal<em> Candida</em> colonization rates were lower in patients who received either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactobacillus-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Lactobacillus</a> reuteri or<em> L. rhamnosus </em>compared with patients who received no probiotic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Secondary analyses of data from a multicenter randomized controlled study in 472 preterm very low birth weight (VLBW) infants showed that bovine lactoferrin (with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactobacillus-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Lactobacillus</a> rhamnosus) did not decrease fungal colonization rates compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, the risk of invasive fungal infections was lower in infants who received prophylactic bovine lactoferrin (both with and without <em>lactobacillus rhamnosus</em>) compared with controls.</p><p>The use of lactoferrin and probiotics should be limited to clinical trials until it has been shown that this intervention is beneficial and safe, and an effective standardized regimen has been developed.</p><p>Lactoferrin and probiotics for the prevention of sepsis in preterm neonates are a discussed in greater detail separately.
