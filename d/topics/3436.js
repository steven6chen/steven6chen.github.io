Chromoblastomycosis occurs in tropical and subtropical climates and is one of the most common endemic implantation (subcutaneous) mycoses. </p><p>The infection begins at the site of inoculation, affects the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues, and exhibits diverse clinical findings. Early disease often presents as erythematous macules or papules that develop verrucous or hyperkeratotic features (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F113889\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113889 \">picture 1I</a>). Without treatment, the infection slowly progresses to larger areas of skin involvement with nodular, verrucous, tumoral, plaque, or scar-like morphologies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F113890%7EDERM%2F113897%7EDERM%2F113891%7EDERM%2F113899%7EDERM%2F113894\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113890 graphicRef113897 graphicRef113891 graphicRef113899 graphicRef113894 \">picture 1A-E</a>). Severe disease can be associated with tissue fibrosis and lymphedema, leading to physical disability (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F113906\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113906 \">picture 2</a>). </p><p>The diverse clinical findings of chromoblastomycosis mimic other infectious or noninfectious diseases. The diagnosis is confirmed through the identification of characteristic fungal elements called muriform cells (also known as sclerotic bodies or Medlar bodies) with a potassium hydroxide preparation or skin biopsy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F113895\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113895 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p>Although early, small lesions of chromoblastomycosis can be treated with surgical removal, long-term oral antifungal therapy is the treatment of choice for more extensive disease.

Infections are primarily caused by two genera: <em>Fonsecaea</em> species (<em>F. pedrosoi, F. monophora, F. nubica, F. pugnacious</em>,<em> </em>and<em> F. brasiliensis</em>) and <em>Cladophialophora</em> species (<em>C. carrionii</em> and <em>C. samoensis</em>). <em>F. pedrosoi</em> and <em>C. carrionii</em> are the most frequent causes. Sporadically, <em>Exophiala</em> species, (<em>E. dermatitidis, E. jeanselmei,</em> and<em> E. spinifera</em>), <em>Phialophora</em> species (<em>P. verrucosa</em> and<em> P. richardsiae</em>),<em> </em>and <em>Rhinocladiella</em> <em>aquaspersa</em> are isolated from patients with chromoblastomycosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoblastomycosis/abstract/2-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-15</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H517733206\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chromoblastomycosis is most prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F113907\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113907 \">figure 1</a>). <em>F. pedrosoi</em> and <em>C. carrionii</em>, the most frequent etiologic agents, typically occur in humid or semiarid climates, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoblastomycosis/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. Scattered infections have been reported in temperate zones, and there are rare reports of chromoblastomycosis occurring after natural disasters in nonendemic areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoblastomycosis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. </p><p>Causative fungi can be found in soil and plant fragments, and plant fragments associated with pigmented fungal elements have been found in histologic specimens of chromoblastomycosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoblastomycosis/abstract/19,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,22</a>]. In accordance with these findings, risk for infection is strongly associated with cutaneous trauma obtained during outdoor work or recreational activities, such as agropastoralism, hunting, and ecotourism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoblastomycosis/abstract/1,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16</a>]. Isolation of <em>F. pedrosoi</em> from plant parts responsible for the penetrating trauma that led to chromoblastomycosis has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoblastomycosis/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. In some endemic locations, chromoblastomycosis is considered an occupational disease, primarily affecting workers exposed to contaminated plant materials or soil, such as farm workers and gardeners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoblastomycosis/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. </p><p>The global burden of disease is not precisely known because, like many other endemic mycoses, chromoblastomycosis is not a reportable infectious disease. It is estimated that the incidence ranges from 1:6800 in Madagascar to 1:8,625,000 in the United States. Data from case series indicate that most patients are adult males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoblastomycosis/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. In contrast to phaeohyphomycosis (also caused by melanized fungi), most patients are immunocompetent. Chromoblastomycosis is not an opportunistic infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoblastomycosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2396619901\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Only select species of melanized fungi can survive in the human body after cutaneous penetration and cause clinical manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoblastomycosis/abstract/1,16,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16,28,29</a>]. As with other pathogenic fungi, multiple virulence factors likely play a role in the development of chromoblastomycosis. A unique type of fungal dimorphism that results in a muriform cell architecture, the presence of melanin in the fungal cell wall, hydrophobicity, and cell adhesion are considered particularly important characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoblastomycosis/abstract/1,30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,30-32</a>]. In addition, mechanisms that interfere with the host response may contribute to the persistence of infection. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Muriform cell architecture</strong> &ndash; The muriform cell architecture (brown, round or polyhedral structures) develops after transcutaneous inoculation and resists host defenses, facilitating disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoblastomycosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. They are highly resistant to immune system attack. Ultrastructural examination of muriform cells indicates that some muriform cells consist primarily of storage materials (eg, lipid, glycogen) and few organelles; these features may support the ability of etiologic fungi to remain dormant in tissue for extended periods and resist treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoblastomycosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Other terms used to refer to muriform cells include sclerotic bodies, Medlar bodies, fumagoid bodies, copper pennies, chestnut cells, and meristematic cells. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cell adhesive properties and hydrophobicity</strong> &ndash; Fungal cell adhesive properties and hydrophobicity of fungal elements may support the adherence of fungal elements to host tissue, allowing for the transition to the muriform cell morphology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoblastomycosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Melanin</strong> &ndash; Melanin in fungal cell walls may support evasion of the host immune system. Proposed mechanisms include protection against proteolytic enzymes and oxygen or nitrogen derivatives as well as inhibition of phagocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoblastomycosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Host immune response</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Cutaneous macrophages in association with a cell-mediated immune response play important roles in controlling fungal growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoblastomycosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In immunocompetent hosts, the tissue reaction to fungal infection includes dense granulomatous infiltrates, microabscesses, and tissue proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoblastomycosis/abstract/1,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Genetic factors may influence the ability of the host to resist infection. An increase in the relative risk for chromoblastomycosis has been detected in carriers of HLA-A29 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoblastomycosis/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. In addition, caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 9 (<em>CARD9</em>) mutations favor the development of various fungal infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoblastomycosis/abstract/38-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-42</a>].

Patients may not recall the inciting trauma. Most often, the infection occurs in trauma-prone sites, such as exposed areas of the lower and upper limbs. Involvement of shoulders, trunk, buttocks, eyelids, nose, or ears also has been reported (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F113902\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113902 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoblastomycosis/abstract/1,25,35,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,25,35,43</a>].</p><p>Chromoblastomycosis initially manifests as a solitary, erythematous macule that may evolve to a smooth, pink papule. Verrucous and hyperkeratotic features may subsequently appear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F113889\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113889 \">picture 1I</a>). In the absence of early diagnosis and treatment, lesions can increase in size <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> spread locally, producing satellite lesions. </p><p>The manifestations of progressing disease are polymorphic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoblastomycosis/abstract/1,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,44</a>]. Five morphologies usually occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoblastomycosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nodular:</strong> Moderately elevated, soft, pink or violaceous growth with a smooth, verrucous, or scaly surface (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F113890%7EDERM%2F113904\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113890 graphicRef113904 \">picture 1A, 1F</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Verrucous:</strong> Markedly hyperkeratotic, warty, dry growth; often occurs along the border of the foot (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F113897%7EDERM%2F113903\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113897 graphicRef113903 \">picture 1B, 1G</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tumorous:</strong> Prominent tumor-like masses with papillomatous or lobulated, cauliflower-like morphology, overlying epidermal debris and crusts; often occurs on the lower extremities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F113891\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113891 \">picture 1C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cicatricial:</strong> Flat plaques that expand peripherally with central atrophic scarring; often exhibit annular, arciform, or serpiginous configuration.

Nodular, verrucous, and tumorous presentations are most commonly reported. Patients with advanced disease may have more than one morphology simultaneously (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F113905\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113905 \">picture 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoblastomycosis/abstract/1,25,35,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,25,35,43</a>]. </p><p>Close examination of the surface of lesions often reveals numerous black dots or a &quot;cayenne pepper&quot; appearance. These small elements represent small hematic crusts, pigmented fungal structures, and transepidermal elimination of cellular debris [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoblastomycosis/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].</p><p>In early disease, symptoms are minimal. As the disease progresses, pruritus becomes a dominant complaint and may be accompanied by local pain. </p><p>Spread of the infection is generally limited to the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues. New lesions usually result from contiguous spread <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the infrequent occurrence of lymphatic spread. Because lesions are intensely pruritic, it is thought that scratching may also contribute to cutaneous dissemination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoblastomycosis/abstract/1,25,35,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,25,35,43</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1938323428\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Potential complications of chromoblastomycosis include disabling tissue fibrosis, secondary infection, squamous cell carcinoma, and, rarely, internal organ involvement.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tissue fibrosis</strong> &ndash; The slow, progressive course of chromoblastomycosis results in tissue fibrosis. Fibrotic reactions may also occur in response to the initiation of antifungal therapy. In most cases, the local fibrosis is an irreversible fibrotic process, and it is associated with mature collagen cross-linking due to transglutaminase and lysyl oxidase enzyme activity. These enzymes are detected at the circulating and tissue levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoblastomycosis/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. Potential sequelae include lymphatic blockage, stasis, lymphedema, and elephantiasis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F113906\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113906 \">picture 2</a>). Depending on the site of infection, fibrosis may also lead to complications such as joint immobility and ectropion. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bacterial infection</strong> &ndash; Secondary bacterial infection is a common complication of severe disease and may lead to osteomyelitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoblastomycosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Squamous cell carcinoma</strong> &ndash; There are several reports of squamous cell carcinoma occurring in association with severe chromoblastomycosis. The chronicity of infection and association with bacterial infection and lymphedema may contribute to the development of malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoblastomycosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The time to onset of malignancy has ranged from 5 to 36 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoblastomycosis/abstract/1,50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,50,51</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Internal organ involvement</strong> &ndash; Unlike sporotrichosis and mycetoma, chromoblastomycosis does not compromise deeper structures, such as tendons, muscles, fascia, and osteoarticular sites. Involvement of internal organs is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoblastomycosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Many early reports of chromoblastomycosis involving the brain or lung are now recognized as phaeohyphomycosis rather than chromoblastomycosis infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoblastomycosis/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2440176936\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The possibility of chromoblastomycosis should be suspected in patients with persistent, slow-growing, cutaneous, verrucous or hyperkeratotic papules, nodules, or plaques who live in or traveled to tropical or subtropical regions. Black dots or a &quot;cayenne pepper&quot; appearance on the surface of affected skin is a helpful suggestive clinical feature (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F113895\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113895 \">picture 3</a>).

The most common causative organisms are <em>Fonsecaea pedrosoi</em> and <em>Cladophialophora carrionii</em>. Infection is typically limited to the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue. (See <a href=\"#H2097738058\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chromoblastomycosis most often occurs in tropical or subtropical regions. The causative fungi can be found in soil and plant fragments, and infection usually results from cutaneous trauma. Individuals who engage in outdoor work or recreational activities in endemic areas are at greatest risk for infection. (See <a href=\"#H517733206\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of fungal virulence factors likely contribute to infection, including the ability of causative fungi to acquire a muriform cell architecture in tissue. Muriform cells (also known as sclerotic bodies, Medlar bodies, fumagoid bodies, copper pennies, chestnut cells, and meristematic cells) are resistant to host defenses and facilitate persistence of infection. (See <a href=\"#H2396619901\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical manifestations of chromoblastomycosis are polymorphic. The infection usually begins as an erythematous macule that progresses to verrucous or hyperkeratotic papules, nodules, or plaques (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F113889%7EDERM%2F113890%7EDERM%2F113897%7EDERM%2F113891%7EDERM%2F113899%7EDERM%2F113894\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113889 graphicRef113890 graphicRef113897 graphicRef113891 graphicRef113899 graphicRef113894 \">picture 1A-E, 1I</a>). Pruritus is common and may be accompanied by local pain. Tissue fibrosis, lymphedema, secondary infection, and malignancy are potential complications. Internal organ involvement is rare.

Severe disease is often refractory to treatment. For small, solitary, well-defined lesions, we suggest surgical excision as initial treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For more extensive disease, we suggest oral antifungal therapy rather than surgical excision as initial treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Itraconazole</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=terbinafine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">terbinafine</a> are the most common oral antifungal therapies.
