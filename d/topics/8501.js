A general discussion of fluoroquinolones, including adverse effects other than hypersensitivity reactions, is found separately.

There are several types of hypersensitivity reactions, which are broadly divided into immediate and delayed reactions, based upon the time between administration and the appearance of signs or symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-fluoroquinolones/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Immediate reactions begin within one hour of the first administered dose, and delayed reactions begin later than one hour (and sometimes days) after the first dose. The intent of this classification system is to distinguish immediate reactions from other types, since immediate reactions are more likely to progress to potentially life-threatening anaphylaxis if the patient is re-exposed to the causative drug. Unfortunately, patients often do not recall the chronology of drug reactions, and thus, it is often not possible to classify reactions based on timing alone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-approach-to-the-patient-with-drug-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An approach to the patient with drug allergy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1312189\"><span class=\"h2\">Most common</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two most common types of hypersensitivity reactions to fluoroquinolones are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delayed-onset maculopapular cutaneous eruptions</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">and</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immediate reactions, which are characterized by urticaria, pruritus, flushing, angioedema, wheezing, nausea, abdominal cramping or diarrhea, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypotension</p><p/><p>These two types of fluoroquinolone-induced hypersensitivity reactions are relatively common, and in some studies, the incidence of delayed reactions due to fluoroquinolones is comparable with that due to beta-lactams [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-fluoroquinolones/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The remainder of this topic review will focus on these two forms of hypersensitivity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1312196\"><span class=\"h2\">Other types</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of other uncommon hypersensitivity reactions have been attributed to fluoroquinolones, including fixed drug eruptions, drug fever, vasculitis, serum sickness-like syndromes, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic <span class=\"nowrap\">symptoms/drug-induced</span> hypersensitivity syndrome <span class=\"nowrap\">(DRESS/DiHS),</span> symmetrical drug-related intertriginous and flexural exanthema (SDRIFE), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-fluoroquinolones/abstract/4-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-9</a>]. There is no diagnostic testing for these types of reactions, and avoidance of the causative drug is uniformly recommended.</p><p>SJS and TEN are severe and potentially life-threatening, and any future re-exposure, which can result in recurrence, is contraindicated, except in extreme circumstances. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stevens-johnson-syndrome-and-toxic-epidermal-necrolysis-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The classification and pathogenesis of drug hypersensitivity reactions are reviewed in greater detail separately.

Important questions for the patient with drug allergy are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-approach-to-the-patient-with-drug-allergy#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An approach to the patient with drug allergy&quot;, section on 'Clinical history'</a>.)</p><p>A thorough history of the reaction is essential, since many patients labeled as allergic to fluoroquinolones actually experienced nonallergic adverse reactions, such as tendon inflammation or damage, myalgias, neurologic side effects, or gastrointestinal symptoms. In some cases, such patients should continue to avoid the causative drug, but they are not candidates for allergy evaluation. Nonallergic adverse effects of fluoroquinolones are reviewed elsewhere.

A subset of these patients reacts only to antibiotics. Typically, such patients have reacted to commonly used antibiotics, such as penicillins, sulfonamides, fluoroquinolones, and macrolides and have limited antibiotic options remaining to treat infections. Evaluation of one or more of these antibiotics to determine whether the same or related drugs are actually tolerated can be very helpful in avoiding the use of expensive broad-spectrum antibiotics and in reducing anxiety on the part of the patient and providers. In such individuals, the management goal is the identification of two or more classes of antibiotics that the patient can safely receive, focusing on those that are most clinically useful. Multiple drug allergy syndrome is discussed in more detail elsewhere.

Many patients labeled as allergic to fluoroquinolones experienced nonallergic adverse reactions, such as tendon inflammation or damage, myalgias, neurologic side effects, or gastrointestinal symptoms. In some cases, such patients with adverse reactions should continue to avoid the causative drug, but they are not candidates for allergy evaluation. Nonallergic adverse effects of fluoroquinolones are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoroquinolones#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fluoroquinolones&quot;, section on 'Adverse reactions'</a>.)</p><p>Immediate-type skin testing and challenge procedures are often required in the evaluation of antibiotic hypersensitivity. These procedures should be performed by allergy specialists. Although these procedures are considered safe, they are not without risk and should be performed in a setting prepared to identify and treat possible allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. In addition, any procedure that involves the deliberate exposure of a patient to a substance to which <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> may be allergic should be undertaken by someone with specific training in these techniques.</p><p>Unlike diagnostic tests for penicillin allergy, methods for evaluating fluoroquinolone hypersensitivity are not standardized or validated, and allergy experts may have different approaches to the use of fluoroquinolone skin testing and challenge.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H365986\"><span class=\"h1\">DELAYED MACULOPAPULAR EXANTHEMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common type of reaction to fluoroquinolones is a delayed-onset (defined as greater than one hour after the first administered dose) maculopapular eruption or exanthema that is nonpruritic. Such eruptions occur in 2 to 3 percent of patients treated with fluoroquinolones and are likely mediated by drug-specific T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-fluoroquinolones/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. These reactions are self-limited and generally benign and do <strong>not</strong> feature urticaria, angioedema, fever, systemic symptoms, involvement of the mucous membranes or other organs, or skin desquamation.</p><p>Delayed exanthema may occur with any of the fluoroquinolones, although certain agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemifloxacin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemifloxacin</a>) have particularly high rates, and the incidence is higher with prolonged durations of therapy and possibly in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-fluoroquinolones/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. As an example, the incidence of maculopapular rash in patients treated with gemifloxacin (who were receiving the drug for an infection) ranged from 1.2 percent for 5-day therapy to 7.4 percent for 14-day therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-fluoroquinolones/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Women &lt;40 years old were found to have a higher incidence of exanthema compared with other groups of patients (2.1 and 22.6 percent for 5- and 14-day therapy, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-fluoroquinolones/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6129542\"><span class=\"h2\">Cross-reactivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of an exanthema with one fluoroquinolone does not necessarily predict recurrence with others. One of the most illustrative studies about delayed cutaneous eruptions to fluoroquinolones was an unpublished double-blind, double-dummy, crossover study conducted in healthy female volunteers &lt;40 years old (not in need of antibiotic therapy), treated with 10 days of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemifloxacin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemifloxacin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-fluoroquinolones/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This study specifically focused on younger women and was described in a review but has not been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-fluoroquinolones/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the first part of the study, rashes developed in a total of 260 of 819 (32 percent) and 7 of 164 (4.3 percent) of women treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemifloxacin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemifloxacin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> for 10 days, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-fluoroquinolones/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The vast majority of the rashes were maculopapular, and the most common finding on biopsy was uncomplicated exanthem (mild superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate). There was no evidence of vasculitis, bulla formation, or necrosis. Blood and urine tests were unremarkable, with no eosinophilia, hepatitis, or other abnormalities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the second part of the same study, the 260 women who developed exanthema to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemifloxacin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemifloxacin</a> were given <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a>, and only 10.4 percent developed a rash [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-fluoroquinolones/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. It is unknown whether this low degree of cross-reactivity between gemifloxacin and ciprofloxacin can be generalized to other combinations of fluoroquinolones. Interestingly, some women who initially tolerated ciprofloxacin for 10 days went on to develop a rash when treatment was repeated for another 10 days.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4093130\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Discontinuation of the culprit fluoroquinolone is the primary treatment for maculopapular exanthema. The median time to resolution of the rash is five days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-fluoroquinolones/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], and symptoms may worsen for a few days, even after the drug is stopped [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-fluoroquinolones/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Oral antihistamines may be administered at age-appropriate doses if there is a pruritic component. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exanthematous-maculopapular-drug-eruption#H14870405\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exanthematous (maculopapular) drug eruption&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H365993\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After resolution of an exanthema to a fluoroquinolone, evaluation is appropriate, although there is a lack of consensus about the best approach. In the United States, these reactions are usually diagnosed based upon the clinical history (and physical findings if the reaction is witnessed by a clinician). Photographs or detailed descriptions in the medical record are invaluable for future reference. Further evaluation is not usually performed.</p><p>The largest study to undertake challenge of patients with history of delayed reactions to fluoroquinolones evaluated 66 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-fluoroquinolones/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. No skin testing was performed, and all of the historical reactions occurred less than one year prior to evaluation. Upon being challenged with the same quinolone that caused the previous reaction, 63 of 66 patients tolerated the antibiotic.</p><p>Patch testing for the evaluation of delayed maculopapular exanthema from fluoroquinolones is <strong>not</strong> useful. In a study of 101 patients with fluoroquinolone allergy, 37 had delayed reactions (defined in this study as symptoms appearing greater than six hours after the last dose) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-fluoroquinolones/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Approximately one-half of these reactions began within 24 hours of the first dose. All 37 patients underwent patch testing, and all had negative results. Twenty-eight underwent fluoroquinolone graded challenges with the culprit drug, and two patients reacted with recurrence exanthema, both after the fourth dose. Thus, patch testing was not helpful for identifying patients at risk for this type of reaction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H366000\"><span class=\"h3\">Graded challenge</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since cross-reactivity among fluoroquinolones for delayed maculopapular reactions appears to be low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-fluoroquinolones/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], it is reasonable to perform graded challenge in patients with a history of a self-limited maculopapular exanthema, with a fluoroquinolone different from the one that caused the reaction. However, it is important to understand the limitations of challenge procedures for delayed maculopapular exanthema. Many of these reactions only recur after several days of therapy, and there is no practical way to elicit such reactions without administering a full therapeutic course. This should be explained to patients.</p><p>The author's approach to challenge in this setting is to administer <span class=\"nowrap\">1/10<sup>th</sup></span> of a full dose, wait one hour, and if there is no adverse reaction, then administer the remaining <span class=\"nowrap\">9/10<sup>ths</sup></span> of the dose and observe for an additional hour. The primary rationale for giving the initial dose under observation is to reassure the patient that the drug can be safely ingested. Otherwise, there may be continued reluctance to use it in the future. A delayed reaction may occur during the 24 hours following the initial dose, and patients should be instructed to inform the clinician if this occurs. In the study mentioned previously, 28 patients with delayed reactions were challenged, and the two who reacted developed symptoms at 15 and 20 hours after the last of the graded doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-fluoroquinolones/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>After receiving a full dose under observation, patients who do not need the antibiotic at that time can simply take it normally in the future. Patients who need fluoroquinolone therapy at the time can continue the treatment for a full course.</p><p>If a patient develops a mild exanthema during future courses of therapy, it may be reasonable to attempt to continue the drug and add antihistamine therapy, provided that the reaction lacks any worrisome features. This approach has not been formally studied and is only appropriate when the benefit of continued treatment clearly outweighs the risk of further reaction. Such situations require clinical judgement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exanthematous-maculopapular-drug-eruption#H14870405\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exanthematous (maculopapular) drug eruption&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6129585\"><span class=\"h1\">REACTIONS OF UNCERTAIN TYPE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a previous reaction to a fluoroquinolone was poorly documented, if the clinical history is uncertain, or if the reaction involved a pruritic skin component, then the possibility of an immediate reaction should be considered. (See <a href=\"#H2118347\" class=\"local\">'Immediate reactions'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2118347\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMEDIATE REACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immediate reactions are characterized by symptoms that begin within one hour of the first administered dose. Immediate reactions result from activation of mast cells and basophils. Common signs and symptoms include urticaria, pruritus, flushing, angioedema of the face, extremities, or laryngeal tissues (leading to throat tightness with stridor or rarely, asphyxiation), wheezing, nausea, abdominal cramping or diarrhea, hypotension, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anaphylactic shock. Fatal immediate reactions to fluoroquinolones have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-fluoroquinolones/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6129656\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is evidence for both immunoglobulin E (IgE) and non-IgE mechanisms for immediate reactions caused by fluoroquinolones. Animal studies have shown that fluoroquinolones at supratherapeutic doses can cause histamine release <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> generalized rash [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-fluoroquinolones/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Unlike IgE-mediated allergic reactions, non-IgE-mediated reactions may occur with first exposure, since prior sensitization is not necessary. Apart from this difference, IgE-mediated and non-IgE-mediated reactions may be clinically indistinguishable, and their relative incidence is not known.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6129663\"><span class=\"h2\">IgE-mediated reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is very limited evidence of fluoroquinolone-specific IgE in patients with past immediate reactions. In the most convincing study, fluoroquinolone-specific IgE was detected in 30 of 55 patients by radioimmunoassay (RIA), although at very low levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-fluoroquinolones/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Inhibition studies were performed to demonstrate that the IgE was functional, although only on a few sera.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6129670\"><span class=\"h3\">Natural history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is some evidence that fluoroquinolone-specific IgE declines over time, implying that some patients could lose the allergy if not re-exposed for a period of time. In the study (mentioned above) of 55 patients with convincing histories of immediate-type reactions to fluoroquinolones occurring 1 to 48 months prior to evaluation, 30 of the 55 had detectable drug-specific IgE by RIA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-fluoroquinolones/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In those patients who had detectable drug-specific IgE, an average of 9.7 months had elapsed since the reaction, compared with 15.6 months in those without detectable IgE. Also, among the 30 IgE-positive patients, those with recent reactions (defined as less than eight months prior to evaluation) had significantly higher RIA values than those with more distant reactions. Although none of the patients were challenged with fluoroquinolones to confirm allergic status, these data suggest that fluoroquinolone allergy will eventually resolve in some patients.</p><p>Based on a small number of studies of patients with immediate reactions to fluoroquinolones who underwent graded challenge with the <strong>culprit</strong> drug, most patients, in fact, tolerated the drug upon re-exposure. Unfortunately, the time elapsed between the reaction and challenge was not specified in two of these studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-fluoroquinolones/abstract/5,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,22,23</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 33 patients who were evaluated only with challenge, 24 tolerated the culprit drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-fluoroquinolones/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

The median time elapsed between reaction and evaluation was not specified.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 152 patients, a basophil activation test (BAT) was performed, and only those patients with negative BAT results were challenged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-fluoroquinolones/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Skin testing was not performed. Twenty-four patients had a positive BAT and were not challenged. The remaining 128 patients underwent graded challenge with the culprit fluoroquinolone and 42 reacted. Therefore, a total of 66 of 152 (43 percent) of the patients were confirmed to be allergic (42 via challenge and 24 via positive BAT). This is a surprisingly low value, given that all of the patients had a convincing reaction history less than one year prior to evaluation, and about one-half of the historical reactions were anaphylaxis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10730700\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fluoroquinolone-induced anaphylactic reactions are increasingly reported, although the incidence is not precisely known [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-fluoroquinolones/abstract/5,21,24-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,21,24-28</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of these reactions was estimated to be between 1 and 5 per 100,000 prescriptions filled in a large Unites States health insurance claims database, in which anaphylaxis was confirmed by review of medical records [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-fluoroquinolones/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The rates for anaphylaxis to penicillins and cephalosporins were comparable (2 of 100,000 and 1 of 100,000, respectively).

It is the author's approach to advise patients with positive results to avoid all fluoroquinolones because of possible cross-reactivity among fluoroquinolones in causing immediate reactions. If the patient requires treatment with that fluoroquinolone and there are no acceptable antibiotic alternatives, it should be administered via a rapid desensitization.

History-positive patients with negative fluoroquinolone skin testing should undergo graded challenge as described in the next section.

Negative fluoroquinolone skin testing should be followed by graded challenge in order to confirm lack of allergy (or if the challenge is positive, to demonstrate that the skin test was falsely negative). Otherwise, patients or other clinicians may misinterpret the skin test result to mean that fluoroquinolone allergy has been conclusively ruled out, which is not the case.</p><p>Because of the uncertain utility of skin testing with fluoroquinolones, another option for evaluating patients with immediate reactions is to forego skin testing and perform a graded challenge with a fluoroquinolone other than the one that caused the reaction. The author's approach is to challenge with an alternate equally efficacious fluoroquinolone, since cross-reactivity is about 50 percent based on a limited number of challenges reported in the literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-fluoroquinolones/abstract/25,26,31,32,34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26,31,32,34-36</a>].

The degree of caution exercised is determined by the severity of the historical reaction and the time elapsed since the reaction. For example, an outpatient graded challenge with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levofloxacin</a> for a patient with immediate urticaria in the past could be carried out under continuous supervision with 5 mg, 50 mg, and then 500 mg of levofloxacin (oral solution), each given one hour apart.

Desensitization alters a patient's adverse immune response to a drug and results in <strong>temporary</strong> tolerance, allowing the patient with a hypersensitivity reaction to receive an uninterrupted course of the medication safely. Once the medication is discontinued, the patient's hypersensitivity to the medication returns.

Referral to an allergy expert is appropriate if the patient has experienced a serious reaction, has an underlying medical condition that will likely require fluoroquinolone therapy in the future, or reports multiple drug allergies and has limited drug options left. (See <a href=\"#H10729855\" class=\"local\">'Approach to the patient'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluoroquinolones cause a delayed-onset maculopapular, nonpruritic rash in 2 to 3 percent of patients. These reactions are likely mediated by drug-specific T cells. In most cases, no specific testing is useful. Cross-reactivity among the fluoroquinolones for this type of reaction appears to be low. For patients who require fluoroquinolone therapy in the future, we suggest identifying a safe alternative using a graded challenge with a fluoroquinolone, other than the one that caused the reaction (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).

There is evidence of cross-reactivity among fluoroquinolones in patients with immediate reactions, but no clear patterns have been distinguished. Diagnostic tests for immediate fluoroquinolone hypersensitivity are not validated or standardized, in contrast to tests for penicillin hypersensitivity. If skin testing is performed, it is critical to use nonirritating concentrations of the drugs in question, since fluoroquinolones can cause irritant false-positive reactions. (See <a href=\"#H2118347\" class=\"local\">'Immediate reactions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that patients with anaphylaxis in the recent past (ie, &lt;5 years) empirically avoid all fluoroquinolones (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We do not perform skin testing or challenge in such patients. If a fluoroquinolone is absolutely required in the near future, it should be administered using a desensitization protocol.
