The minimum effective dialysis dose is typically determined by measuring small solute clearance. Common methods used to measure small solute clearance include urea clearance normalized to total body water <span class=\"nowrap\">(Kt/Vurea)</span> and the peritoneal creatinine clearance (CCr) normalized to body surface area (BSA). Both <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> and CCr utilize clearance of a surrogate solute (ie, urea or creatinine, respectively) to estimate overall small solute clearance.</p><p>The weekly <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> is now the preferred method for measuring small solute clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-solute-clearance-in-continuous-peritoneal-dialysis-kt-v-and-creatinine-clearance/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. However, the CCr may still be used in some areas. Although the <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> and peritoneal CCr usually correlate, they are occasionally discrepant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-solute-clearance-in-continuous-peritoneal-dialysis-kt-v-and-creatinine-clearance/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p>This topic reviews methods of measuring solute clearance in peritoneal dialysis, including the <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> and the CCr.</p><p>An overview of prescribing an adequate amount of peritoneal dialysis and the mechanism of solute clearance by peritoneal dialysis are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescribing and assessing adequate peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-solute-clearance-and-ultrafiltration-in-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of solute clearance and ultrafiltration in peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20373652\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS AND CALCULATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The daily <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> is calculated from the daily urea clearance (Kt), which is the sum of the product of all drain volumes (peritoneal and residual kidney) and the ratio of the urea concentration in the pooled, drained dialysate or urine to that in the plasma <span class=\"nowrap\">(D/P</span> urea). Kt is normalized to total body water, which is the volume of distribution of urea (V). V may be estimated from published formulas such as the Watson formula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-solute-clearance-in-continuous-peritoneal-dialysis-kt-v-and-creatinine-clearance/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In general, V is approximately equal to 60 percent of ideal body weight for men and 55 percent ideal body weight for women. In practice, most centers use a kinetic modeling program to determine V and <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V,</span> although the <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> may be manually calculated from the serum urea, pooled dialysate urea, total drain volume, and estimated V. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescribing and assessing adequate peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Calculation of the peritoneal CCr is similar to that for the <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span>. The mean daily drain volume (peritoneal and residual kidney) is multiplied by the ratio of total dialysate and urine creatinine to the serum creatinine <span class=\"nowrap\">(D/P</span> creatinine). Clearance is normalized to 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> body surface area (BSA), estimated by the Dubois formula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-solute-clearance-in-continuous-peritoneal-dialysis-kt-v-and-creatinine-clearance/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Both calculations measure total clearance of either urea or creatinine. In order to determine the residual renal component of the total clearance, a 24-hour urine collection is performed. When the CCr is calculated, we estimated the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from the average of the urea and CCr. This is because CCr alone typically overestimates the GFR since creatinine is not only filtered but also secreted into the tubules. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculation-of-the-creatinine-clearance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Calculation of the creatinine clearance&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Both the <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> and CCr are expressed as weekly values; thus, the total daily values are multiplied by 7.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20373863\"><span class=\"h1\">CORRELATION BETWEEN Kt/VUREA AND CREATININE CLEARANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most peritoneal dialysis patients, <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> and CCr correlate fairly well. In some patients, there is discrepancy between <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> and CCr. The correlation between <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> and CCr is affected by three factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The relative contribution of residual renal function to total solute clearance</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The rate of peritoneal transport, which varies between patients</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extremes of weight in either direction (ie, malnourished or obese patients)</p><p/><p>The relation between total urea clearance and CCr reflects the sum of the renal and dialysis clearances.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ratio of CCr to <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> tends to be higher in patients who have significant residual renal function. Significant residual renal function is common when peritoneal dialysis is first initiated. A commonly used historical reference value is the ratio of <span class=\"nowrap\">CCr/Kt/V</span> of <span class=\"nowrap\">60/2</span>.0 = 30.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient's ratio of CCr to <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> falls as the patient becomes anuric.</p><p/><p>These differences are illustrated in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F71878\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71878 \">figure 1</a>), which shows total solute clearance represented by both <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> and CCr over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-solute-clearance-in-continuous-peritoneal-dialysis-kt-v-and-creatinine-clearance/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In this study, CCr from residual renal function fell from 3.9 to 1.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> by two years. At the latter value (1.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> equals 14 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/week),</span> residual renal function continued to account for 23 percent of total CCr.</p><p>The effects of residual renal function, peritoneal transport, and extremes of weight are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Residual renal function and solute clearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As in any form of renal replacement therapy, total solute removal consists of the removal of the solute in question by both dialysis and residual renal clearance. In peritoneal dialysis, it is standard to use total solute removal as a measure of dialysis adequacy. This is different from the standard practice in hemodialysis, in which only the dialysis clearance of a solute is used to measure dialysis adequacy.</p><p>Residual renal function has historically been included in total clearance for peritoneal dialysis for the following reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Studies that defined peritoneal dialysis adequacy used total solute clearance. Most clinicians used the same practice in order for studies to inform clinical practice.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It was considered relatively easy for peritoneal dialysis patients to provide 24-hour urine collections to the dialysis center since they were already providing 24-hour peritoneal dialysis effluent drain volumes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Residual renal function is often preserved in peritoneal dialysis patients but not in hemodialysis patients. As a result, residual renal function contributes a greater proportion to total clearance and typically for longer periods of time.</p><p/><p>The contribution of renal clearance should not be ignored when calculating total solute clearance, since increasing the amount of peritoneal dialysis to meet minimum target values may unnecessarily increase the burden of dialysis for the patient. This important issue is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescribing and assessing adequate peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis#H649141901\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescribing and assessing adequate peritoneal dialysis&quot;, section on 'Solute clearance provided by residual renal function'</a>.)</p><p>Like all solutes, creatinine and urea are cleared at specific rates by both peritoneal dialysis and by the kidney (ie, residual renal function). The differences in individual clearances underlie the occasional discrepancy when <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> and CCr are used to determine dialysis adequacy.</p><p>The residual CCr is an overestimate and the urea clearance is an underestimate of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). This is because renal clearance is the sum total of glomerular filtration and net tubular secretion or reabsorption. Both creatinine and urea are freely filtered. However, whereas creatinine is also secreted by the tubule, urea is reabsorbed. As a result, tubular function increases the total CCr and decreases the total urea clearance. Since both creatinine and urea are surrogate solutes, CCr overestimates and urea clearance underestimates renal solute clearance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H118793088\"><span class=\"h2\">Peritoneal clearance of solute</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Peritoneal clearance of solute is primarily by diffusion, although there is also a small contribution from convection due to ultrafiltration. The rate of clearance of any solute by diffusion is inversely related to the size of the solute. Since urea is a smaller molecule than creatinine, the peritoneal clearance of urea tends to be greater than that of creatinine.</p><p>Peritoneal membrane transport characteristics may affect the relative clearances of various solutes.</p><p>As mentioned above, the diffusive clearance for urea is relatively greater than that for creatinine. Thus, for shorter dwells, the urea clearance per dwell tends to exceed that for creatinine.</p><p>This is most pronounced in patients who are low transporters. In such patients, the ratio of CCr to <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> is typically lower than in high (rapid) transporters (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-transporters-on-maintenance-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid transporters on maintenance peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a>). During the typical dwells associated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), the dialysate to plasma ratio <span class=\"nowrap\">(D/P)</span> for urea tends to be near unity (equilibration between blood and dialysate) in all patients, whereas the <span class=\"nowrap\">D/P</span> for creatinine may approach unity only in high transporters (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F62604\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62604 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>The net effect is that the weekly <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> in peritoneal dialysis patients is relatively independent of transporter type, while the weekly CCr falls progressively from high to low transporters (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F56884\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56884 \">figure 3</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-solute-clearance-in-continuous-peritoneal-dialysis-kt-v-and-creatinine-clearance/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>These relationships were illustrated in a study of 309 anuric CAPD patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-solute-clearance-in-continuous-peritoneal-dialysis-kt-v-and-creatinine-clearance/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> and the CCr were correlated to each other and with the peritoneal solute transport characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-solute-clearance-in-continuous-peritoneal-dialysis-kt-v-and-creatinine-clearance/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Weekly <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> values were similar in the low, low-average, high-average, and high transport groups: 1.74, 1.66, 1.68, and 1.73, respectively. By comparison, the ratios of (non-normalized) peritoneal creatinine to peritoneal urea clearance in the low, low-average, high-average, and high transport groups were 0.65, 0.76, 0.84, and 0.91, respectively.</p><p>It is important to be aware of individual patients' peritoneal membrane transport characteristics when writing the peritoneal dialysis prescription and interpreting solute clearance results. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescribing and assessing adequate peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Weight and normalization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient weight has a greater effect on <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> than on CCr. A decrease or increase in weight causes the <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> to increase or decrease, respectively. As a result of this relationship, the <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> is often at or above target values in malnourished patients and low in obese patients if the actual (rather than ideal) body weight is used. This is the reason that, for calculating solute clearance, use of the ideal body weight is preferred to the actual weight.</p><p>The difference in the effect of weight on <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> and CCr is related to different methods used to normalize total clearance of urea and creatinine. As noted above, the urea clearance (Kt) and the CCr are normalized by V (volume of distribution) and 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> body surface area (BSA), respectively. The effect of the patient's weight on this normalization is greater for <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> than it is for CCr. This becomes most pronounced in malnourished and obese patients. If V is derived from the Watson formula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-solute-clearance-in-continuous-peritoneal-dialysis-kt-v-and-creatinine-clearance/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] and BSA from the Dubois formula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-solute-clearance-in-continuous-peritoneal-dialysis-kt-v-and-creatinine-clearance/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], the calculations are as follows:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;V (L, male) &#160;= &#160;2.447 &#160;+ &#160;(0.3362 &#160;x &#160;wt [kg]) &#160;+ &#160;(0.1074 &#160;x &#160;Ht [cm]) &#160;- &#160;(0.09516 &#160;x &#160;age [years])</p></div></div><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;V (L, female) &#160;= &#160;-2.097 &#160;+ &#160;(0.2466 &#160;x &#160;wt [kg]) &#160;+ &#160;(0.1069 x Ht [cm])</p></div></div><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;BSA &#160;= &#160;0.007184 &#160;x &#160;body wt [kg](0.425) &#160;x &#160;Ht [cm](0.725)</p></div></div><p>In the BSA calculation, the numbers 0.425 and 0.725 represent the exponential power of the body weight and height, respectively.</p><p>It can be appreciated from these equations that weight has a relatively greater impact on the value for V than for BSA. This is illustrated in the figure, which compares <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> and CCr values for anuric males and females on 8 liters of therapy per day (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F81472\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81472 \">figure 4</a>). The <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> is higher in females compared with males, while there is little difference in the weekly CCr.</p><p>The effect of normalization also varies with the state of nutrition. In malnourished patients, the decrease in weight causes a decrease in V, while Kt is unchanged; thus, the <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> will tend to increase. This is one reason why one often finds a <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> value that is near or above target in malnourished patients. If, in this setting, the ideal body weight was used in the calculation, the <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> would not be as close to target as when actual weights are used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F78283\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78283 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The situation is reversed in obese patients. In obese patients who are eating well, feeling well, and have normal serum albumin concentrations, using the actual weight in the calculation often results in what appears to be low <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> and CCr values; substituting the ideal weight results in clearance values more predictive of their nutritional status (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F78283\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78283 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18390890\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The minimum effective dialysis dose is determined by measuring small solute clearance.
