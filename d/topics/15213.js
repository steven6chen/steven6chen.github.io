Of the acute leukemias, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) occurs five times more commonly than acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Survival rates for ALL have improved dramatically since the 1980s, with a current five-year overall survival rate estimated at greater than 85 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-group-stratification-and-prognosis-for-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. This improvement in survival is due to treatment of a large number of children on sequential standardized research protocols. Approximately 75 to 80 percent of children with newly diagnosed ALL participate in such trials, the goals of which are to improve clinical outcomes while minimizing acute toxicities and late-occurring adverse events.</p><p>The risk group stratification for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children will be reviewed here.
