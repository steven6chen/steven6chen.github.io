Although pediatric hypernatremia is an uncommon electrolyte abnormality, there can be significant neurologic injury in patients with severe hypernatremia, especially those with acute and rapid changes in serum sodium.</p><p>The etiology, clinical findings, diagnosis, and evaluation of pediatric hypernatremia are reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H536507079\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The true incidence of pediatric hypernatremia is unknown, as published data are based on hospitalized children.</p><p>As an example, a Scottish study reported an overall incidence of hypernatremia (defined as a plasma sodium &gt;150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> of 0.04 percent for all pediatric hospitalizations in pediatric patients over two weeks of age over a study period from 1996 to 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypernatremia-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, the risk of hypernatremia was 10 times greater in neonates less than two weeks of age, with an incidence of 0.4 percent. Neonatal hypernatremia was almost exclusively seen in breastfed infants with excessive weight (water loss). Of note, the incidence of neonatal hypernatremia in breastfed infants was higher than reported in previous studies (0.03 to 0.07 percent) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initiation-of-breastfeeding#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initiation of breastfeeding&quot;, section on 'Excessive weight loss'</a>). In older patients between two weeks and 17 years of age, the most common cause of hypernatremia on admission was excess water loss due to gastroenteritis or systemic infection. However, in this cohort, it was more common for hypernatremia to develop during hospitalization, particularly in patients with systemic infection or those who underwent cardiac surgery. In addition, approximately one-third of the patients had an underlying neurologic condition.</p><p>In an earlier study from a tertiary children's hospital in Texas from 1992 to 1994, hypernatremia (defined as a serum sodium greater than 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> was detected in 1.4 percent of sodium values in a laboratory database, but only 0.2 percent of patients were discharged with a diagnosis of hyperosmolality due to hypernatremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypernatremia-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Of the 68 children with a final discharge diagnosis of <span class=\"nowrap\">hyperosmolality/hypernatremia,</span> two-thirds of the children developed hypernatremia during hospitalization, and the most common cause of hypernatremia was inadequate fluid intake.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H536507266\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypernatremia is caused by an imbalance in the body's handling of water, resulting in a relative excess of effective plasma osmolality (tonicity) to total body water. The plasma tonicity is defined as the concentration of solutes that do not easily cross the cell membrane, which is primarily due to sodium salts in the extracellular space. As a result, serum or plasma sodium is used as a surrogate for assessing tonicity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-disorders-of-water-balance-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-and-sodium-balance-hypovolemia-and-edema#H37261099\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of disorders of water balance (hyponatremia and hypernatremia) and sodium balance (hypovolemia and edema)&quot;, section on 'Plasma tonicity'</a>.)</p><p>The formulas used to estimate plasma tonicity are similar to those for the plasma osmolality, with the one exception that the contribution of urea (an ineffective osmole) is not included. The multiplier factor of &quot;2&quot; accounts for the osmotic contributions of the anions that accompany sodium, the primary extracellular cation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plasma tonicity = 2 x [Na] + <span class=\"nowrap\">[glucose]/18</span> (if glucose is measured in <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plasma tonicity = 2 x [Na] + [glucose] (if glucose is measured in <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span></p><p/><p>Plasma tonicity is tightly regulated by the release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from the posterior pituitary promoting water retention, and by thirst-prompting water ingestion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F65195\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65195 \">figure 1</a>). These homeostatic mechanisms that mediate plasma tonicity and water balance are similar in adults and children, resulting in a normal range of plasma sodium between 135 and 145 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> that does not vary by age. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-disorders-of-water-balance-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-and-sodium-balance-hypovolemia-and-edema#H96014898\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of disorders of water balance (hyponatremia and hypernatremia) and sodium balance (hypovolemia and edema)&quot;, section on 'Regulation of plasma tonicity'</a>.)</p><p>Hypernatremia is most often caused by the failure to replace water losses, which, in children, are most commonly due to gastrointestinal fluid loss. In these patients, the sodium plus potassium concentration in the fluid that is lost is <strong>less</strong> than the plasma sodium concentration. As a result, water is lost in excess of sodium plus potassium, which will tend to <strong>increase</strong> the plasma sodium concentration. In individuals with intact thirst mechanisms, the intake of free water promptly corrects any increase in plasma sodium. However, when water losses cannot be replaced because of a lack of free access to water, excessive loss in acute illnesses, or impaired thirst mechanism, sodium concentration increases and may result in hypernatremia. Infants and children who are significantly neurodevelopmentally impaired are at particular risk for hypernatremia, as they may be unable to communicate their thirst and are dependent on others for fluid repletion. Pediatric hypernatremia also may result from urinary or skin loss of free water without adequate water replacement.</p><p>Less commonly, pediatric hypernatremia may be caused by intake of sodium in excess of water (eg, administration of a hypertonic salt solution). In this setting, patients also are unable to access free water to correct the plasma tonicity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1304699208\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The causes of pediatric hypernatremia can be separated into the two previously discussed mechanisms that result in pediatric hypernatremia (see <a href=\"#H536507266\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Water loss that is not replaced</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive salt intake relative to water ingestion</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1304699334\"><span class=\"h2\">Excess water losses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Loss of body fluids with a sodium plus potassium concentration that is less than serum or plasma sodium (hypotonic fluids) will result in an increase in sodium concentration if the water losses are <strong>not</strong> replaced. Sources of hypotonic body fluid losses include gastrointestinal fluids, dilute urine, and skin loss due to sweat or burns. In addition, inadequate water intake that fails to replace ongoing normal fluid losses will result in excess water loss and increases in serum or plasma sodium.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1304699215\"><span class=\"h3\">Gastrointestinal loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children, the most common cause of hypernatremia is hypotonic gastrointestinal losses without replacement, which result in effective water loss. In particular, gastroenteritis due to rotavirus can present with profuse watery diarrhea and hypernatremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypernatremia-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In addition, losses due to vomiting or nasogastric drainage can lead to excess free water loss and hypernatremia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H192147411\"><span class=\"h3\">Urinary water loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excessive urinary free water loss may be caused by disorders with impaired urinary concentration (eg, diabetes insipidus [DI]) or osmotic diuresis. Without adequate water replacement, sodium concentration will rise and may result in hypernatremia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F88819\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88819 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H536507457\"><span class=\"h4\">Urinary concentration defects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Impaired urinary concentration is typically due to antidiuretic hormone (ADH) deficiency or resistance, which leads to excretion of a dilute urine (urine osmolality less than plasma osmolality) and excessive urinary free water loss.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central DI &ndash;<em> </em>Central DI is caused by inadequate production or release of ADH. Central DI has multiple etiologies, including congenital central nervous system (CNS) malformations and genetic syndromes with associated CNS anomalies, and acquired causes due to CNS tumors, infiltrative processes of the hypothalamic-pituitary stalk, and sequelae from neurosurgery and trauma.

The multiple causes of pediatric nephrogenic DI can be further divided into the following categories (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and causes of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus&quot;, section on 'Causes'</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Congenital nephrogenic DI &ndash; Congenital nephrogenic DI is most often the result of mutations in the vasopressin type 2 receptor (<em>AVPR2</em>), found at the locus Xp28. In this X-linked disorder, male infants typically present in the first weeks of life with fussiness, low-grade fever, and polyuria with hypernatremia. In addition, hereditary nephrogenic DI may be caused by a mutation in the aquaporin-2 gene (<em>AQP2</em>) at 12q13, which encodes the ADH-sensitive water channels. Congenital nephrogenic DI is also observed in other inherited disorders, including Bardet-Biedl and Bartter syndromes, nephronophthisis, cystinosis, and familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Acquired nephrogenic DI &ndash; Drug toxicity is the most common cause of acquired DI. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Lithium</a> toxicity is the most frequent cause of drug-induced nephrogenic DI, and its use has increased in children and adolescents with mood disorders. Lithium also can cause interstitial nephritis and fibrosis, further exacerbating urinary concentrating capacity. The effects of lithium on urinary concentrating ability can be permanent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-toxicity-of-lithium#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal toxicity of lithium&quot;, section on 'Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Other medications associated with drug-induced nephrogenic DI include amphotericin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=demeclocycline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">demeclocycline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ifosfamide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ifosfamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=foscarnet-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">foscarnet</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cidofovir-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cidofovir</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Hypercalcemia and hypokalemia also can produce functional defects in water reabsorption that are usually reversible once the electrolyte perturbation resolves.

In these disorders, the decline in urinary concentrating ability may be due to a number of different factors, including resistance to ADH, impairment of the renal medulla countercurrent mechanism, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> decrease in the number of functioning nephrons, which can lead to osmotic diuresis as the ability to reabsorb the increasing solute load is exceeded.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H536509723\"><span class=\"h4\">Osmotic diuresis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypernatremia can also occur from urinary water losses due to renal excretion of nonelectrolyte, nonreabsorbed solutes, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">mannitol</a> or glucose (eg, patients with diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemia). While the urine osmolality is augmented with the presence of these substances, the urinary concentration of sodium plus potassium is below plasma levels. If there is inadequate water repletion, the enhanced urinary free water loss leads to an increase in sodium concentration, and potentially hypernatremia.

However, with vigorous or sustained exercise, or significant febrile illness, water losses from sweat can become more substantial and can result in hypernatremia if not corrected with water intake. Increased insensible water losses due to burns can also lead to hypernatremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypernatremia-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Infants and young children are especially susceptible due to their inability to communicate their thirst, and their reliance on others for access to water. A teaspoon of salt contains 100 mEq of sodium (Na), which can increase the serum sodium concentration in a 10 kg child by 17 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. The unpleasant salty taste of such preparations should limit their voluntary ingestion, but in situations of intentional poisoning these children are often subjected to limited access to other fluids, thereby ensuring the ingestion of the hypertonic preparations.</p><p>Salt poisoning causes a rapid onset of hypernatremia, often resulting in cerebral hemorrhage and irreversible neurologic injury. Osmotic demyelination can occur, similar to the injury caused by a rapid elevation in serum sodium in patients with chronic hyponatremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypernatremia-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Many pediatric patients also have a concurrent volume isotonic deficit usually due to gastrointestinal losses. Such patients with hypernatremia will require replacement of <strong>both</strong> water and electrolyte deficits. In these patients, it is important to assess the volume status as in the setting of significant hypovolemia, because in patients with moderate to severe hypovolemia, fluid resuscitation with isotonic fluid to restore intravascular volume and tissue perfusion takes precedence over correction of the hypernatremia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypovolemia-dehydration-in-children#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypovolemia (dehydration) in children&quot;, section on 'Emergent fluid repletion phase'</a>.)</p><p>In cases where hypernatremia alone is the primary abnormality, therapy is aimed at correcting the plasma sodium by providing free water and determining a rate of desired correction.

In patients with moderate to severe hypovolemia, emergent fluid resuscitation with isotonic fluid is administered to restore intravascular volume and tissue perfusion. However, overzealous fluid resuscitation needs to be avoided to prevent inadvertent volume overload, which may be associated with cerebral edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypernatremia-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypovolemia-dehydration-in-children#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypovolemia (dehydration) in children&quot;, section on 'Emergent fluid repletion phase'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H192147418\"><span class=\"h2\">Calculating the free water deficit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With the restoration of effective intra-arterial volume, or in cases where there is no need for urgent volume expansion, the focus turns to providing the fluid necessary to correct any existing hypovolemia, and enough free water to correct the hypernatremia.</p><p>The volume of free water to be provided can be calculated using one of two common approaches:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Free water deficit in milliliters = Current total body water x ([current plasma <span class=\"nowrap\">Na/140]</span> - 1)</p><p/><p>For this equation, estimating total body water (TBW) as 60 percent of the child's weight in kilograms (0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/kg)</span> is a reasonable starting point for the purposes of calculating fluid replacement. The exact proportion varies as a child progresses from infancy to adolescence, and is lower in obese individuals (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56512\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56512 \">figure 2</a>). Thus, in a 6 kg infant with a plasma sodium of 160, the free water deficit is: (0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/kg)</span> x (6 kg) x <span class=\"nowrap\">([160/140]</span> &ndash; 1) = 0.51 liters or 510 mL.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Free water deficit in liters = (4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg)</span> x (weight in kg) x (desired change in plasma Na)</p><p/><p>This approach uses the estimate that the provision of 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of free water will lower plasma sodium by approximately 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. For the 6 kg infant described above with plasma sodium elevated 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> above desired, his or her water deficit would be: (4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg)</span> x (6 kg) x (20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> change) = 480 mL.</p><p>The variation in free water needed between the two calculations is generally clinically negligible and, in any case, the equations are used as estimates with follow-up laboratory results and clinical exams guiding ongoing changes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H733673763\"><span class=\"h3\">Prescribed fluid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Free water calculations provide for an estimate of the amount of water without sodium needed to return plasma sodium to a normal concentration. However, in most clinical settings, the administered fluid typically contains sodium, but is hypotonic to the patient's plasma, thereby providing free water. As an example, the 500 mL free water deficit in the example above could be delivered with the administration of 1 liter of 0.45 percent saline. In addition, normal saline (0.9 percent saline) is isotonic in patients with normal plasma sodium; however, it is a hypotonic fluid for children with hypernatremia, and accordingly can be used as initial rehydration fluid for patients with hypernatremic hypovolemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypernatremia-in-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Enteral fluids including oral rehydration therapy are also typically hypotonic fluids.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1304699299\"><span class=\"h2\">Rate of correction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to determine the chronicity of hypernatremia when determining the rate of correction. As mentioned previously, in patients with chronic hypernatremia, cerebral adaption to hypernatremia takes place over the first few days with restoration of brain volume. In these patients, there is a risk of cerebral edema with rapid provision of free water. Even in cases where hypernatremia is known to have occurred acutely, similar rates of correction are generally used out of caution, especially with more pronounced aberrations in plasma sodium.</p><p>For children with chronic hypernatremia (plasma sodium &ge;150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> for greater than 24 hours) or those with acute severe hypernatremia (plasma sodium &gt;160 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L),</span> we and other experts recommend that a rate of correction does <strong>not</strong> exceed a fall of sodium greater than 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> per hour (ie, 10 to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> per day). The following studies provide support for this recommendation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective case control study of 97 children with hypernatremia and dehydration with a mean baseline serum sodium of 165 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> patients who developed cerebral edema had a significantly faster rate of correction compared with those without complications following correction of hypernatremia (1.0 versus 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> per hour) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypernatremia-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar findings were noted in another report in which the rate of reduction in serum sodium was 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> per hour in the nine infants who developed seizures compared with 0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> per hour or less in 31 infants who did not develop seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypernatremia-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1304699306\"><span class=\"h2\">Ongoing losses and maintenance needs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The above calculations correct free water losses that have occurred up to the time of presentation. Children have ongoing normal maintenance needs and may also have excess free water losses not accounted for by calculations for maintenance fluids (eg, continuing diarrhea or persistent fever), and should receive replacement of these ongoing losses to prevent further electrolyte derangement. Since ongoing losses can fluctuate over time, it can be challenging to try to estimate them for inclusion in a fluid and electrolyte prescription that addresses current deficits as well. Accordingly, many clinicians will prescribe fluid orders to address current needs and desired rates of correction, and write separate orders to address ongoing losses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintenance-fluid-therapy-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintenance fluid therapy in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1304699313\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of specific etiologies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial evaluation and management of hypernatremia usually occur concurrently. As noted above, obtaining additional laboratory studies for evaluation should not delay initiation of fluid therapy for the critically ill child. Although most young children develop hypernatremia related to acute illness or inability to take in fluid, in cases where a chronic condition is identified, such as nephrogenic or central diabetes insipidus, therapy directed to the underlying condition (eg, administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">desmopressin</a>) should be initiated in addition to providing free water replacement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H733673820\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical example</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following case synthesizes the information presented above in an attempt to show how the principles are applied clinically. A 10 kg child (TBW 0.6 times body weight) is estimated to have a 10 percent hypovolemic loss (approximately 1 liter of fluid) and a <span class=\"nowrap\">serum/plasma</span> sodium concentration of 156 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. The following calculations can be made:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Total fluid deficit &ndash; 10 percent of 10 kg = 1000 mL</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Free water deficit &ndash; 6 L <span class=\"nowrap\">[(156/140</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> - 1] = 686 mL</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isotonic loss &ndash; Total fluid deficit - Water deficit = 314 mL</p><p/><p>During the emergent fluid phase, the patient received a 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> bolus of normal saline (200 mL), replacing all but 114 mL of the isotonic fluid loss. Subsequent therapy includes replacement of the free water deficit (686 mL) and remaining isotonic loss (114 mL), maintenance of usual daily sodium and fluid needs (1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day</span> of one-quarter isotonic saline in this case), and any excess ongoing loss of fluid and electrolyte. The water deficit should be replaced over at least 36 hours so that the sodium is lowered at a rate below 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> per hour. This is often accomplished by replacing two-thirds of the free water deficit over the first 24 hours and the remainder over the next 12 or more hours.</p><p>Over the first 24 hours, the fluid regimen, which does not include replacement of excess ongoing losses, would entail:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Free water deficit (two-thirds of total water deficit) = 460 mL</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remaining isotonic deficit = 114 mL of water and 17 mEq of sodium</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintenance needs = 1000 mL of water and 30 mEq of sodium</p><p/><p>In this case, administration of one-quarter isotonic saline at 65 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> would provide adequate replacement of maintenance needs and remaining isotonic deficit, and would provide free water at a rate lower than the maximum threshold rate of 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> per hour. Enteral fluids can also be used to replace free water deficits and provide maintenance needs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1304699363\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypernatremia is defined as a serum or plasma sodium greater than 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> and is an uncommon problem in children. Pediatric hypernatremia is most commonly seen in the newborn period due to inadequate intake in breastfeeding neonates. In older children, the most common cause of hypernatremia is excess water loss from gastroenteritis or systemic infection. (See <a href=\"#H536507079\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypernatremia is due to imbalance of the body's handling of water resulting in an excess of plasma tonicity to total body water. In children, hypernatremia is usually caused by loss of body fluids with a sodium plus potassium concentration that is less than serum or plasma sodium. These losses are from the gastrointestinal tract, urine, or skin. Less frequently, pediatric hypernatremia can be caused by excess salt intake, including iatrogenic administration and salt poisoning. (See <a href=\"#H536507266\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1304699208\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants and small children are more vulnerable to hypernatremia than older individuals because of greater insensible water losses and their inability to communicate their need for fluids and access fluids independently. (See <a href=\"#H536507544\" class=\"local\">'Infants and young children'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical findings are generally manifested by neurological symptoms in patients with acute hypernatremia as water moves out of brain cells leading to cerebral contraction. The presence and severity of symptoms correlate with the degree of plasma or serum sodium elevation and its rate of rise, and range from nonspecific findings (eg, irritability, restlessness, weakness, vomiting, muscular twitching, fever, and, in infants, high-pitched cry and tachypnea) to severe neurologic findings of altered mental status, lethargy, coma, seizures, intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage, and demyelination. Most patients with chronic hypernatremia (defined as hypernatremia that is present more than one day) are asymptomatic as cerebral adaption restores brain volume. (See <a href=\"#H536507069\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of hypernatremia is made by the detection of an elevated plasma or serum sodium level above 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>.

However, it should be delayed in the severely ill patient who requires fluid resuscitation. In most cases, the etiology of hypernatremia is evident from the history. When the underlying diagnosis remains uncertain, comparing the urine with plasma osmolality may be helpful in identifying children with urinary concentrating defects (ie, diabetes insipidus [DI]) from those with water losses from the skin or gastrointestinal tract. In addition, urinary sodium and fractional excretion of sodium may help differentiate between hypernatremia due to water loss and salt <span class=\"nowrap\">ingestion/poisoning</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F88818\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef88818 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F88819\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88819 \">table 1</a>).

Management of pediatric hypernatremia includes determining the volume status of the patient, the magnitude of the water deficit, and the safe rate of sodium correction; and identifying maintenance fluid needs, excess ongoing losses not included in maintenance fluid calculation, and the etiology of hypernatremia. In addition, readjustment of therapy is based on data from ongoing monitoring of the patient's fluid status based on frequent clinical examinations and follow-up laboratory evaluation, including subsequent assessment of sodium levels.
