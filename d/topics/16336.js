Although various histologic subtypes of vulvar cancer exist, the vast majority are squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).

The Bartholin complexes (vestibular glands and ducts) are also considered components of the vulva, and malignancies arising in these structures are grouped with vulvar cancers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-female-urogenital-anatomy#H574016\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical female urogenital anatomy&quot;, section on 'Vulva'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bartholin-gland-masses-diagnosis-and-management#H438946272\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bartholin gland masses: Diagnosis and management&quot;, section on 'Bartholin gland carcinoma'</a>.)</p><p>Functionally, the vulva directs urine flow, prevents foreign bodies from entering the urogenital tract, and is a sensory organ for sexual arousal. The blood supply to the vulva is predominantly from the internal pudendal artery with a smaller contribution from the external pudendal artery. The anterior aspect of the vulva is innervated by the ilioinguinal and genitofemoral nerve. The posterior aspect of the vulva is innervated by the perineal branch of the posterior cutaneous nerve of the thigh laterally and the pudendal nerve centrally. The majority of the vulva is drained by lymphatics that pass laterally to the superficial inguinal lymph nodes. The clitoris and anterior labia minora may also drain directly to the deep inguinal or external iliac lymph nodes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1036886268\"><span class=\"h1\">MODE OF SPREAD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vulvar carcinoma metastasizes by a variety of mechanisms. Understanding these potential pathways is important for the evaluation and treatment of these tumors. Modes of spread include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Direct extension to adjacent structures (eg, vagina, urethra, clitoris, anus).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymphatic spread to regional lymph nodes can occur early in the course of disease, even in patients with small lesions. Vulvar cancer most commonly spreads initially to the superficial inguinal nodes immediately lateral to the pubic tubercles, which is why these nodes are sampled as part of staging. Lesions that are on one side of the vulva generally spread only to the ipsilateral inguinofemoral nodes (also referred to as groin nodes).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In one report, approximately 10 percent of superficially invasive vulvar cancers (ie, lesions with &gt;1 but &lt;3 mm depth of stromal invasion) had lymph node metastases at diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-vulva-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Formal evaluation on the distribution of sentinel lymph nodes in patients with vulvar cancer shows that 100 percent of sentinel nodes lie over or medial to the femoral vessels. In one study that included over 59 women with a vulvar cancer &lt;4 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-vulva-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], the sentinel nodes were superficial in approximately 85 percent of cases, and in 15 percent, the sentinel nodes laid deep to the cribriform fascia. These observations have important implications for the extent of inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy as well as the selection of radiotherapeutic target volumes and techniques.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hematogenous dissemination, which typically occurs late in the course of the disease, is rare in patients without inguinofemoral lymph node involvement. In one series, patients with fewer than three positive lymph nodes at the time of initial diagnosis had a significantly lower risk of hematogenous spread as compared with those with three or more positive lymph nodes (4 versus 66 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-vulva-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PRETREATMENT EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before proceeding with staging and surgical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> adjuvant therapy for vulvar cancer, the patient should undergo evaluation for ability to tolerate treatment and for conditions associated with vulvar cancer.</p><p>Issues specific to the preoperative evaluation of women with vulvar cancer are discussed here. General principles of the preoperative evaluation of patients for gynecologic surgery are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-preoperative-evaluation-and-preparation-for-gynecologic-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of preoperative evaluation and preparation for gynecologic surgery&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4257212546\"><span class=\"h2\">Ability to tolerate treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient should be evaluated for the ability to tolerate surgery and adjuvant therapy. A complete history and physical examination and appropriate laboratory testing are performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-vulva-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-preoperative-evaluation-and-preparation-for-gynecologic-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of preoperative evaluation and preparation for gynecologic surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Vulvar cancer typically occurs in older women. Management of medically frail patients is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-vulva-medical-therapy-and-prognosis#H1759717316\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva: Medical therapy and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Patients who are medically frail'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H275553892\"><span class=\"h2\">Other HPV-associated diseases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common etiology of vulvar cancer is human papillomavirus infection (HPV). Thus, the pretreatment evaluation should include evaluation for other HPV-associated disease (eg, cervical or vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia) and, if present, whether it requires surgical management or surveillance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-cancer-epidemiology-diagnosis-histopathology-and-treatment-of-rare-histologies#H956750412\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vulvar cancer: Epidemiology, diagnosis, histopathology, and treatment of rare histologies&quot;, section on 'Risk factors and etiology'</a>.)</p><p>We perform vulvar colposcopy in all patients because squamous intraepithelial lesions are often multifocal. In addition, we perform cervical cytology and colposcopy of the cervix and vagina. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colposcopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Colposcopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">STAGING AND SURGICAL TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The staging system for vulvar cancer is a hybrid of a clinical and surgical staging approach. Surgical assessment and treatment techniques for both vulvar excision and lymphadenectomy have evolved to allow less extensive surgery, while providing effective diagnosis and treatment. An overview of staging and surgical treatment for vulvar cancer is shown in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F108363\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108363 \">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2788385027\"><span class=\"h2\">Staging system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In vulvar cancer staging, tumor size, depth of invasion, and local extension are determined mostly on physical examination and vulvar biopsy, and lymph nodes are evaluated by physical examination, imaging, and lymphadenectomy or sentinel lymph node biopsy. </p><p>The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system for vulvar cancer is a hybrid clinical and <span class=\"nowrap\">surgical/pathologic</span> system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110814\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110814 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-vulva-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Previous systems for vulvar cancer staging were clinical systems. Surgical staging systems were introduced in 1988 and 1991. The combined clinical and <span class=\"nowrap\">surgical/pathologic</span> system was first introduced in 2009 and the current version was published in 2017 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-vulva-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7</a>]. </p><p>The shift was made from solely clinical staging because clinical staging may miss up to 24 percent of microscopic nodal metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-vulva-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Thus, the combined system was implemented because lymph node metastases are the most important prognostic factor for vulvar cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-vulva-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/5,10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,10-12</a>]. </p><p>The current staging system for vulvar cancer was introduced in 2017, with the following changes from the prior version [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-vulva-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/5,7,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vulvar melanoma is staged according to the melanoma staging system.

If the inguinofemoral nodes are enlarged, a biopsy is performed to confirm nodal metastases. This may be performed as a fine needle aspiration in the office or at the time of surgery. The presence of clinically palpable inguinofemoral nodes is an important determinant of the approach to further lymph node evaluation and management. Palpable supraclavicular nodes should be evaluated with imaging, since this may be evidence of distant metastases. (See <a href=\"#H4861854\" class=\"local\">'Inguinofemoral lymph nodes'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>For patients with locally advanced primary lesions, an examination under anesthesia may be necessary to allow for a thorough evaluation to determine the extent of disease. Cystoscopy and proctoscopy may be performed at this time, if clinically indicated.</p><p>For patients whose initial treatment will not be surgery because of either frailty or the extent of the primary tumor, it is helpful to take photographs of the extent of visible disease and enter these into the medical record. This assists in treatment planning and modification of treatment.

A slightly larger retrospective study (n = 122) reported no differences in the disease-free survival rate at five years for those treated by radical excision or radical vulvectomy (98 versus 93 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-vulva-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>The depth of the dissection for radical local excision is the same as in modified radical or radical vulvectomy (from the skin to the urogenital diaphragm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-vulva-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p>A tumor-free margin &ge;1 cm is required since a smaller margin is associated with an increased local recurrence risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-vulva-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/4,19,30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,19,30-33</a>].

For such patients, preoperative radiation or concomitant chemotherapy plus radiation therapy (RT) may be of benefit. (See <a href=\"#H4863986\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of positive or narrow margins'</a> below.)</p><p>In our practice, we use a technique for radical local excision that utilizes two or three separate incisions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F105337\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105337 \">figure 3</a>). The first incision is made to perform a radical local excision. This involves resection of the primary tumor with a width of 1 cm clinical margins laterally and, in terms of depth, a dissection down to the perineal membrane (also known as the deep fascia) of the urogenital diaphragm. The excision can be unilateral in most cases. Additional (and separate) incisions are for the inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy, which may be unilateral or bilateral depending on the primary vulvar tumor. This allows for an intervening skin bridge to remain intact, which helps to conserve vulvar anatomy and aid wound healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-vulva-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Of note, a cancer recurrence in the skin bridges can occur and is attributed to in-transit contamination of dermal lymphatics. This is uncommon and rarely seen unless there is extensive metastatic spread to regional lymph nodes or lesions &gt;4 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-vulva-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4863986\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment of positive or narrow margins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with tumor at or close to the surgical margins (&le;8 mm) identified at final pathologic analysis, we suggest re-excision when feasible to ensure complete resection.

Most vulvar cancers are squamous cell histology. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vulvar cancer is staged using a hybrid of clinical staging and the surgical staging system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging systems (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110814\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110814 \">table 1</a>). Tumor size and depth of invasion are determined mostly on physical examination and vulvar biopsy, and lymph nodes are evaluated by physical examination, imaging, and lymphadenectomy or sentinel lymph node biopsy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F108363\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108363 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Staging and surgical treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excision of the primary vulvar lesion is performed by radical local excision, if feasible. Large, central, or multicentric lesions may require modified radical vulvectomy. Resection of only involved tissue with an adequate margin conserves vulvar anatomy and aids wound healing. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Staging and surgical treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation or management of lymph nodes is determined primarily by whether there are clinically palpable inguinofemoral nodes on physical examination. (See <a href=\"#H4861854\" class=\"local\">'Inguinofemoral lymph nodes'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Women with stage IA disease require surgical resection of the primary lesion alone, with no lymphadenectomy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Women with no palpable inguinofemoral nodes undergo complete inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy. Selected patients with stage IB or II disease are candidates for sentinel node biopsy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Women with palpable inguinofemoral nodes do not undergo complete lymphadenectomy and are typically managed with a debulking procedure for the inguinofemoral nodes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with stage IB to II squamous cell vulvar cancer who are at low risk for lymph node metastases (lesions &lt;2 cm, lateral, no palpable nodes), we suggest a unilateral (ipsilateral) lymphadenectomy or sentinel node biopsy rather than bilateral lymphadenectomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). More data are needed regarding selection criteria for sentinel node biopsy in terms of the upper limit of tumor size and the risk of groin recurrence. Many institutions also offer sentinel node biopsy to patients with a tumor diameter up to &lt;4 cm. (See <a href=\"#H2347516327\" class=\"local\">'Unilateral versus bilateral'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy and radiation for vulvar cancer, both as adjuvant treatment as well as primary treatment for disease that cannot be surgically resected, are discussed separately.
