Compared with other types of uterine cancers, LMS is an aggressive tumor associated with a high risk of recurrence and death, regardless of stage at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-uterine-leiomyosarcoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Tumor grade and other histologic features can influence clinical behavior of the tumors and may be important determinants of treatment recommendations. Whenever possible, women with uterine sarcomas should be referred to specialty centers with expertise in their diagnosis and management. &#160;</p><p>This topic will cover the treatment approach to high-grade uterine LMS.

As an example, in one series of 106 women with uterine sarcoma, 65 percent of those with LMS were preoperatively diagnosed with a benign leiomyoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-uterine-leiomyosarcoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The sequence of events leading to the diagnosis may influence the treatment approach.</p><p>The diagnosis of LMS and differentiating benign leiomyomas from LMS are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differentiating uterine leiomyomas (fibroids) from uterine sarcomas&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-sarcoma-classification-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine sarcoma: Classification, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12821860\"><span class=\"h2\">Preoperative or intraoperative diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LMS is typically diagnosed postoperatively, but in rare cases it is diagnosed with endometrial sampling preoperatively or with frozen section intraoperatively. There is no single preoperative test that can reliably differentiate benign from malignant uterine disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas#H16656415\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differentiating uterine leiomyomas (fibroids) from uterine sarcomas&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic methods'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H107273603\"><span class=\"h3\">Disease confined to the uterus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with uterine LMS that is confined to the uterus at time of surgery, we proceed with a total hysterectomy. </p><p>Several case series support the role of primary surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-uterine-leiomyosarcoma/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. In the largest series involving 46 patients with LMS, complete cytoreduction was significantly associated with disease-free survival (p = 0.03) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-uterine-leiomyosarcoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>There is no reliable method to distinguish uterine sarcoma from benign leiomyomas preoperatively, as discussed in detail above. Among women planning surgery for one or more uterine masses that are presumed to be benign leiomyomas, the reported prevalence of uterine sarcoma ranges from 1 in 350 to 1 in 500. This should be taken into account when considering the approach to patients. Several retrospective studies show that women with LMS diagnosed following uterine morcellation have a high risk for sarcomatosis on re-exploration and have poorer survival outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-uterine-leiomyosarcoma/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. </p><p>In 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a safety alert recommending against the use of power morcellators in women with suspected or known uterine cancer, and recommending women be informed about the risk of unexpected cancer, which could be spread by power morcellation and worsen the patient&rsquo;s prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-uterine-leiomyosarcoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. On this basis, a reasonable approach is to avoid morcellation of the uterus in cases where there is clinical suspicion for uterine sarcoma. &#160;</p><p>Most experts also perform a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) at the time of total hysterectomy, particularly for menopausal or perimenopausal women. However, it is not clear if BSO influences survival in women with newly diagnosed LMS. (See <a href=\"#H107274058\" class=\"local\">'Premenopausal women'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H107273610\"><span class=\"h3\">Disease extending beyond the uterus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women with extrauterine disease, the role of surgery is controversial. Our approach depends on whether the patient is a surgical candidate and whether or not a complete resection of disease is feasible.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with disease confined to the pelvis, but with no invasion of the bladder or rectum (stage II) or the abdomen (stage III) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113544\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113544 \">table 1</a>), we perform a total hysterectomy with BSO and surgical cytoreduction of intraabdominal and retroperitoneal disease. Although the data are limited to small patient series, an optimal cytoreduction (to no gross residual disease) is associated with improved overall survival compared with women with residual disease at the end of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-uterine-leiomyosarcoma/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with disease not amenable to an optimal cytoreduction (including those with metastatic disease extending beyond the pelvis), there is no benefit to surgery. In at least one study, the presence of residual disease following surgery was associated with a poor prognosis compared with a complete cytoreduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-uterine-leiomyosarcoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In addition, surgery may delay the start of systemic treatment. Therefore, in the absence of high quality data showing a benefit to surgical cytoreduction, we initiate medical therapy rather than surgical cytoreduction. (See <a href=\"#H12822955\" class=\"local\">'Metastatic disease'</a> below.)<br/><br/>However, surgery may be reasonable in the following scenarios:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Total hysterectomy may serve as palliation for women experiencing significant pelvic symptoms (ie, pain or vaginal bleeding). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Total hysterectomy and resection of metastatic disease may be considered for selected patients with a relatively low disease burden beyond the peritoneal cavity (eg, isolated metastatic disease in the lung or liver). Complete resection in these patients may be possible with limited morbidity.

Instead, we perform a postoperative computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to help guide postoperative treatment. </p><p>For patients who underwent a hysterectomy (or myomectomy) alone and who are surgical candidates, however, a second surgical procedure is reasonable in the following situations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-uterine-leiomyosarcoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women who are premenopausal and do not desire ovarian preservation, we perform a BSO. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women who underwent a supracervical hysterectomy (or myomectomy), we suggest removal of the cervix or hysterectomy combined with a BSO.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women in whom the tumor was morcellated, we suggest surgical exploration and staging to ensure any residual peritoneal disease is resected. The value of reexploration after morcellation and the rapidity of spread was evaluated in a study in patients with no evidence of extrauterine disease at time of surgery who underwent morcellation and were subsequently diagnosed with uterine leiomyosarcoma. Re-exploration was performed immediately (within 50 days), and three of eight of these patients were upstaged to stage III or IV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-uterine-leiomyosarcoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H107274757\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR LYMPHADENECTOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We perform a pelvic lymphadenectomy for women if the pelvic nodes are palpably enlarged intraoperatively or there is evidence of extrauterine disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-uterine-leiomyosarcoma/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Women with LMS confined to the uterus have a low incidence of lymph node involvement. This was illustrated in a Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) study of 59 women with clinical stage I or II LMS (all of whom underwent surgical staging) in which the incidence of lymph node metastases was less than 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-uterine-leiomyosarcoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In another series of 37 patients with LMS who underwent nodal sampling, only three patients had positive nodes, and in all cases, they were clinically suspicious at surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-uterine-leiomyosarcoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H522011517\"><span class=\"h1\">ROLE OF IMAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Up to 33 percent of patients with newly diagnosed uterine LMS present with distant metastatic disease (stage IVB), most commonly involving the liver, lung, or upper abdomen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-uterine-leiomyosarcoma/abstract/2,6,11,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,11,14,15</a>]. Therefore, all patients should undergo imaging to rule out metastatic disease following pathologic confirmation of the diagnosis. </p><p>There are no data on the ideal imaging evaluation for women with LMS. Chest x-ray, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET scans) are all used to evaluate for metastatic disease for soft tissue sarcomas. We perform a CT perioperatively in all women diagnosed with LMS. There are no data on the utility of PET in perioperative staging of LMS, and the data on PET for the detection of recurrence are limited to retrospective case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-uterine-leiomyosarcoma/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. There is no evidence that it provides more useful information than either CT or MRI. Further discussion on the imaging evaluation of sarcomas is covered separately.

The difference is in the definitions for stage I; for LMS stage I substages are defined by tumor diameter (IA: &le;5 cm; IB: &gt;5 cm). Endometrial carcinoma and carcinosarcoma use an entirely different staging system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113543\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113543 \">table 2</a>). The separate staging systems for uterine sarcomas were introduced in 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-uterine-leiomyosarcoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>The FIGO staging system does not predict the prognosis for overall survival for patients with uterine LMS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-uterine-leiomyosarcoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. A nomogram that incorporates patient age, tumor size, grade, local extension, distant metastases, and mitotic rate as key variables may be prognostically more useful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-uterine-leiomyosarcoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Therefore, for women with surgical stage I or II LMS, we suggest observation as the standard management rather than adjuvant therapy. We encourage patients who desire more aggressive treatment to participate in a prospective randomized trial that is being conducted by the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) in collaboration with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and Cancer Research-UK, which compares the SARC005 regimen with observation in women who have undergone surgical resection of high-grade International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage I uterine LMS (GOG 277).</p><p>The data evaluating chemotherapy and radiation therapy (RT) for early-stage LMS are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28816387\"><span class=\"h3\">Chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Doxorubicin</a>, combination chemotherapy, and RT have been evaluated as adjuvant treatment for women with early-stage disease.

Given the poor prognosis for patients with uterine LMS regardless of stage, non-surgical treatment is palliative, not curative. Therefore, careful consideration of the benefits (eg, control of pain or bleeding) must be weighed against the toxicities of medical treatment.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LMS is surgically staged according to the 2017 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics <span class=\"nowrap\">(FIGO)/Tumor,</span> Node, Metastasis (TNM) classification system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113544\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113544 \">table 1</a>). This is the same staging system that is used for endometrial stromal sarcoma, but differs somewhat from the staging system for uterine adenosarcoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113544\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113544 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H213141155\" class=\"local\">'Staging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women in whom the diagnosis of LMS is made preoperatively (see <a href=\"#H12821860\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative or intraoperative diagnosis'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We recommend a total hysterectomy for women with disease confined to the uterus rather than non-operative therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). We suggest a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) also be performed at the time of surgery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H107273603\" class=\"local\">'Disease confined to the uterus'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women with disease that has spread beyond the uterus but is confined to the peritoneal cavity, we suggest surgical cytoreduction (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with metastatic disease that cannot be surgically resected or has spread beyond the peritoneal cavity, we suggest the administration of chemotherapy rather than radiation therapy (RT) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H107273610\" class=\"local\">'Disease extending beyond the uterus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We limit pelvic lymphadenectomy to women with pelvic nodes that are palpably enlarged intraoperatively or those with extrauterine disease.

We recommend against pelvic RT in these patients (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Enrollment in clinical trials investigating the role of adjuvant therapy should be encouraged, such as the clinical trial comparing adjuvant chemotherapy with observation discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H677536887\" class=\"local\">'Early-stage disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with stage III or IV LMS, we suggest chemotherapy rather than observation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H28815942\" class=\"local\">'Advanced disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For all women with newly diagnosed LMS, surveillance examinations and imaging is recommended due to the high risk of relapse, regardless of stage. (See <a href=\"#H12824634\" class=\"local\">'Post-treatment surveillance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with localized recurrence or limited metastatic disease that is amenable to complete resection, we suggest surgical resection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>) or consideration of local ablation techniques. (See <a href=\"#H12822947\" class=\"local\">'Local recurrence or oligometastatic disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with metastatic, unresectable disease, treatment is administered with palliative intent. Chemotherapy is a reasonable option for women with metastatic LMS who maintain a good performance status and in whom organ function permits the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy. For other patients, we suggest palliative care. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with metastatic disease who are chemotherapy naive, we suggest fixed dose-rate <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docetaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docetaxel</a> as first-line therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H107274208\" class=\"local\">'Preferred first-line therapy: Gemcitabine plus docetaxel'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women who progress after fixed-dose rate <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docetaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docetaxel</a>, a choice of chemotherapy is based on patient preference, organ function, and performance status. For women with hormone receptor-positive leiomyosarcoma, in whom the disease burden is low and the pace of disease is indolent, hormone-blockade therapy may be an alternative treatment option.
