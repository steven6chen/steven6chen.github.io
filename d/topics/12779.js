According to human and animal studies, high concentrations of inspired oxygen can cause a spectrum of lung injury, ranging from mild tracheobronchitis to diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-toxicity/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>]. The latter is histologically indistinguishable from that observed in the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The mechanisms and clinical consequences of oxygen toxicity are reviewed here. Specific issues related to the administration of oxygen are discussed separately.

Adverse events may result from increased oxygen tension in the alveoli, blood, or at the cellular level. Hyperoxia appears to produce cellular injury through increased production of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs), such as the superoxide anion, the hydroxyl radical, and hydrogen peroxide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-toxicity/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. When the production of these (ROIs) increases <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the cell's antioxidant defenses are depleted, they can react with and impair the function of essential intracellular macromolecules, resulting in cell death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-toxicity/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Oxygen free radicals may also promote a deleterious inflammatory response, leading to secondary tissue damage <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-toxicity/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Much of the evidence supporting direct cellular injury due to ROIs comes from studies in transgenic mice with altered superoxide dismutase activity. Mice with augmented antioxidant mechanisms are relatively tolerant to hyperoxia, while manganese superoxide dismutase knockout mice die shortly after birth with extensive mitochondrial injury within degenerating neurons and cardiac myocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-toxicity/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].

Hyperoxia may also increase susceptibility to mucous plugging, atelectasis, and secondary infection by impairing both mucociliary clearance and the bactericidal capacity of immune cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-toxicity/abstract/19-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL CONSEQUENCES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High fractions of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) have been associated with several effects on lung <span class=\"nowrap\">tissue/gas</span> exchange including diminished lung volumes and hypoxemia due to absorptive atelectasis, <span class=\"nowrap\">accentuation/production</span> of hypercapnia, and damage to airways and pulmonary parenchyma. The term &quot;oxygen toxicity&quot; is usually reserved for the last of these consequences, ie, tracheobronchial and alveolar damage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Absorptive atelectasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High FiO<sub>2 </sub>results in washout of alveolar nitrogen (nitrogen is replaced by oxygen, which is largely absorbed into the blood, resulting in a small alveolus prone to collapse), which can result in alveolar closure, ie, atelectasis. Absorptive atelectasis is theoretically more likely in the following circumstances:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A low regional ventilation-perfusion ratio (where oxygen diffuses from alveoli to capillaries faster than it is replenished by inhaled oxygen), decreasing alveolar volume, may result in complete alveolar closure. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Qualitative or quantitative surfactant abnormalities that promote alveolar collapse and further reduce the ventilation-perfusion ratio</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A high rate of oxygen uptake, due to an increase in metabolic demand</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An impaired pattern of respiration that fails to correct atelectasis (eg, ventilation at low tidal volumes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> without intermittent sighs or &quot;adequate&quot; PEEP when using mechanical ventilation)</p><p/><p>Shunting resulting from absorptive atelectasis is minor in younger patients, but can rise to as high as 11 percent in older, otherwise healthy volunteers breathing 100 percent oxygen for 30 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-toxicity/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Once established, absorptive atelectasis is not directly reversed by a reduction of FiO<sub>2</sub>, emphasizing the desirability of rapid titration of FiO<sub>2</sub> to the lowest fraction necessary to maintain an arterial oxygen saturation (SaO<sub>2</sub>) &gt;90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-toxicity/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Decrements in vital capacity of up to 20 percent have been noted after hyperoxic exposure in a number of experiments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-toxicity/abstract/2,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,19</a>]. This is presumably due to a combination of absorptive atelectasis compounded by shallow breaths related to pain due to secondary pleural irritation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Accentuation of hypercapnia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperoxic hypercarbia describes the phenomenon of increased partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) associated with increases in FiO<sub>2</sub> predominantly described in individuals with chronic compensated respiratory acidosis; these patients have limited ability to increase alveolar ventilation to compensate for rising PaCO<sub>2</sub> and falling pH. In general, increased hypercapnia does not lead to CO<sub>2</sub> narcosis and respiratory failure as the relative rise in PaCO<sub>2</sub> is small and these patients are acclimated to their higher baseline level of PaCO<sub>2</sub>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-evaluation-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-the-adult-patient-with-acute-hypercapnic-respiratory-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of the adult patient with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Several mechanisms act in concert to produce hyperoxic hypercapnia, including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-toxicity/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Haldane effect. This describes the rightward displacement of the CO<sub>2</sub>-hemoglobin dissociation curve in the presence of increased oxygen tension; the increased oxyhemoglobin results in dissociation of CO<sub>2</sub> from hemoglobin, increasing blood CO<sub>2</sub> levels. Since oxyhemoglobin binds CO<sub>2</sub> less avidly than deoxyhemoglobin, a patient with significant hypoxemia given supplemental oxygen may experience a rise in PaCO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increase in dead space (ie, &quot;wasted&quot;) ventilation. This probably reflects worsening ventilation-perfusion matching and redistribution of blood flow from well-ventilated to poorly ventilated alveoli due to a reversal of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction as alveolar PO<sub>2</sub> rises with the supplemental oxygen; the lung unit remains poorly ventilated since supplemental oxygen does not change the condition that produced the low ventilation. Carbon dioxide-induced bronchodilation may also be important in mediating the increase in dead space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-toxicity/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A modest decrease in minute ventilation, which also reduces alveolar ventilation, due to decreased stimuli from peripheral chemoreceptors to the central respiratory center. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of ventilation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The anxiolytic and anti-dyspneic effects of supplemental oxygen can promote sleep, particularly in patients who arrive in the emergency department sleep-deprived. The onset of sleep is associated with loss of the drive to breathe associated with the reticular activating system. When the awake and behavioral influences on breathing present during wakefulness are absent, respiration is sustained solely by metabolic control mechanisms. This can result in progressive hypercarbia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-toxicity/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypoventilation decreases inspiratory flow demand, which reduces the amount of room air entrained around a face mask or nasal cannula. This may increase the FiO<sub>2</sub> delivered to the patient, even if the flow rate from the oxygen source is unchanged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-toxicity/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The net effect is augmentation of the above mechanisms which worsen hypercapnia. The effect on ventilatory drive, increasing FiO<sub>2</sub>, sets up a dangerous vicious cycle, leading to progressive hypercapnia. If not aware of the pathophysiology, increasing FiO<sub>2 </sub>in hypoxemic patients with reduced drive may result in hypercapnic respiratory failure. As an example, in the postoperative patient, when oxygen saturation falls due to hypoventilation, increasing the FiO<sub>2</sub> further can lead to a vicious spiral of worsening hypoventilation, hypercapnia, and hypoxemia which is then treated with additional increases in supplemental oxygen, finally culminating in overt hypercapnic hypoxemic respiratory failure. Mechanisms and management of hypercapnia are discussed separately.

Erythema and edema of large airways can be observed bronchoscopically in most patients treated with a FiO<sub>2</sub> of 0.9 for six hours and are thought to reflect hyperoxic bronchitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-toxicity/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In addition, the concentration of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) in exhaled gas increases after only one hour of breathing 28 percent oxygen, regardless of the presence of underlying lung disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-toxicity/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a disease seen in neonates following recovery from neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, has been attributed to the effects of mechanical ventilation and oxygen toxicity in the immature lung. BPD is characterized by epithelial hyperplasia and squamous metaplasia in the large airways, thickened alveolar walls, and peribronchial and interstitial fibrosis. Infants with BPD generally suffer respiratory distress and require supplemental oxygen for up to six months. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and clinical features of bronchopulmonary dysplasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Parenchymal injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Progressive worsening of airspace disease can be observed in mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Possible mechanisms include progression of the underlying pulmonary process, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia, ventilator-induced lung injury secondary to mechanical forces, or diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) from oxygen toxicity. Determining the magnitude of parenchymal injury due solely to oxygen therapy in humans is problematic because confounders are always present. Much of the limited human data on hyperoxic pulmonary injury are derived from healthy volunteers exposed to high FiO<sub>2</sub>; clinical relevance is debatable.</p><p>Several studies involving patients in critical care units have attempted to assess the clinical significance of pulmonary oxygen toxicity but have yielded conflicting results:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One prospective study randomized 40 patients undergoing cardiac surgery to postoperative treatment with either 100 percent oxygen delivered via an endotracheal tube for a mean of 24 hours, or to the minimum FiO<sub>2</sub> required to maintain an arterial oxygen tension of 80 to 120 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-toxicity/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Despite the differences in FiO<sub>2</sub> exposure, there was no difference in right-to-left shunt fraction, effective compliance, or dead space to tidal volume ratio between the two groups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second report randomized 10 patients with irreversible brain damage to either 21 or 100 percent oxygen for a mean of 52 hours and in the hyperoxic group, noted increased right-to-left shunt fraction, and increased dead space to tidal volume ratio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-toxicity/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, postmortem examination of the lungs revealed no major histopathologic differences (including no hyaline membranes characteristic of early DAD) among the two treatment groups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The physiologic deterioration in the hyperoxic patients in the second study may have reflected progressive absorptive atelectasis, which was less prominent in the first series where patients were exposed to hyperoxia for shorter periods, and had spontaneous respiratory efforts. Alternatively, physiologic changes associated with brain injury or cardiac surgery may explain the apparent differences in behavior of these two populations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurogenic-pulmonary-edema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurogenic pulmonary edema&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective study of 16 previously healthy, nonsmoking survivors of ARDS found that treatment with an FiO<sub>2</sub> &gt;0.6 for more than 24 hours was both a sensitive and specific predictor of a reduced diffusing capacity (DLCO) at one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-toxicity/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Although there were potential biases in this study based on severity of illness (patients with more biologically severe ARDS presumably received higher concentrations of oxygen), the duration of FiO<sub>2</sub> &gt;0.6 was the only variable which predicted the degree of diffusing abnormality.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Potentiation by bleomycin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a> appear to be more susceptible to DAD following oxygen exposure, based upon in vitro data and uncontrolled clinical experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-toxicity/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The typical presentation of combined <span class=\"nowrap\">bleomycin/oxygen</span> toxicity involves a patient with testicular cancer or Hodgkin lymphoma who, after receiving bleomycin, requires high FiO<sub>2</sub> at any later time point, eg, due to aspiration, pneumonia, or general anesthesia. Following oxygen administration, the patient develops acute, subacute, or chronic worsening of bilateral alveolar infiltrates with increasing dyspnea, nonproductive cough, and decreasing lung compliance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-induced-lung-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bleomycin-induced lung injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of this syndrome is established by the exclusion of other processes such as heart failure, worsening pneumonia, ongoing aspiration, or alveolar hemorrhage. Lung injury associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> or external beam radiation may involve oxygen radicals in its pathogenesis, and also may predispose individuals to hyperoxic complications.

Central nervous system symptoms, including generalized tonic-clonic seizures, have been reported secondary to hyperoxia but are unusual in the absence of hyperbaric therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retinopathy-of-prematurity-pathogenesis-epidemiology-classification-and-screening\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retinopathy of prematurity: Pathogenesis, epidemiology, classification, and screening&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hyperoxia may also alter cardiovascular function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-toxicity/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. Increased oxygen tension can lead to local coronary vasoconstriction, and microscopic foci of myocardial necrosis have been observed in animal models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-toxicity/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Reductions in stroke volume and cardiac output, relative bradycardia, and an increase in systemic vascular resistance may ensue, but the clinical relevance of hyperoxia-related hemodynamic effects remains unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-toxicity/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no single threshold of fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) defining a safe upper limit for prevention of oxygen toxicity, although clinical experience suggests that in the absence of sensitizing agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a>, FiO<sub>2</sub> &lt;0.6 is not likely to induce oxygen toxicity. The relative importance of the duration and magnitude of hyperoxic exposure also has not been clearly defined, although it is likely that the area under the FiO<sub>2</sub> versus time curve is the best predictive variable. Factors that are difficult to quantify, such as the adequacy of a given patient's antioxidant defenses, probably also play a role in determining individual susceptibility.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Reduction of FiO2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reducing the FiO<sub>2</sub> to the lowest tolerable limit is a good principle for all patients, in particular those likely to be at risk of hyperoxia-induced lung injury because of a prolonged duration of oxygen therapy or prior therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a>. In practical terms, oxygen should be administered to achieve an arterial oxygen tension (PaO<sub>2</sub>) of 60 to 65 mmHg (arterial oxygen saturation [SaO<sub>2</sub>] approximately 90 percent).</p><p>A number of therapeutic strategies can be employed in patients with ARDS to minimize the need for a high FiO<sub>2</sub> and thereby reduce the risk of oxygen toxicity.

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical consequences'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oxygen toxicity is mediated by reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs), which can promote inflammation and induce cell death. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Cellular injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no well-defined threshold fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) or duration of supplemental oxygen therapy below which oxygen toxicity cannot occur. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with any previous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a> exposure who are hypoxemic should receive the lowest possible FiO<sub>2</sub> compatible with tissue oxygenation goals (ie, avoidance of tissue hypoxia). The potential for oxygen toxicity must be communicated to the anesthesiologist if a patient with bleomycin exposure needs a surgical or endoscopic procedure. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Reduction of FiO2'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The FiO<sub>2</sub> should be titrated to the lowest concentration required to meet oxygenation goals. In our practice, we typically aim for an arterial oxygen tension (PaO<sub>2</sub>) between 60 and 70 mmHg and oxygen saturation between 90 and 93 percent; further increases in PaO<sub>2</sub> add relatively little to the oxygen content of the blood. But, clinical judgment should be used in selecting a target oxygen saturation for an individual patient (eg, patients with coronary artery disease or pulmonary hypertension may tolerate hypoxemia poorly). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Reduction of FiO2'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional strategies to maximize oxygenation and reduce FiO<sub>2</sub> (eg, diuresis, bronchopulmonary hygiene, prone positioning, inhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitric-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitric oxide</a>, recruitment maneuvers <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> optimal positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP]) should be considered when FiO<sub>2</sub> exceeds 60 percent for more than six hours. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Reduction of FiO2'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of antioxidants to prevent oxygen toxicity remains experimental. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Augmentation of antioxidants'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3400079135\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge David R Schwartz, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Gilbert DL.
