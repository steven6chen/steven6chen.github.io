Vertebral compression fractures are the most common type of osteoporotic fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-thoracolumbar-vertebral-compression-fractures-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. They often occur at the midthoracic (T7-T8) spine and the thoracolumbar junction (T12-L1). Fractures may result in significant back pain, limited physical functioning and activities of daily living, and can lead to loss of independence, depression, and chronic pain. Osteoporotic fracture is an important risk factor for subsequent fracture.</p><p>This topic will review the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of acute osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. The diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-osteoporosis-in-men\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of osteoporosis in men&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-osteoporosis-in-men\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of osteoporosis in men&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms and signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Osteoporotic vertebral compression that occurs slowly over time is often asymptomatic. Old or healed fractures may be an incidental finding on radiographs of the chest or abdomen. In other patients, the presence of vertebral fractures may become apparent because of height loss or kyphosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-thoracolumbar-vertebral-compression-fractures-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In contrast, acute episodes of significant vertebral body compression are associated with pain. The pain may be tolerable and resolve without medical intervention (but the patient can often recall the episode of pain when a fracture is incidentally found on other imaging) or the pain may be incapacitating, requiring hospital admission and parenteral opioids. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Height loss'</a> below and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Kyphosis'</a> below.)</p><p>In patients who have acute symptomatic vertebral body fracture, there is often no history of preceding trauma. The typical patient presents with acute back pain after sudden bending, coughing, or lifting. Occasionally, minor trauma, such as going over speed bumps, may precipitate a fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-thoracolumbar-vertebral-compression-fractures-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The pain is usually well localized to the midline spine but often refers in a unilateral or bilateral pattern into the flank, anterior abdomen, or the posterior superior iliac spine. By contrast, radiation of pain into the legs, as may be seen with a herniated disc, is rare with compression fractures but may herald spinal cord or nerve root compression from retropulsed bone fragments.</p><p>The pain from a vertebral compression fracture is variable in quality and may be sharp or dull. Sitting, spine extension, Valsalva maneuver, and movement often aggravate the pain and may be accompanied by muscle spasms. Sleep may be disturbed by pain. On physical examination, the patient may experience pain upon palpation and percussion of the corresponding spinous process and paravertebral structures.</p><p>Acute episodes of pain following a vertebral body fracture usually resolve after four to six weeks, but pain may persist for longer periods (many months), indicating an unhealed or slowly healing fracture. Severe back pain that presents after a normal period of healing may indicate additional fractures or another diagnosis.</p><p>Functional impairment from vertebral fracture is often comparable with that related to hip fracture, including difficulty bending, lifting, reaching, walking down stairs, or cooking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-thoracolumbar-vertebral-compression-fractures-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Approximately 75 percent of patients who present with a symptomatic vertebral fracture complain of chronic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-thoracolumbar-vertebral-compression-fractures-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Height loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Height loss from osteoporosis is typically asymptomatic and gradual. In addition to osteoporotic compression fractures, height loss can be caused by disc desiccation and resultant disc space narrowing or scoliosis. In one study, historical height loss of &gt;6 cm had a specificity and sensitivity of 94 and 30 percent, respectively, for detection of vertebral fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-thoracolumbar-vertebral-compression-fractures-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Kyphosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Kyphosis (&quot;dowager hump&quot;) may be an indicator of multiple vertebral compression fractures, especially wedge fractures, although kyphosis may occur independently of vertebral abnormalities. Each complete compression fracture causes approximately 1 cm or more loss in height; loss of more than 4 cm in height is associated with 15 degrees of kyphosis. Practically, however, there are no simple clinical measures of kyphosis, and measures of height may be inconsistent due to variabilities in measurement technique and posture. Some potentially useful clinical measurements include the distance from the occiput to the wall (normally 0 cm) and the size of the gap between the costal margin and the iliac crest (normally three fingerbreadths) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F93171\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef93171 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-thoracolumbar-vertebral-compression-fractures-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Measuring kyphosis is discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hyperkyphosis in older persons&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with kyphosis may complain of a protuberant abdomen, that their clothes do not fit, or that they no longer have a waist. They may also complain of early satiety. These symptoms reflect the compression of the abdominal contents as a result of kyphosis.</p><p>Patients with severe thoracic kyphosis often complain of mechanical neck pain or headache since they must forcefully extend their necks in order to look forward. They often have cervical facet disease and degenerative disc disease due to the hyperextension of the cervical spine in order to remain upright. Restrictive pulmonary disease may become apparent with severe kyphosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-thoracolumbar-vertebral-compression-fractures-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>A costo-iliac impingement syndrome can develop in patients with kyphosis following multiple vertebral fractures, wherein the most inferior rib impinges against the iliac crest due to a reduction in the normal distance between the bottom of the rib cage and the top of the iliac crests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-thoracolumbar-vertebral-compression-fractures-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. This causes pain in the region of the 12th thoracic vertebra that radiates to the posterior trunk. Patients may also complain of hip pain and, when pressed for details, can pinpoint the sensation to the superior iliac crest.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of subsequent fracture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A history of an osteoporotic fracture is a risk factor for subsequent fractures. Approximately 19 percent of patients who have a vertebral compression fracture will have another fracture in the next year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-thoracolumbar-vertebral-compression-fractures-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In one analysis of the literature, women with preexisting vertebral fractures had approximately four times greater risk of subsequent vertebral fractures than women without prior fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-thoracolumbar-vertebral-compression-fractures-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The presence of vertebral fractures also predicts future nonvertebral fractures, particularly hip fracture, and this risk increases with the number and severity of prior fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-thoracolumbar-vertebral-compression-fractures-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteoporotic fracture risk assessment&quot;, section on 'Personal history of fracture as an adult'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a suspected acute vertebral body compression fracture should be evaluated with plain radiographs of the thoracolumbar spine to confirm the diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3317740101\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Osteoporosis may lead to several types of vertebral abnormalities, including wedge fractures, biconcave or &quot;codfish&quot; deformities, and compression fractures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F74656\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74656 \">figure 2</a>). Radiographic characteristics of compression fractures include anterior wedging of one or more vertebrae with vertebral collapse, vertebral endplate irregularity, and general demineralization (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F60593\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60593 \">image 1</a>). Posterior wedging is uncommon and may indicate an underlying destructive lesion. The severity of vertebral fractures may be radiographically staged as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-thoracolumbar-vertebral-compression-fractures-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 1: 20 to 25 percent height deformity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 2: 25 to 40 percent height deformity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 3: &gt;40 percent height deformity</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Compression fracture may be the first symptom of osteoporosis.

The vertebral abnormalities of Scheuermann disease include endplate irregularities and wedging of the vertebral body without low bone density. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=back-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-causes#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Back pain in children and adolescents: Causes&quot;, section on 'Scheuermann (juvenile) kyphosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hyperkyphosis in older persons&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neurologic exam</strong> &ndash; The patient should be assessed for neurologic findings (dermatomal sensory deficits, focal weakness, upper motor neuron signs like clonus). Neurologic abnormalities may indicate retropulsed bone fragments in the spinal canal or foraminae that may demand surgical intervention.

A CT scan is helpful in determining potential instability of a wedge fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-thoracolumbar-vertebral-compression-fractures-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. MRI or bone scans are useful for assessing the acuity of the fracture when such information is important (eg, determining whether a fracture is a source of recent onset back pain), and additionally may provide information on whether there is an underlying malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-thoracolumbar-vertebral-compression-fractures-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) bone density study, performed on a nonurgent basis, is preferred for quantitative assessment of bone density and assessment of future fracture risk.</p><p/><p>After a diagnosis of osteoporosis has been made, a consultation with a clinician who has expertise in the management of osteoporosis is often helpful for providing osteoporosis treatment recommendations. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Treatment for osteoporosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1565673\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach outlined below is based upon clinical experience and limited evidence from observational studies and randomized trials.</p><p>The initial management of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures should include pain control and activity modification. Oral analgesics are first-line therapy for the relief of acute pain. Options include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a>, mild opioids combined with acetaminophen, or mixed mechanism drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tramadol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tramadol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tapentadol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tapentadol</a>), centrally acting analgesics whose mode of action is based both on mu opioid receptor binding and monoamine (serotonin and norepinephrine) reuptake blockade. Choice of initial agent depends upon the severity of the pain (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Oral analgesics'</a> below). For patients incapacitated by pain due to vertebral compression fractures, hospitalization and parenteral analgesia may be necessary.</p><p>The indications for and timing of vertebral augmentation procedures are controversial. Most patients with vertebral compression fractures can be treated successfully with conservative management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-thoracolumbar-vertebral-compression-fractures-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, vertebral augmentation may be beneficial in select patient groups (eg, incapacitating pain and in those who are not improving with conservative medical management). (See <a href=\"#H1565702\" class=\"local\">'Severe pain'</a> below and <a href=\"#H17476627\" class=\"local\">'Candidates for vertebral augmentation'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients should resume physical activity as quickly as possible. Complete bedrest is not recommended, as inactivity may result in further bone loss and deconditioning. Physical therapy is recommended for gait and core strengthening when the patient can tolerate this level of activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-thoracolumbar-vertebral-compression-fractures-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Patient education is important. The patient should be informed that fractures may take up to three months to heal and that pain should diminish gradually with a commensurate improvement in activity tolerance. Lying supine with the hips and legs flexed (the <span class=\"nowrap\">90/90</span> rest position) may be helpful in reducing pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F69048\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69048 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>Long-term management should include medications to improve low bone density. For example, medications such as bisphosphonates, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raloxifene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">raloxifene</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=teriparatide-recombinant-human-parathyroid-hormone-1-34-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">teriparatide</a> (parathyroid hormone 1-34 [PTH(1-34)]), may lead to increased bone mass and a reduction in the rate of new fractures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-osteoporosis-in-men\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of osteoporosis in men&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If present, underlying diseases (eg, osteomalacia, hyperparathyroidism, granulomatous diseases, hematologic diseases, infections, metastatic cancer) require further management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1565696\"><span class=\"h3\">Mild-to-moderate pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with mild-to-moderate pain can be treated with oral analgesics. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acetaminophen</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> may be sufficient for initial management.

(See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Oral analgesics'</a> below and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Calcitonin'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1565702\"><span class=\"h3\">Severe pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with severe pain from an acute (0 to 4 weeks) vertebral body fracture typically require opioids at the outset. If the pain is incapacitating, hospital admission and parenteral analgesia for pain management may be necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-perioperative-pain#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute perioperative pain&quot;, section on 'Parenteral opioids'</a>.)</p><p>Parenteral opioids are converted to oral formulation during the inpatient stay (typically three to seven days), and the clinician assesses the clinical efficacy of this transition. Intolerable side effects of these medications, particularly constipation, sedation, and delirium, are seen early after administration. Older adult and deconditioned patients and those with multiple comorbidities are more susceptible to the cognitive side effects of parenteral opioids. The rate of opioid tapering should be assessed on a case-by-case basis, based on the patient's side effect profile, level of function, and subjective reports of persistent ongoing pain. For patients with incapacitating pain from acute and subacute vertebral compression fractures, who are unable to transition from parenteral to oral opioids within seven days of admission or have intolerable sedation, constipation, or delirium from this therapy, we prefer vertebral augmentation during the initial hospitalization to continued medical management. (See <a href=\"#H17476627\" class=\"local\">'Candidates for vertebral augmentation'</a> below.)</p><p>The majority of hospitalized patients with severe pain, however, are able to discontinue parenteral analgesia, report adequate pain control with oral analgesics (typically opioids), and are discharged from the hospital. Many will have slow improvement in pain, will be able to taper and discontinue opioids, and will begin physical therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1565708\"><span class=\"h3\">Persistent pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management options for patients with persistent pain (greater than six weeks of medical management) include continued medical management or vertebral augmentation. We suggest continued medical management for patients who have noticed some improvement in pain and who are able to tolerate, maintain, or taper opioids and begin a physical therapy program. For those who are not satisfied with the level of symptomatic relief (eg, even with higher doses of opioids), are unable to perform the activities of daily living, or are not tolerating opioids (constipation, confusion, urinary retention), we prefer vertebral augmentation to continued medical management. It is important to note that in some patients with persistent pain, the degree of vertebral compression may progress with time to such an extent that vertebral augmentation may be difficult to perform successfully. In such cases, continued medical management is the only option.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1565714\"><span class=\"h3\">Chronic pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with chronic pain (three to six months post fracture) require further evaluation to determine if the fracture remains metabolically active (as evidenced by the presence of bone marrow edema) or if additional fractures or other pain generators may have developed. We perform a physical examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the affected spine region. Tenderness to <span class=\"nowrap\">palpation/percussion</span> at the level of the fracture and MRI findings of bone marrow edema are consistent with a nonhealing or slowly healing fracture. It may be helpful to identify the painful spinal level using fluoroscopy. Inpatients with nonhealing or slowly healing fracture, treatment options include continued medical management or vertebral augmentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-thoracolumbar-vertebral-compression-fractures-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Patients should be informed that there are few data evaluating vertebral augmentation in patients with chronic fractures, and that pain may not improve after the procedure.

In the largest trial to date, 300 patients with one to three acute (mean six weeks old) vertebral fractures were randomly assigned to kyphoplasty versus nonsurgical care (not a sham procedure as in the above vertebroplasty trials) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-thoracolumbar-vertebral-compression-fractures-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. After one month, patients assigned to kyphoplasty had greater improvement in the short-form (SF)-36 physical component summary scale, a validated quality of life measurement. However, after 12 and 24 months, the difference in improvement between the two groups was no longer significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporotic-thoracolumbar-vertebral-compression-fractures-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>].

However, acute episodes of significant vertebral body compression, which may occur after sudden bending, coughing, lifting, or a fall are associated with pain. The pain is usually well localized to the midline spine but often refers in a unilateral or bilateral pattern into the flank, anterior abdomen, or the posterior superior iliac spine. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evaluation of an osteoporotic compression fracture includes assessment for neurologic findings, which may necessitate further imaging and consultation with a spine surgeon; laboratory evaluation to assess for malignancy (such as multiple myeloma) and secondary causes of osteoporosis may be indicated. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of an acute osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture includes pain control, activity modification, education, and treatment of the underlying osteoporosis. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral analgesics are first-line therapy for the relief of acute pain due to vertebral compression fractures. The choice of initial agent depends upon the severity of the pain. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acetaminophen</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> is often sufficient for initial management in patients with mild pain. Opioids <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitonin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitonin</a> are options for when the patient reports inadequate analgesia with initial medications or when pain is moderate to severe. Patients with severe pain from an acute (0 to 4 weeks) vertebral body fracture typically require opioids at the outset. When opioids are required to control pain from vertebral compression fractures, we typically initiate treatment with an opioid combined with low-dose acetaminophen. (See <a href=\"#H1565673\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Oral analgesics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with mild-to-moderate pain who do not have adequate pain relief with oral analgesics, we suggest adding nasal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitonin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitonin</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Calcitonin is typically given for a two- to four-week course or until the patient is able to get started on a more effective osteoporosis treatment regimen. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Calcitonin'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitonin-in-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-osteoporosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Calcitonin in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis&quot;, section on 'Bone pain'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest<strong> not</strong> using skeletal muscle relaxants for the acute management of pain in patients with osteoporotic compression fractures (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Muscle relaxants'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient selection is a critical factor for both the decision to perform vertebral augmentation and for the selection of the type of procedure. Vertebral augmentation is <strong>not</strong> indicated for patients with mild-to-moderate pain that is responding to medical management. For patients with incapacitating pain from acute and subacute vertebral compression fractures who are unable to taper parenteral or transition to oral opioids within seven days of admission or have intolerable sedation, constipation, or delirium from this therapy, we suggest vertebral augmentation rather than continued medical management (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This is typically performed during the initial hospitalization. Vertebral augmentation is also an option for those without improvement in pain despite timely (four to six weeks) conservative management with oral opioids and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitonin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitonin</a>, or for those who are intolerant of oral opioids. (See <a href=\"#H17476627\" class=\"local\">'Candidates for vertebral augmentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While kyphoplasty is performed more frequently than vertebroplasty, vertebroplasty may be the preferred procedure for a select subset of patients (eg, endplate fractures, wherein the entire vertebral body is not compressed). Vertebroplasty is also technically easier to perform, does not commit to a bipedicular approach, does not rely on the performance of a balloon system, and is less expensive. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Vertebral augmentation procedures (vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty)'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17476834\" class=\"local\">'Selection of procedure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a brace is used to relieve pain, it should be used in the acute and subacute phases of treatment for pain control but not longer, as atrophy of the core musculature may occur with prolonged use.
