It happens when the renal arteries, the blood vessels that carry blood to the kidneys, become narrow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F70583\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70583 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>High blood pressure puts you at risk for heart attack, stroke, and kidney disease. It does not usually cause symptoms. But it can be serious.</p><p>When your doctor or nurse tells you your blood pressure, he or she will say 2 numbers. For instance, your doctor or nurse might say that your blood pressure is &quot;140 over 90.&quot; The top number is the pressure inside your arteries when your heart is contracting. The bottom number is the pressure inside your arteries when your heart is relaxed.</p><p>This table shows how doctors and nurses define high and normal blood pressure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F59480\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59480 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Renovascular hypertension is sometimes called &quot;renal artery stenosis.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15868917\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. If you have renovascular hypertension, your doctor might be able to hear a &quot;whooshing&quot; sound when listening to your belly through a stethoscope.</p><p>The doctor can also order imaging tests that create pictures of the renal arteries. But these tests are only done if the doctor thinks a procedure to open up the arteries could be helpful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15868932\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse right away if you have high blood pressure and get any of the following symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A very bad headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe pain in your upper back</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weakness on one side of your body and not the other</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems speaking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea or vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vision changes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nosebleeds</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood in your urine</p><p/><p>These can be signs of a very serious type of high blood pressure that needs to be treated as soon as possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15868947\"><span class=\"h1\">How is renovascular hypertension treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments include medicines for high blood pressure, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ACE inhibitors and ARBs &ndash; ACE inhibitors and ARBs are often grouped together, because they work in similar ways. These medicines can help prevent kidney disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some examples of ACE inhibitors include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enalapril-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">enalapril</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=captopril-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">captopril</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lisinopril-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">lisinopril</a>.

For more detailed information about your medicines, ask your doctor or nurse for the patient hand-out from Lexicomp, available through UpToDate. It explains how to use each medicine, describes its possible side effects, and lists other medicines or foods that can affect how it works.</p><p>Your doctor might recommend a procedure called &quot;angioplasty&quot; to open up one (or possibly both) of your renal arteries. During an angioplasty, the doctor puts a thin tube into a blood vessel in the leg and advances the tube to the kidney. Then the doctor inflates a tiny balloon inside the clogged artery to reopen it. Often the doctor props open the artery using a tiny mesh tube called a stent. Doctors only recommend angioplasty in certain situations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15869028\"><span class=\"h1\">Can renovascular hypertension be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can reduce your chances of getting renovascular hypertension by keeping your blood vessels healthy.
