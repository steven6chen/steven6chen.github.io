The rectum and sigmoid colon are most often affected.</p><p>This topic will review the clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of radiation proctitis. The adverse effects of radiation therapy on the esophagus, stomach, small and large intestine, anus, and liver are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-gastrointestinal-toxicity-of-radiation-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of gastrointestinal toxicity of radiation therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-management-of-chronic-radiation-enteritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and management of chronic radiation enteritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation proctopathy is defined as epithelial damage to the rectum due to radiation that is associated with minimal or no inflammation. The term radiation proctitis is somewhat misleading, since it inaccurately implies a chronic inflammatory condition of the rectum. However, because radiation proctitis continues to be widely used, it will be used in this topic review.</p><p/><p>Based on the timing of symptoms in relation to radiation therapy, radiation proctitis can be divided into the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute radiation proctitis occurs during or within six weeks of radiation therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic radiation proctitis has a more delayed onset. The first symptoms often occur 9 to 14 months following radiation exposure but can occur any time post-irradiation up to 30 years after exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-radiation-proctitis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H524513992\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reliable estimates of the incidence of radiation proctitis are not available due to variability in the definition and reporting of radiation proctitis. However, the incidence of radiation proctitis in patients treated with brachytherapy alone is estimated to range from 8 to 13 percent and up to 21 percent when used in combination with other modalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-radiation-proctitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The reported incidence of chronic radiation proctitis ranges from 2 to 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-radiation-proctitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Risk factors for radiation proctitis include the dose of radiation, area of exposure, and method of delivery. Doses of radiation &lt;45 Gy are associated with few long-term radiation side effects. In contrast, doses between 45 and 70 Gy cause more complications, and doses above 70 Gy cause significant and longstanding injury to the surrounding area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-radiation-proctitis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>The method of radiation delivery is an important predictor of the risk of radiation proctitis. External beam radiation, typically administered by a linear accelerator, results in significantly greater exposure to surrounding organs as compared with brachytherapy, where radiation is administered via radioactive implants. Newer modalities of external beam radiation delivery, including three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy, and the use of heavy particles including protons and neutrons, may be associated with a reduced risk of radiation toxicity.

In addition, patients may have symptoms of obstructed defecation due to strictures with symptoms of constipation, rectal pain, urgency, and, rarely, fecal incontinence due to overflow.</p><p>Concomitant injury to the genitourinary tract or small bowel may lead to fistulas, small bowel obstruction, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, urethral stenosis, and cystitis.

Chronic radiation proctitis should be suspected in patients who develop these symptoms nine months or more after pelvic radiation exposure. Since the symptoms of radiation proctitis are not specific, establishing the diagnosis requires the exclusion of other causes of colitis by history, laboratory studies, and, if permissible, biopsies of the colon obtained on endoscopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H610740039\"><span class=\"h3\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A history of risk factors for other causes of colitis should be sought. This includes a history of recent travel to areas endemic for parasitic infections including amebiasis, recent antibiotic use that might predispose to an infection with <em>Clostridium difficile</em>, and a history of or risk factors for sexually transmitted diseases (eg, <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> and herpes simplex virus [HSV]) that are associated with proctitis. Atherosclerotic disease or prior ischemic episodes are suggestive of chronic colonic ischemia. A history of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) exposure should be sought, as these drugs (and others) may also be associated with colitis. In an immunocompromised patient, cytomegalovirus (CMV) can cause colitis.

Mucosal features consistent with radiation injury include pallor with friability, and telangiectasias, which can be multiple, large, and serpiginous. These changes tend to be continuous without skip lesions but can be varying in intensity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-radiation-proctitis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In patients with chronic radiation proctitis, the rectum appears pale and noncompliant with telangiectasias and may have strictures, ulcerations, fistulas, and areas of mucosal hemorrhage.</p><p>Histologic findings suggestive of radiation proctitis include eosinophilic infiltrates, epithelial atypia, fibrosis, and capillary telangiectasia. Although mucosal biopsies are not diagnostic, they can help to exclude other causes of proctitis such as infection or inflammatory bowel disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-radiation-proctitis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Although case reports suggested a possible benefit in patients with chronic radiation proctitis, there was no significant improvement in symptoms in a randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-radiation-proctitis/abstract/16,22,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,22,26</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Sucralfate enema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have suggested that topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sucralfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sucralfate</a> may improve symptoms of radiation proctitis or proctosigmoiditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-radiation-proctitis/abstract/15,27-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,27-32</a>]. The rationale for its use is based upon its favorable effects on epithelial microvascular injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-radiation-proctitis/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].</p><p>In a randomized trial, 37 patients with radiation-induced proctosigmoiditis were assigned to a four-week course of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a> (3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> enemas (20 mg twice daily) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sucralfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sucralfate</a> enemas (2 g twice daily) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-radiation-proctitis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Clinical improvement was noted in both groups at the end of the study. Although the endoscopic response was not different between groups, the clinical response for sucralfate enemas was better as compared with oral sulfasalazine and prednisolone enemas. Sucralfate enemas were also better tolerated. </p><p>Remission of bleeding may be sustained following discontinuation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sucralfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sucralfate</a>.

A variety of other endoscopic methods have also been used to treat radiation colitis. However, there is significant heterogeneity in the studies evaluating the efficacy of these endoscopic therapies, and few studies have directly compared them.</p><p>Due to the potential risk of rectourethral fistulas in the first six months to two years after radiation therapy, all endoscopic treatment should be coordinated with a urologic radiation oncologist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-radiation-proctitis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

The majority of patients had improvement in bleeding and anemia after a median of 2.9 sessions (range one to eight). All visible lesions were targeted at each session, and follow-up procedures were scheduled in four-week intervals to allow the tissue to heal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F64264\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64264 \">picture 1</a>). The mean hemoglobin rose by 1.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> and by 1.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> among individuals presenting with anemia.

In a pilot study, 7 out of 10 patients with radiation proctitis responded to cryoablation with a decrease in rectal telangiectasia density and improvement in radiation proctitis symptom severity.

They cause less tissue injury and permit tangential application of cautery, and the equipment needed is widely available and relatively inexpensive. However, it is unclear if they are more effective in treating chronic radiation proctitis as compared with other modalities. BiCap and heater probe were evaluated in a study involving 21 patients with chronic recurrent hematochezia and anemia due to radiation-induced injury who were followed for 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-radiation-proctitis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Patients were treated with either BiCap or heater probe therapy as needed. Severe bleeding diminished significantly after these treatments as compared with the previous 12 months of medical therapy (75 versus 33 percent and 67 versus 11 percent, respectively). The decreased rate of bleeding was accompanied by an improvement in the hematocrit in both groups. There were no major complications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Radiofrequency ablation</strong> &ndash; Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been used to treat radiation proctitis refractory to APC in case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-radiation-proctitis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. RFA has the advantage over other methods in that it covers a broader surface area and has a uniformly shallow depth of injury (&lt;1 mm), making it ideal for radiation proctitis. However, additional studies are needed to assess the long-term effects of RFA and its role in the treatment of radiation proctitis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Formalin</strong> &ndash; Formalin induces coagulative tissue necrosis on contact, providing the rationale for its use in patients with radiation proctitis who have significant bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-radiation-proctitis/abstract/49-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-58</a>]. Although the procedure has generally been well tolerated, and several studies have reported an improvement in symptoms, APC may be more effective in treating radiation proctitis as compared with formalin therapy, and there is currently insufficient evidence to support its use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-radiation-proctitis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In addition, serious complications, including the development of fistulas requiring colostomy and bowel necrosis requiring resection, have also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-radiation-proctitis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Direct contact of the formalin with the anoderm can be extremely irritating to the skin and should be avoided. Endoscopic flushing out of residual formalin with saline may be prudent after the formalin has had some dwell time (5 to 10 minutes) to reduce anal and skin irritation. This should occur just before the procedure is terminated. Several techniques have been used to administer formalin:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In one series that included 33 patients, 23 required one formalin application and 10 required a second application because of persistent bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-radiation-proctitis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Treatment was considered to be effective in 23 patients (70 percent); 13 had complete cessation of bleeding, while 10 had only minor bleeding. Six anal or rectal strictures developed after treatment, and fecal incontinence worsened in five patients and developed in an additional four patients. The authors concluded that formalin application was effective, but morbidity was not negligible. Many of the patients who developed complications had been treated for anal cancer (four of the six patients who developed a stricture and all five of the patients who developed worsening incontinence), possibly explaining the increased morbidity compared with other series.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a variation on the technique described above, in another retrospective study of 20 patients, 20 mL of a 5 percent formalin solution was instilled into the rectum during flexible sigmoidoscopy without sedation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-radiation-proctitis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. A single session was effective in controlling bleeding in 13 of 20 patients (65 percent), while four responded to a second treatment. Average follow-up was 23 months. There were no serious complications, but the sample size was small.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Another series included 100 patients who were treated by direct application of a 10 percent buffered formalin solution to the affected area using a 16-inch cotton tip applicator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-radiation-proctitis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Treatment was applied through a proctoscope in the office. Overall, 93 percent of patients had cessation of bleeding after an average of 3.5 applications at two- to four-week intervals. Three patients complained of anal pain and one of dizziness after the procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery should be reserved for patients who have intractable symptoms such as a stricture, pain, bleeding, perforation, or a fistula. Anastomotic breakdown of irradiated tissue is a potential complication of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-radiation-proctitis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Surgery may also be technically demanding due to adhesions and has been associated with a high risk of complications (15 to 80 percent) and mortality (3 to 9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-radiation-proctitis/abstract/3,61-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,61-63</a>]. In one study of 48 patients who had been referred for severe refractory radiotherapy complications that had failed initial treatment, surgery was generally required for patients with a fistula, and permanent diversion was more likely in patients with severe radiation enteritis and a distal colonic stricture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-radiation-proctitis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. In patients with severe and intractable bleeding, a diverting loop colostomy only rarely controls bleeding and, in such cases, proctectomy may be the only option. In this setting, construction of an ileocecal reservoir has been associated with a good functional outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-radiation-proctitis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H520853351\"><span class=\"h3\">Other therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several other therapies have been evaluated in patients with radiation proctitis.

HBO therapy has been associated with improved outcomes in patients with radiation proctitis in observational studies and in a randomized controlled trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-radiation-proctitis/abstract/66-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-70</a>]. However, these studies have methodological limitations. As an example, a randomized trial included 120 patients with refractory radiation proctitis who were assigned to HBO or to a sham procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-radiation-proctitis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. The clinical response rate was significantly higher in the intervention group as compared with the sham control group (89 versus 63 percent). In addition, symptom improvement was accompanied by a decreased requirement for other treatments. However, the study was potentially limited by a large number of dropouts after allocation and unclear blinding. The mechanism of action of HBO, technique, and complications associated with HBO therapy are discussed in detail, separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperbaric-oxygen-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperbaric oxygen therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hormonal therapy</strong> &ndash; There are limited data to support the use of hormonal therapy with estrogen (with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a>) in patients with chronic radiation proctitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-radiation-proctitis/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. However, side effects of hormonal therapy observed during treatment of patients with angiodysplasias are common, and reports of the efficacy of therapy have been conflicting.

A small uncontrolled study involving 10 patients suggested that treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-e-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin E</a> (400 international units three times daily) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-c-ascorbic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin C</a> (500 mg three times daily) was associated with improvement in diarrhea and urgency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-radiation-proctitis/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. The high dropout rate in the study, relatively subjective endpoints used, and absence of a control group make it difficult to draw any conclusions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A potential role for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin A</a> was suggested in a pilot randomized trial in which 18 patients with radiation proctitis were assigned to oral retinol palmitate or placebo for 90 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-radiation-proctitis/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. Patients randomized to retinol palmitate were significantly more likely to respond as compared with placebo (70 versus 22 percent). In addition, five nonresponders who initially received placebo subsequently responded when treated with retinol palmitate. Larger studies are needed to validate these results.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><strong>5-aminosalicylic acid</strong> &ndash; There is no clear role for 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) enemas in patients with chronic radiation proctitis. Although some reports and anecdotal experience have suggested that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a> and aminosalicylates may be successful in treating chronic radiation proctitis, the results in other series have been conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-radiation-proctitis/abstract/75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,76</a>].

Acute radiation proctitis occurs during and within six weeks of radiation therapy. Chronic radiation proctitis has a more delayed onset. The first symptoms often occur 9 to 14 months following radiation exposure but can occur any time post-irradiation up to 30 years after exposure. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute radiation proctitis is caused by direct mucosal damage from radiation exposure. Chronic radiation proctitis is due to progressive epithelial atrophy and fibrosis associated with obliterative endarteritis and chronic mucosal ischemia. Risk factors for radiation proctitis include the dose of radiation, area of exposure, and method of delivery. (See <a href=\"#H524513992\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H524514087\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms of acute radiation proctitis include diarrhea, mucus discharge, urgency, tenesmus, and, uncommonly, bleeding. Patients with chronic radiation proctitis have symptoms similar to those of patients with acute radiation proctitis, but bleeding is usually more severe. In addition, patients may have symptoms of obstructed defecation due to strictures, particularly constipation, rectal pain, urgency, and, rarely, fecal incontinence due to overflow. (See <a href=\"#H610740079\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Acute radiation proctitis should be suspected in patients with diarrhea, mucus discharge, urgency, tenesmus, or bleeding during or within six weeks of radiation therapy. Chronic radiation proctitis should be suspected in patients who have the above clinical features nine months or more after pelvic radiation exposure. Since the clinical features of radiation proctitis are nonspecific, establishing the diagnosis also requires the exclusion of other causes of colitis by history, laboratory studies, endoscopy, and, if permissible, biopsies of the rectum. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Rectal biopsies should be performed judiciously depending upon the dose and fractionation of previous pelvic radiation therapy and in consultation with a radiation oncologist. If performed, biopsies should be directed at the posterior and lateral walls to avoid the irradiated areas. (See <a href=\"#H610740027\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with acute radiation proctitis, treatment is supportive (eg, hydration and antidiarrheals as needed). Butyrate enemas may accelerate healing in acute radiation proctitis. (See <a href=\"#H524509853\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with chronic radiation proctitis, selection among the treatment should be based upon the type of symptoms and their severity and experience within the treatment center. Specific therapy may not be necessary in those who have only mild symptoms, such as occasional hematochezia or mild tenesmus. (See <a href=\"#H524514102\" class=\"local\">'Disease course'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with persistent or severe bleeding due to chronic radiation proctitis, we suggest an initial trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sucralfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sucralfate</a> enemas (20 mL of a 10 percent sucralfate suspension in water twice daily) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In patients who fail to respond to sucralfate therapy for four weeks, we suggest a trial of endoscopic therapy with argon plasma coagulation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Aggressive endoscopic therapy in the setting of prostate necrosis may be associated with an increased risk of fistula formation. Therefore, the timing of endoscopic therapy should be coordinated with a radiation oncologist and urologist. (See <a href=\"#H524514538\" class=\"local\">'Bleeding, rectal pain, and tenesmus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with tenesmus or rectal pain, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sucralfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sucralfate</a> or glucocorticoid enemas (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). While 5-ASA or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a> continue to be used in clinical practice, evidence supporting their benefit in this setting is limited. (See <a href=\"#H524514538\" class=\"local\">'Bleeding, rectal pain, and tenesmus'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Sucralfate enema'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with mild obstructive symptoms related to strictures, we suggest stool softeners (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In patients with continued symptoms despite stool softeners and narrow strictures, we suggest balloon or Savary-Gilliard dilation provided that the strictured segment is short (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
