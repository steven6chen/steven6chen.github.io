Respiratory symptoms are not prominent initially; the cough at first is mild and only slightly productive. The sputum may be blood streaked, but gross hemoptysis is rare. Chest pain can occur in some patients and, if accompanied by hemoptysis, may lead to an erroneous diagnosis of pulmonary embolus.

This mild form of <em>Legionella</em> infection is often referred to as Pontiac fever. The symptoms include fever, malaise, chills, fatigue, and headache, without any respiratory complaints. Chest radiograph is unrevealing. The mean incubation period is 36 hours, much shorter than the 2 to 10 days for Legionnaires' disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-legionella-infection/abstract/13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15</a>].

Bacteremia leads to dissemination of the organism to other sites. The most common extrapulmonary site is the heart; numerous reports of myocarditis, pericarditis, and even prosthetic valve endocarditis have been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-legionella-infection/abstract/16,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18,19</a>].

However, most studies reporting coinfection have used serologic tests as the basis for diagnosis, and such tests may be nonspecific. On the other hand, one group described five patients with <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> bacteremia who had coinfection with <em>Legionella </em>as defined by urine antigen or antibody seroconversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-legionella-infection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIFIC LABORATORY DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prompt diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease can save lives.

Because the clinical presentation of Legionnaires' disease is nonspecific, specialized diagnostic laboratory tests are the key feature for diagnosing Legionnaires' disease. Hospitals where <em>Legionella</em> diagnostic tests were available on-site were more likely to identify hospital-acquired Legionnaires' disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-legionella-infection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Among the species in the Legionellaceae family, <em>L. pneumophila</em> is responsible for 90 percent of infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-legionella-infection/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Culture on selective media</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The single most important test for Legionnaires' disease is isolation of the organism by culture. When Legionnaires' disease is suspected, both a urinary antigen test and <em>Legionella</em> culture of a respiratory specimen should be ordered. The availability of the clinical isolate from culture can be critical for subsequent epidemiologic investigations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-legionella-infection/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>The standard media for <em>Legionella</em> isolation from contaminated clinical specimens is buffered charcoal yeast extract (BCYE) agar supplemented with polymyxin, anisomycin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a>, and dyes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61367\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61367 \">picture 1</a>); the antimicrobial agents prevent the overgrowth of <em>Legionella</em> by competing organisms, while the dyes impart a distinctive color to the <em>Legionella</em> organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-legionella-infection/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The presence of the dyes makes identification of <em>L. micdadei</em> and <em>L. maceachernii</em> easier. Their colonies will appear blue due to uptake of the dye bromothymol blue, whereas <em>L. pneumophila</em> will appear apple-green [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-legionella-infection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Maximal sensitivity for clinical specimens is achieved by the simultaneous use of three media: BCYE; BCYE with polymyxin, anisomycin, and cefamandole (PAC); and BCYE with polymyxin, anisomycin, vancomycin, and dyes (PAV). Dyes, glycine, vancomycin, polymyxin (DGVP) media is a selective media used for environmental water cultures for <em>Legionella</em>. Glycine and the antibacterial agents suppress the growth of competing microflora, which would otherwise overwhelm and minimize the growth of <em>Legionella</em> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F93820\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93820 \">picture 2</a>). All four media (BCYE, PAC, PAV, and DGVP) are commercially available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Urinary antigen testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among reported cases of Legionnaires' disease, there has been a significant increase in the proportion diagnosed by the urinary antigen test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-legionella-infection/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In many hospitals, cases of Legionnaires' disease due to <em>L. pneumophila</em> serogroup 1 are often diagnosed by urinary antigen rather than by direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) staining or culture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F69022\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69022 \">table 1</a>). In addition, the introduction of the urinary antigen test into many hospital laboratories has resulted in the detection of unrecognized endemic nosocomial outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-legionella-infection/abstract/22,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,30</a>].</p><p>The urinary antigen test has several advantages over culture:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For many patients with Legionnaires' disease, obtaining an adequate sputum specimen can be difficult.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The fact that test positivity can persist for days even during administration of antibiotic therapy makes it useful in patients who receive empiric anti-<em>Legionella </em>therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The results of the urinary antigen test can be available within hours, whereas culture results require three to five days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-legionella-infection/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p>The major disadvantage of the urinary antigen test is that it is specific for <em>L. pneumophila</em> serogroup 1 only. However, the vast majority of Legionnaires' disease cases from the community are caused by this species and serogroup [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-legionella-infection/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>].</p><p>Several urine antigen tests are commercially available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-legionella-infection/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The antigen may be detected by two primary methods: the enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and the immunochromatographic test (ICT). Both urine antigen tests (EIA and ICT) have comparable sensitivity of 80 percent and specificity of 97 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-legionella-infection/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. The ICT test will yield a result for a single specimen in approximately 15 minutes and is performed using a swab that has been dipped in urine and inserted into the card-type test device. The reaction is read as the presence or absence of a visually detectable pink-to-purple colored line that results from the antigen-antibody reaction. The EIA requires approximately 90 minutes and uses a microtiter format and can test many specimens within one microtiter plate.</p><p>In a comparative study, the sensitivity of the BinaxNOW ICT was higher than the SAS ICT (100 versus 85 percent, respectively); specificity was 100 percent for both tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-legionella-infection/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>A high sensitivity and specificity for the EIA assay has been reported by the manufacturers. However, sensitivity may vary with severity of disease. Test performance can be illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study conducted during a large outbreak (295 cases) of <em>Legionella</em> pneumonia in Spain, the overall sensitivity of the test was only 48 percent (case confirmed by a positive culture for <em>Legionella</em> or fourfold rise in antibody titer) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-legionella-infection/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Sensitivity was significantly higher in patients with severe compared with mild pneumonia (86 versus 38 percent). Thus, many patients with mild pneumonia may go undiagnosed if the urinary antigen test is used alone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a large outbreak in Oklahoma resulting from exposure in an indoor pool and hot tub area, 101 of 107 patients had Pontiac fever, the milder form of <em>L. pneumophila</em> serogroup 1 infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-legionella-infection/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>] (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Pontiac fever'</a> above). The urine antigen test had a sensitivity of 36 percent and specificity of 100 percent, whereas prior small studies had a sensitivity less than 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-legionella-infection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p>There have been reports of positive urine antigen test results in Legionnaires' disease due to non-serogroup 1 <em>L. pneumophila</em> and other species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-legionella-infection/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. However, the sensitivity and specificity of the urine test for detecting other serogroups and species is currently unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">DFA staining</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reported sensitivity of DFA stains on respiratory specimens has ranged from 25 to 75 percent. It is highly specific, and the monoclonal antibody test has eliminated the rare occurrence of cross-reactivity with other gram-negative bacilli. DFA may be performed if the direct culture of the specimen is overgrown by competing microflora. We have found the monoclonal antibody DFA reagent (MONOFLUO, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Redmond, WA) to be superior to polyclonal reagents for detecting <em>L. pneumophila</em> in respiratory specimens because background fluorescence is reduced and cross-reactivity with non-<em>Legionella</em> bacteria has not occurred in our experience.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Serology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibody tests have become less important with the advent of rapid diagnostic tests, such as urinary antigen testing, DFA staining, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Because the definitive criterion for serologic diagnosis is a fourfold rise in antibody titer, repeat serology is required 8 to 12 weeks after the onset of infection. Indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) are the most commonly used methodologies for <em>L. pneumophila</em> serology.</p><p>A fourfold rise to &ge;128 in titer between the acute and convalescent titer is required for a definitive serologic diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-legionella-infection/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The optimal period for seroconversion is 12 weeks. Use of both immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG assays maximizes sensitivity since one of the tests may reveal evidence of <em>Legionella </em>infection while the other does not. Effective antibiotics and suboptimal timing of specimen collection are possible reasons for the lower reported sensitivity of this test in some studies. Twenty-five to 40 percent of patients may have elevated titers in the first week of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-legionella-infection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Some patients never demonstrate a fourfold increase in titer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-legionella-infection/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Sensitivity and specificity have been reported to be approximately 75 and 95 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-legionella-infection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Serology is useful in epidemiologic studies but is less helpful to the clinician in making an immediate diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease for an individual patient. A single elevated titer does not confirm a case of Legionnaires' disease because IFA titers of &ge;1:256 have been found in 1 to 16 percent of healthy adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-legionella-infection/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], and the positive predictive value of a convalescent-phase titer is unacceptably low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-legionella-infection/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Nevertheless, in a patient with an acute episode of pneumonia, a single elevated titer of 1:128 or higher may be sufficient to mandate treatment or to classify the infection as &quot;presumptive&quot; in an epidemiological investigation. Likewise, if the seroprevalence of <em>L. pneumophila</em> antibody titers within the community is known to be low, a single elevated titer (1:256) may indicate the presence of acute disease. False-positive results can rarely occur as a result of cross-reacting antibody to other gram-negative organisms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Polymerase chain reaction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DNA amplification by PCR of <em>Legionella</em> has been reported from patients with pneumonia using throat swab specimens, bronchoalveolar lavage, urine, and serum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-legionella-infection/abstract/18,45-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,45-48</a>]. To date, clinical experience has not shown PCR to be more sensitive than culture, and therefore the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend the routine use of genetic probes or PCR for the detection of <em>Legionella</em> in clinical samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-legionella-infection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to diagnosis</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While a number of prominent clinical manifestations are distinctive for <em>Legionella</em> infection, none of them are pathognomonic or highly specific.

Legionellosis refers to the two clinical syndromes caused by bacteria of the genus <em>Legionella</em>:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Legionnaires' disease is the more common syndrome of pneumonia caused by <em>Legionella</em> species</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pontiac fever is an acute, febrile, self-limited illness that has been linked to <em>Legionella</em> species (see <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pneumonia is the predominant clinical manifestation of <em>Legionella</em> infection. In epidemiologic studies, <em>Legionella</em> is consistently reported among the top three or four most commonly identified pathogens in community-acquired pneumonia in immunocompetent patients and is also a common cause of hospital-acquired pneumonia. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory symptoms are not prominent initially in patients with Legionnaires' disease. The cough at first is mild and only slightly productive. The sputum may be blood streaked, but gross hemoptysis is rare. Chest pain can occur in some patients and, if accompanied by hemoptysis, may lead to an erroneous diagnosis of pulmonary embolus. Gastrointestinal symptoms are often prominent with diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Patients are commonly lethargic with headache and occasionally stupor. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical examination reveals rales with subsequent signs of consolidation. Fever is virtually always present, and oral temperature greater than 39&ordm;C should suggest the possibility of Legionnaires' disease. Miscellaneous findings include disseminated intravascular coagulation, glomerulitis, rhabdomyolysis, various rashes, and neuropathies; these are nonspecific findings that may be related to the severity of infection, underlying disease, or perhaps side effects of drug therapies. (See <a href=\"#H21953756\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory abnormalities are common but nonspecific, including renal and hepatic dysfunction, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, and hypophosphatemia. Hyponatremia (serum sodium &lt;130 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> occurs significantly more frequently in Legionnaires' disease than in pneumonias of other etiologies. Hematuria and proteinuria are also common. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Virtually all patients with Legionnaires' disease have radiographic abnormalities by the third day of illness. The most common pattern is a patchy unilobar infiltrate that progresses to consolidation; however, all types of infiltrates have been reported, including diffuse, interstitial infiltrates. Pleural effusions are also commonplace. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Chest radiograph'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pontiac fever is a mild form of <em>Legionella</em> infection that is characterized by fever, malaise, chills, fatigue, and headache, without any respiratory complaints. Chest radiograph is unrevealing. The mean incubation period is 36 hours, much shorter than the 2 to 10 days for Legionnaires' disease. The illness is usually self-limited. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Pontiac fever'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While a number of prominent clinical manifestations are distinctive for <em>Legionella</em> infection, none of them are pathognomonic or highly specific. Thus, laboratory testing using specialized tests for <em>Legionella</em> should be performed on all patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia. Culturing for <em>Legionella</em> spp is the single most important laboratory test. Urinary antigen testing is rapid, sensitive, specific, and not costly but is only useful for the diagnosis of <em>L. pneumophila</em> type 1 infection (which accounts for 90 percent of community-acquired <em>Legionella</em> infections in the United States). In patients suspected of having <em>Legionella</em> infection, we recommend that both culture of an appropriate respiratory specimen and urinary antigen testing be obtained.
