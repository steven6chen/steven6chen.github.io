However, no single regimen is regarded as optimal for all patients with LN, and treatment must be individualized. Combined immunosuppressive therapy is typically indicated in patients with diffuse and focal proliferative LN and in many patients with lupus membranous nephropathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-classification-of-renal-disease-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and classification of renal disease in systemic lupus erythematosus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-therapy-of-lupus-membranous-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and therapy of lupus membranous nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some patients are truly resistant to initial immunosuppressive treatments despite full compliance with the prescribed regimen. By contrast, a greater number of patients are perceived to have resistant LN.</p><p>Relapsing LN is substantially more common than resistant disease. Nearly one-half of patients with proliferative LN who initially achieve a complete response on immunosuppressive therapy will have a relapse (also called renal flare) following reduction in or cessation of immunosuppression. </p><p>The treatment of resistant and relapsing LN will be reviewed here. The treatment of proliferative LN and lupus membranous nephropathy, as well as issues related to end-stage LN, are presented separately.

As noted above, true resistant disease is uncommon. Perceived resistance, which is more common, is often due to incomplete compliance or noncompliance with the prescribed immunosuppressive regimen or to inadequacy of the prescribed regimen. </p><p>There are two major issues involved in proliferative lupus nephritis (LN) that is resistant to induction therapy: the definition of complete response; and the treatment of resistant disease. In addition, one must consider the risks of overly aggressive therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Definition of complete response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no consensus on the optimal definition of complete response with immunosuppressive therapy in patients with proliferative LN. As a result, the reported incidence of &quot;resistant&quot; LN is variable. </p><p>Resistance to induction therapy is most often defined as the failure to achieve either a complete or partial response and is associated with a worse long-term prognosis compared with patients who attain a complete response. Assessment for the development of complete response usually requires a minimum of six months and, in some patients, as long as 12 months or more after the initiation of induction therapy.</p><p>The definition of complete response in patients with proliferative LN is discussed in detail elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-diffuse-or-focal-proliferative-lupus-nephritis#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of diffuse or focal proliferative lupus nephritis&quot;, section on 'Goal of immunosuppressive therapy'</a>). The goal of immunosuppressive therapy is to abolish active immunologic disease. Most clinical definitions of complete response incorporate a reduction in urine protein excretion, improvement or stabilization of the serum creatinine, and improvement of the urinary sediment.</p><p>A repeat renal biopsy should be performed when it is unclear whether or not the patient is responding to immunosuppressive therapy, specifically when it may lead to a change in therapeutic intervention.

In general, we treat cyclophosphamide-resistant patients with MMF, and MMF-resistant patients with cyclophosphamide.

However, when monitoring for relapse in patients with proliferative LN, one study found that spot UPCR measurements were associated with false-positive and false-negative results compared with ratios obtained on 24-hour urine collections, primarily in patients with subnephrotic proteinuria (24-hour protein-to-creatinine ratio less than 3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapy-of-resistant-or-relapsing-diffuse-or-focal-proliferative-lupus-nephritis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. As an example, a 24-hour urine UPCR of 1 was associated with spot UPCRs ranging from 0 to 2.5. The correlation was much better at 24-hour UPCRs above 3. Thus, if the UPCR increases, a 24-hour urine collection should be obtained on the same day as a spot sample to verify the change in protein excretion and to determine the correlation between the UPCR and total protein excretion.

Perceived resistance is more common than true resistance and is often due to incomplete compliance or noncompliance with the prescribed immunosuppressive regimen or to inadequacy of the prescribed regimen. Assessment for the development of complete response usually requires a minimum of six months and, in many patients, as long as 12 months or more after the initiation of induction therapy. The definition of complete response in patients with proliferative LN is discussed in detail elsewhere.
