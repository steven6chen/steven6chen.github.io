The diagnosis, evaluation, and management of FGR during pregnancy are discussed separately.

These include small for gestational age (SGA) and fetal (intrauterine) growth restriction (FGR). These two terms, although related since they may include many of the same infants, are not the same.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H625978630\"><span class=\"h2\">Small for gestational age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Small for gestational age (SGA) is defined as infants with a BW below the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile for gestational age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75060\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75060 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infants-with-fetal-intrauterine-growth-restriction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, this definition does not make a distinction among SGA infants who are constitutionally normally small from those who are growth-restricted and small. Constitutionally small infants are those with a normal BW below 10<sup>th</sup> percentile due to constitutional factors including maternal height, weight, ethnicity, and parity. These infants are not at increased risk for perinatal mortality or morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infants-with-fetal-intrauterine-growth-restriction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H625978636\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal growth restriction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fetal growth restriction (FGR) refers to the fetus who does not achieve the expected in utero growth potential due to genetic or environmental factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F99966\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99966 \">table 2</a>). It is defined as an estimated fetal weight &lt;10<sup>th</sup> percentile (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal growth restriction: Diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Definition'</a>). Clinically, most infants with FGR are identified because they are born SGA with a BW below the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile for gestational age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75060\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75060 \">table 1</a>). Moderate FGR is defined as BW in the 3<sup>rd</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> percentile, and severe FGR as less than the 3<sup>rd</sup> percentile.</p><p>However, the substitution of SGA for FGR is imprecise. As noted above, using the SGA criteria do not distinguish the constitutionally small fetus that achieves its normal growth potential from similarly small infants with intrauterine growth restriction whose BW is lower than the expected optimal BW. In addition, using SGA as the marker for FGR will miss infants with FGR who have BWs that are greater than the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile. As a result, customized fetal growth curves based on constitutional factors have been developed to help differentiate between SGA infants who are normally small from those with FGR. The use of these curves and the ongoing challenge of distinguishing between these two groups are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal growth restriction: Diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Customized growth curves'</a>.)</p><p>In FGR, the nutrient supply to the fetus is compromised. The fetus, in order to increase its chance of survival, responds by reducing its overall size, preserving brain growth, accelerating lung maturation, and increasing red blood cell production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infants-with-fetal-intrauterine-growth-restriction/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The fetus redirects blood flow from less vital organs to the brain, heart, adrenal glands, and placenta. Total body fat, lean mass, and bone mineral content are reduced, resulting in a wasted appearance in infants with severe FGR (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53832\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53832 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infants-with-fetal-intrauterine-growth-restriction/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Nitrogen and protein content are lower because of reduced muscle mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infants-with-fetal-intrauterine-growth-restriction/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Glycogen content is decreased in skeletal muscle and liver because of lower fetal plasma glucose and insulin concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infants-with-fetal-intrauterine-growth-restriction/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The risk of mortality and morbidity is increased in infants with FGR because of the compromised growth and reduced energy reserves that increase the vulnerability of these infants during the stressful perinatal period with the transition from intrauterine to extrauterine life.

Symmetric FGR begins early in gestation and usually is caused by intrinsic factors such as congenital infections or chromosomal abnormalities. However, decreased nutrient supply early in development can restrict growth of all organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infants-with-fetal-intrauterine-growth-restriction/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Asymmetric FGR</strong> &ndash; Infants with asymmetric FGR have disproportionate growth restriction in which head circumference is preserved, length is somewhat affected, and weight is compromised to a greater degree. As a result, the normal-sized head appears relatively large compared with the size of the trunk and extremities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78143\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78143 \">picture 2</a>). Abnormal growth typically begins in the late second or third trimesters and results from reductions in fetal nutrients that limit glycogen and fat storage, yet allow continued brain growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infants-with-fetal-intrauterine-growth-restriction/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Ponderal index</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, weight parameters at birth are not sensitive measures to detect FGR.

Decreased growth of adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, the major contributors to body weight, results in a reduced PI. PI of less than the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile reflects fetal malnutrition; PI of less than the 3<sup>rd</sup> percentile indicates severe wasting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infants-with-fetal-intrauterine-growth-restriction/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Other measures of body proportion ratios (eg, head circumference to weight, length, or abdominal circumference; or femur length to abdominal circumference) have also been used to detect FGR. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal growth restriction: Diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Body proportions'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of fetal growth restriction (FGR) varies among populations and increases with decreasing gestational age. In addition, it is challenging to interpret the literature as some studies use the term small for gestational age (SGA), which may include both infants who are FGR as well as those who are constitutionally normally small. </p><p>Nevertheless, it appears that FGR is more prevalent in resource-limited countries. Approximately 10 percent of term infants in developed countries are SGA, compared with 20 percent of term infants in developing countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infants-with-fetal-intrauterine-growth-restriction/abstract/4,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7,8</a>]. In 2012, data from the Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group (CHERG) based on 14 birth cohorts and using International Fetal and Newborn Growth Consortium for the 21<sup>st</sup> Century (INTERGROWTH-21<sup>st</sup>) birth weight (BW) standard (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F96940\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96940 \">table 3</a>) showed that SGA was observed in 19.3 percent of live births in low and middle income countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infants-with-fetal-intrauterine-growth-restriction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In this report, 22 percent of neonatal deaths occurred in infants born SGA.</p><p>For preterm infants, the incidence varies depending upon whether data collection is based on BW <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> gestational age. In the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Neonatal Research Network database, 22 percent of 4438 infants with BW 500 to 1500 g were classified as SGA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infants-with-fetal-intrauterine-growth-restriction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In a larger series of 20,000 very low birth weight (VLBW) infants (BW below 1500 g) in which the gestational age was restricted to 25 to 30 weeks, the incidence of SGA was only 9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infants-with-fetal-intrauterine-growth-restriction/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

However, no underlying etiology is identified in at least 40 percent of infants with FGR. In those infants where an underlying cause is identified, FGR is caused by genetic disease in approximately one-third of infants, and is related to the fetal environment in two-thirds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infants-with-fetal-intrauterine-growth-restriction/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H625979020\"><span class=\"h2\">Antenatal detection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The antenatal detection of fetal growth restriction (FGR) has increased with a greater emphasis by obstetricians on identifying fetuses with poor intrauterine growth. However, antenatal diagnosis based on sonographic evaluation of the fetus, placenta, and amniotic fluid remains challenging and is discussed separately.

However, this presentation is less common, in part due to increased antenatal surveillance and the avoidance of postterm gestation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postterm-infant\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postterm infant&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postterm-infant#H87974884\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postterm infant&quot;, section on 'Fetal growth restriction'</a>). The face of severally affected infants has a typical shrunken or &quot;wizened&quot; appearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53832\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53832 \">picture 1</a>), and the umbilical cord often is thin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infants-with-fetal-intrauterine-growth-restriction/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Cranial sutures may be widened, and the anterior fontanelle is larger than expected due to diminished membranous bone formation. Meconium staining may be present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78143\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78143 \">picture 2</a>). In newborns with asymmetric FGR, the head appears relatively large compared with the size of the trunk and extremities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78143\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78143 \">picture 2</a>).

As an example, infants with FGR have increased desquamation and enhanced wrinkling (and more mature appearance) of the soles of the feet. The neurologic assessment remains consistent with the gestational age in FGR infants without an underlying disorder that affects the nervous system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H625978918\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of fetal growth restriction (FGR) is most commonly made when the birth weight (BW) is below the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile for gestational age (ie, the definition of small for gestational age [SGA]). As noted above, there are pitfalls in this approach as it does not distinguish SGA infants who are constitutionally normally small from those with FGR, and it fails to identify infants with FGR who have BWs above the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile but who still had abnormally poor in utero growth.</p><p>As a result, it is important for the clinician to confirm the diagnosis of FGR by identifying other clinical features suggestive of poor intrauterine growth. These include a significant discrepancy between the actual weight and the expected optimal weight based on maternal stature, ethnicity, and parity; physical findings of malnourishment (eg, decreased skeletal muscle mass and subcutaneous fat tissue, and excessive skin desquamation); or evidence of asymmetric growth with a low ponderal index (PI).

As a result, guidelines outlining long-term care for children and adults with FGR are not feasible.</p><p>Our clinical practice is affiliated with a strong network of primary care pediatricians who are able to provide high level care to infants with complex medical issues who are discharged from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). As a result, most infants with FGR who are discharged from our hospital are followed by their primary care provider. During these routine visits, growth parameters (height, weight, and head circumference) are measured. In cases in which there is suboptimal growth, further interventions include nutrient supplementation and possible referral to a feeding specialist. In addition, routine neurodevelopmental screening may identify at-risk infants for neurodevelopmental impairment, who should be referred by their primary care providers for further evaluation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> early intervention services.

Infants with FGR are at increased risk for significant morbidity and mortality compared with infants with normal intrauterine growth. FGR is defined as an estimated fetal weight &lt;10<sup>th</sup> percentile. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal growth restriction: Diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Definition'</a> and <a href=\"#H625978636\" class=\"local\">'Fetal growth restriction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many infants with FGR are identified antenatally by sonographic evaluation. Newborn infants with FGR typically appear thin with loose, peeling skin, and decreased skeletal muscle mass and subcutaneous fat tissue. The face generally has a shrunken or &quot;wizened&quot; appearance, and the umbilical cord often is thin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53832\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53832 \">picture 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The neonatal diagnosis of FGR is most commonly made when the birth weight (BW) is below the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile for gestational age (ie, the definition of small for gestational age [SGA]) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75060\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75060 \">table 1</a>). However, there are pitfalls in this approach as it does not distinguish SGA infants who are constitutionally normally small (who are not at increased risk for perinatal mortality or morbidity) from those with FGR, and it fails to identify infants with FGR who have BW that is above the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile. As a result, it is important for the clinician to confirm the diagnosis of FGR by identifying other clinical features suggestive of poor intrauterine growth. (See <a href=\"#H625978918\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neonatal complications associated with FGR include prematurity, perinatal asphyxia, poor thermoregulation, hypoglycemia, polycythemia resulting in hyperviscosity, and impaired immune function. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial management of a neonate with FGR in the delivery room is supportive and is focused on preventing or addressing the associated complications. (See <a href=\"#H625979840\" class=\"local\">'Delivery room management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If a fetus is known to be severely growth restricted, we suggest that delivery should be planned at a perinatal center with experienced pediatric staffing (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For severely affected cases, the pediatric delivery team should be prepared to manage any infant with perinatal depression, meconium aspiration, hypoglycemia, myocardial dysfunction, and hypoxia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We recommend that all infants with FGR should be immediately dried and placed under a radiant heat warmer to prevent hypothermia (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Depending on the clinical status, the infant can be admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit if the patient requires more extensive care or monitoring than the routine care provided in the normal nursery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the nursery, management includes the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Blood glucose monitoring in neonates with FGR initiated within one to two hours after birth. Surveillance is continued in infants with low plasma glucose concentrations (less than 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> 2.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> until feedings are well established and glucose values have normalized. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-screening-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-hypoglycemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, screening, and diagnosis of neonatal hypoglycemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An ionized calcium level in SGA infants who are preterm or who experienced birth asphyxia starting at 12 hours after birth. These infants are at risk for hypocalcemia, and ionized calcium levels should be monitored.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-polycythemia#H4356714\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal polycythemia&quot;, section on 'Which infants should be screened?'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Enteral feeding should be started early in infants with FGR at volumes appropriate for the infant's weight. Mother's breast milk is preferred over formula because of its additional short-term and long-term benefits.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the infant is stabilized, further evaluation to determine the cause of FGR should be performed for infants in whom the underlying etiology remains unknown (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F99966\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99966 \">table 2</a>). However, in the majority of cases, no underlying cause is identified.

However, there is significant heterogeneity in long-term outcome. In addition, individuals who were SGA infants may be predisposed to cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) as adults. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term management includes monitoring growth and neurodevelopmental outcome, which is typically provided by the primary care provider.
