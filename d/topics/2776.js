Outcomes of these procedures when performed by a gynecologic oncologist have been shown to be better than when the procedure is performed by other surgeons.

In women with suspected or confirmed ovarian, fallopian tubal, or peritoneal carcinoma, a detailed family history of other malignancies should be elicited.

The new staging system merges ovarian, fallopian tubal, and peritoneal carcinomas. Of note, it is not possible to have stage I peritoneal carcinoma.</p><p>Staging at sites has been combined, but there is great diversity across histologic subtypes. Carcinomas of the ovary, tube, and peritoneum are no longer regarded as a single entity, but as a heterogenous set of diseases that vary in pathogenesis, histology, and clinical behavior. The five main histologic types are: high-grade serous, endometrioid, clear cell, mucinous, and low-grade serous. High-grade serous carcinomas comprise 70 percent of ovarian, fallopian tubal, and peritoneal carcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. There is increasing evidence that the site of origin of many high-grade serous pelvic carcinomas is the fallopian tube. The pathogenesis and histopathology of these carcinomas are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of ovarian, fallopian tubal, and peritoneal serous carcinomas&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-histopathology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Histopathology&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the 2013 staging system, the following recommendations and changes were made [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Histologic type and grade should be recorded.

Stage IIIA1(i) is up to 10 mm deposit and IIIA1(ii) is greater than 10 mm in greatest dimension.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage IV has been subdivided into malignant pleural effusion (IVA) and parenchymal liver metastases or metastases to extraabdominal organs (IVB) (including inguinal lymph node and lymph nodes outside the abdominal cavity).</p><p/><p>In addition, the primary site of origin should be noted (ovary, tube, or peritoneum) whenever possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>].

One-third of tumors with bilateral involvement will have a large tumor on one ovary and a normal-size ovary on the other side with superficial tumor foci, suggesting that these foci may be metastatic; in such cases, the stage would be IB, not IC2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10115908\"><span class=\"h2\">Surface involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surface involvement of the ovary or fallopian tube is defined as exposure of neoplastic cells to the peritoneal cavity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This usually takes the form of exophytic papillary tumor on the surface of the ovary or fallopian tube or on the outer surface of a cystic neoplasm replacing these organs. Rarely, surface involvement may also be an exposed layer of neoplastic epithelium on a smooth ovarian tumor surface. Assessment for surface involvement requires careful gross examination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10115882\"><span class=\"h2\">Capsule rupture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The impact on prognosis of rupture of an ovarian tumor capsule is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. The potential mechanism of poor outcomes after rupture is dissemination of malignant cells via the peritoneal circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Preoperative rupture appears to be associated with a worse prognosis, while the data regarding intraoperative rupture are inconsistent. In the current staging system, surgical spill (IC1) is differentiated from rupture prior to surgery (IC2).</p><p>Patients with disease confined to one or both ovaries who have intraoperative capsule rupture are upgraded from IA or IB to IC1. This is clinically significant because stage IC is usually the threshold for chemotherapy treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-therapy-of-early-stage-stage-i-and-ii-epithelial-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-or-peritoneal-cancer#H21075699\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant therapy of early stage (stage I and II) epithelial ovarian, fallopian tubal, or peritoneal cancer&quot;, section on 'Selection of patients'</a>.)</p><p>Avoidance of intraoperative rupture is the basis of the practice of removing the entire ovary and fallopian tube rather than performing a cystectomy if ovarian cancer is suspected. In addition, historically, there was concern regarding use of laparoscopy to remove an adnexal mass with an uncertain risk of malignant neoplasm. However, intraperitoneal spillage of cells can be minimized in laparoscopic cases with salpingo-oophorectomy and use of a laparoscopic bag. If rupture occurs, copious irrigation should be performed.</p><p>Evidence regarding capsule rupture is limited to small studies with inconsistent results. It appears that preoperative rupture <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other preoperative extracapsular disease (ie, surface capsular invasion, positive peritoneal cytology) are more important in terms of prognosis than intraoperative rupture, but further study is needed. The best available data are from a meta-analysis of nine retrospective studies including 2382 patients with mostly stage I ovarian cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The study found a significantly worse progression-free survival (PFS) associated with preoperative extracapsular disease compared with intraoperative rupture or no rupture in six studies and also in a subset analysis of two studies that included only women with complete surgical staging and adjuvant chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] 2.63, 95% CI 1.11-6.20). However, intraoperative rupture compared with no rupture showed a significant difference in PFS in five studies (HR 2.41, 95% CI 1.74-3.33), but not in the complete staging and chemotherapy subset (HR 1.49, 95% CI 0.45-4.95). The subset analysis lacked statistical power to detect this difference. Thus, the question remains of whether the finding of a worse prognosis with intraoperative rupture is due to rupture or to a missed diagnosis of advanced disease in women who are incompletely staged.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10116038\"><span class=\"h2\">Dense adhesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dense adhesions <strong>with histologically proven neoplastic cells</strong> justify upgrading to stage II. Data are inconsistent regarding whether sharp dissection of dense adhesions in women with an apparent stage I carcinoma results in outcomes equivalent to stage II [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Thus, the recommendation for upgrading is limited to dense adhesions with malignant cells.</p><p>Cytoreductive surgery is the cornerstone of therapy for ovarian, tubal, and peritoneal carcinoma. There are several potential benefits of aggressive primary surgical management in women with epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC), particularly for those with advanced disease:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Optimal response to postoperative systemic chemotherapy is achieved in the setting of minimal disease burden. Chemotherapeutic drugs exert their maximum effects on small tumors that are well-perfused and therefore mitotically active. Larger tumor size is associated with poorer perfusion and a greater chance of sublethal cellular damage as well as the emergence of multidrug-resistant clones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. These pharmacologic principles are supported clinically by the observation that both the relapse-free interval and median survival are inversely related to the size of the largest residual tumor mass at the completion of initial debulking prior to the start of induction chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disease-related symptoms (eg, abdominal pain, increased abdominal girth, dyspnea, early satiety) are related to tumor burden. Removal of bulky disease rapidly improves symptoms and quality of life.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ovarian neoplasms produce multiple cytokines, at least some of which are immunosuppressive (eg, interleukin-10, vascular endothelial growth factor) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. Removal of tumor bulk may improve or restore host immune competence.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10115888\"><span class=\"h1\">STAGING PROCEDURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Total extrafascial hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, pelvic and paraaortic lymph node dissection, and infracolic or infragastric omentectomy is the standard staging procedure for ovarian, fallopian tubal, and peritoneal carcinoma. Peritoneal cytology is collected after the incision is made. Staging also includes assessment of upper abdomen, peritoneal surfaces and large and small bowel mesentery with possible biopsies, and cytology of the diaphragm. Appendectomy may be indicated.</p><p>Laparotomy is generally used, but laparoscopic or robot-assisted approaches are used by some specialized surgeons for selected patients. (See <a href=\"#H541926\" class=\"local\">'Role of laparoscopy'</a> below.)</p><p>Fertility-sparing surgery of the contralateral ovary and uterus may be utilized in rare instances. (See <a href=\"#H401641\" class=\"local\">'Fertility preservation'</a> below.)</p><p>As with other intraabdominal gynecologic malignancies, complete staging includes biopsy of any areas where metastases are suspected. Cytoreduction often is performed when metastases are evident.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Incision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A vertical midline incision is the best approach for laparotomy for staging and cytoreductive surgery. It provides potentially unlimited exposure of the pelvis and abdomen. Pfannenstiel incisions should be avoided, but several options exist if this incision was chosen because of erroneous expectations of benign findings (eg, Maylard or Cherney incision). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=incisions-for-open-abdominal-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Incisions for open abdominal surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Peritoneal cytology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As soon as the peritoneal cavity is entered, any ascites should be collected and a representative sample sent for cytologic evaluation. The identification of a small volume of ascites, as opposed to normal amounts of peritoneal fluid, is subjective. In addition, pelvic washings should be obtained by instilling 50 to 100 mL of saline into the peritoneal cavity and then removing it by suction. Washings of the pelvis, paracolic gutters, and both diaphragms are obtained for staging purposes if ascites or extrapelvic tumor nodules are not identified.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Exploration and biopsies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pelvic and abdominal exploration is carried out in a systematic manner, assessing the status of the pelvic organs, small and large intestine, mesentery, appendix, stomach, liver, gallbladder, spleen, omentum, both diaphragms, and the entire peritoneum. Retroperitoneal structures such as the kidneys, pancreas, and lymph nodes are palpated through the peritoneum and adipose tissue. The umbilicus is carefully palpated, as metastasis to the peritoneal side can occur, and excision is simple.</p><p>The retroperitoneum may be accessed by dividing the round ligament as laterally as possible and then developing the pararectal and paravesical spaces. The pararectal space is developed by sharp dissection between the medial leaflet of the broad ligament and the external and internal iliac vessel, taking care to protect the ureter on the medial leaf and avoiding dissection lateral to the internal iliac artery, which lies inferior and medial to the external iliac vessel.</p><p>The paravesical space is created by sharp dissection toward the pelvic floor between the superior vesical artery and the external iliac vessels. The pelvis can also be entered from the prevesical space or either paracolic gutter. A retroperitoneal approach is best if the pelvis appears &quot;frozen.&quot; This approach allows resection of tumor encroaching on bladder or bowel from a lateral aspect, beneath the bladder and posterior cul de sac reflections.</p><p>Biopsies are taken from all suspicious areas. If suspicious areas are not apparent, multiple random biopsies are taken from peritoneal surfaces, including the posterior cul de sac (pouch of Douglas), bladder peritoneum, paracolic gutters, and bowel mesentery, to help detect micrometastases. Both diaphragms should be biopsied or scraped for cytology. Any adhesions or peritoneal surface irregularities should also be sampled, as tumor may be associated with an inflammatory or desmoplastic reaction.</p><p>Pseudomyxoma peritonei has been reported to be associated with benign, malignant, and borderline tumors of the ovary. The term pseudomyxoma peritonei is used to describe either free mucin deposits or mucin extravasating into tissues in the peritoneal cavity and implants of mucinous epithelium. If pseudomyxoma peritonei is found, careful inspection of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (appendix, small and large intestine, stomach, pancreas) should be performed as a possible primary site.

Resection of the omentum, especially when replaced by densely packed metastases (so-called omental cake), is performed even when optimal cytoreduction is not possible in order to decrease tumor bulk and postoperative ascites formation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F74312\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74312 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p>The peritoneal reflection is separated off the transverse colon, after which the lesser sac is entered and mesentery of the transverse colon is identified and preserved. An infracolic or a complete omentectomy is then performed by isolating the gastroepiploic vessels with Kelly (or equivalent) clamps or by using a surgical stapler or bipolar energy ligating device. If necessary, hepatic and splenic flexures can be mobilized to allow for removal of all of the omentum. Care must be taken to not put undue tension on the spleen while mobilizing the omentum.</p><p>Omental cakes are resected in their entirety by dividing the vascular pedicles close to the transverse colon. The surgeon should not cut across an omental cake, as this leads to troublesome bleeding. When adherent to the abdominal wall, omental cakes can usually be bluntly freed prior to performing omentectomy.</p><p>Resecting pieces of the omentum for pathology should be discouraged.

The rationale is to remove (if present) occult metastases in the contralateral ovary, adnexa, or uterus, or a synchronous primary endometrial cancer. In addition, removal of the uterus facilitates use of postmenopausal hormone therapy, if desired, and evaluation of the pelvis postoperatively. Hysterectomy may also clarify the organ of cancer origin.</p><p>Fertility preservation is not an option for most women. However, if a patient has stage IA disease and desires fertility preservation, unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy may be performed along with staging.

In a series of 141 patients with advanced ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tubal cancer who underwent such procedures, there were two deaths, and major complications occurred in 22 percent of patients; most complications were successfully managed with percutaneous drainage of collections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].</p><p>Parenchymal hepatic metastases are not necessarily a contraindication to initial cytoreductive surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management/abstract/79-81\" class=\"abstract_t\">79-81</a>]. In one series of 84 women with stage IV disease who underwent initial debulking surgery, 37 (44 percent) had parenchymal liver metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. Median survival was highest in women in whom optimal debulking of both intrahepatic and extrahepatic disease was achieved (survival 50 months versus &lt;20 months in women with suboptimal debulking). Nevertheless, the <span class=\"nowrap\">risk/benefit</span> ratio for optimal hepatic cytoreduction may be unfavorable if hepatic disease is bulky or involves major vessels.</p><p>In terms of technique, the most difficult areas should be assessed and approached first. If resection of the bulk of disease appears technically feasible, as it should in most patients, an aggressive surgical approach aimed at resection of all or most visible disease is warranted. A meta-analysis of 81 ovarian cancer patient cohorts by Bristow et al showed that each 10 percent increase in maximal cytoreduction was associated with a 5.5 percent increase in median survival time. Patients with less than 25 percent maximal cytoreduction of disease had overall survival of 22.7 months, while patients with 75 percent or greater maximal cytoreduction had an overall survival of 34 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Pelvic anatomy is frequently distorted in patients with ovarian carcinoma. Resection of confluent, bulky disease by a retroperitoneal technique minimizes the risk of injury to the bladder or ureters and results in excellent access to blood supply.</p><p>Sharp dissection and electrocautery, including aggressive peritoneal stripping of the diaphragm and abdominopelvic surfaces, are the traditional methods used to achieve complete cytoreduction. The cavitational ultrasonic surgical aspirator, carbon dioxide laser, and argon beam coagulator have been used as adjuncts to these conventional techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management/abstract/82-87\" class=\"abstract_t\">82-87</a>]. Each surgeon should select equipment and instruments in accordance with availability and his or her skills.</p><p>Several authors have described an approach called &quot;radical oophorectomy&quot; in patients with locally advanced ovarian cancer with extension to or encasement of the reproductive organs, pelvic peritoneum, cul de sac, and sigmoid colon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. The procedure involves retroperitoneal radical hysterectomy with en bloc resection of the adnexa, cul de sac tumor, involved peritoneum, and any involved rectosigmoid colon. Since ovarian cancer usually does not extend through the peritoneum, the retroperitoneal approach facilitates resection of bulky, confluent pelvic disease. This procedure usually is not appropriate for women who have unresectable upper abdominal disease because of the procedure's high morbidity and low potential for cure in such patients. An exception would be in patients with impending bowel obstruction in which resection or diversion would be appropriate.<br/><br/>The round ligaments are divided as laterally as possible and the lateral broad ligament peritoneum overlying the psoas muscle is incised and the pararectal and perivesical spaces developed. The ureters are exposed and mobilized. Infundibulopelvic ligaments are identified, clamped, cut, and ligated as high as possible out of the pelvis. The uterine artery can be divided laterally or at its origin. The anterior cul de sac peritoneum is incised at the reflection and the bladder is mobilized off the lower uterine segment. If there are implants on the anterior cul de sac peritoneum, the space of Retzius can be developed, the bladder elevated, and tumor sharply dissected off. The remainder of the hysterectomy can then be carried out in a routine fashion. If the posterior cul de sac is obliterated by cancer, disease-free bowel can usually be identified below the peritoneal reflection, since ovarian cancer implants are generally on the peritoneal surface or bowel serosa, leaving retroperitoneal structures intact. Then the cul de sac disease can be approached laterally. In extreme cases, the peritoneum overlying the paracolic gutters may be incised, the retroperitoneum entered, the ureters and vessels identified, and the pelvis entered from above.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Splenectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If tumor nodules extend into the splenic hilum, splenectomy can be justified if optimal cytoreduction is then possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management/abstract/89-91\" class=\"abstract_t\">89-91</a>]. A series of 112 ovarian cancer patients who underwent splenectomy as part of primary or secondary cytoreductive surgery reported perioperative morbidity and mortality of 15 and 5 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. Median survival was 1.8 years.</p><p>The spleen is mobilized and the splenic vessels are ligated, taking care to avoid injury to the tail end of the pancreas. Rarely, it may be necessary to resect the tail if involved by contiguous cancer spread.</p><p>Patients who undergo splenectomy should receive prophylactic vaccines. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of sepsis in the asplenic patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">Partial hepatic resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Very rarely, hepatic disease is present and affects only a segment of a lobe. In these unusual cases, a partial hepatectomy can be performed to achieve optimal cytoreduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. Generally, this can be performed with use of intense cautery, which dissects the liver parenchyma. The parenchyma can be finger fractured along cautery dissection and intact blood vessels ligated as they become accessible. Some surgeons believe the use of an argon beam coagulator is highly effective for obtaining hemostasis after a partial hepatectomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h3\">Diaphragmatic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aggressive cytoreductive surgery includes removal of diaphragmatic disease. Diaphragmatic disease can be approached by stripping or scraping the peritoneal surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. Alternatively, the liver can be partially retracted, the hepatic ligament divided, and the affected portion of the membranous diaphragm resected using ultrasonic dissection, electrocautery, or argon beam laser. In cases where full-thickness involvement of the diaphragm is present, resection of the diaphragm has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management/abstract/93-96\" class=\"abstract_t\">93-96</a>].</p><p>The importance of cytoreduction of the diaphragm was illustrated in a series that included 181 patients with tumor involving the diaphragm in which patients who underwent diaphragm surgery (stripping of the diaphragmatic peritoneum, full or partial thickness diaphragm resection, excision of nodules, or Cavitron Ultrasound Aspiration) had significantly improved five-year overall survival compared with those who did not (53 versus 15 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. The survival advantage for treatment of diaphragm disease was also observed, but to a lesser degree, when only the subset of patients who were optimally cytoreduced was considered (55 versus 28 percent).</p><p>Most complications are due to breaching the pleural cavity and can be managed by chest tube or thoracentesis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h3\">Bowel resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rectosigmoid colon resection should be attempted in women with bulky abdominal disease if the procedure provides an opportunity for maximal cytoreduction or the patient has obstructive symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management/abstract/98-102\" class=\"abstract_t\">98-102</a>]. However, gastrointestinal surgery can add significant morbidity to surgical treatment. A thorough assessment of the intraabdominal findings should be performed prior to attempted resection. Bowel surgery is of little value if there are other areas of grossly unresectable disease, except to relieve gastrointestinal obstruction. Ultraradical surgery, including complex or multiple bowel resections, is associated with substantial morbidity and potential perioperative mortality, particularly in nutritionally depleted patients.</p><p>Rectosigmoid implants constitute the bulk of intestinal involvement in women undergoing primary cytoreductive surgery for epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC). Small-volume disease can be simply shaved off, taking advantage of the fact that these implants are often only superficially invasive. Bulkier implants may require bowel resection and reanastomosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F68932\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68932 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management/abstract/89,99\" class=\"abstract_t\">89,99</a>]. These procedures are indicated only if optimal cytoreduction is possible or if obstruction is present.</p><p>In an unstable patient, if bowel resection is contraindicated or if optimal cytoreduction is not achievable at other sites, an intestinal bypass procedure can be done instead. Proximal and distal bowel is simply approximated without resection of the involved segment, thus bypassing the area of resistance to permit flow of gastrointestinal contents. The procedure is well tolerated and results in palliation but may be associated with blind loop syndrome with bacterial overgrowth or potential risk of perforation. An alternative to surgery is placement of a stent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=small-intestinal-bacterial-overgrowth-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enteral-stents-for-the-management-of-malignant-colorectal-obstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Enteral stents for the management of malignant colorectal obstruction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h3\">Bladder or ureteral resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Resection of the bladder or ureters is rarely necessary to achieve optimal debulking unless the tumor has invaded the bladder or obstructed the ureter, or the ureter is entrapped by pelvic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. Resection of these structures may require complete mobilization of the bladder by dividing lateral peritoneal attachments to accommodate the decreased length of the remaining ureter. Ureteral neocystostomy with psoas hitch provides an excellent result. Initially, these anastomoses are not watertight, and drainage of the pelvis by closed suction is prudent. Placement of ureteral stents is based upon the surgeon's preference, since there is no evidence for or against their use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h3\">Systematic lymphadenectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systematic lymphadenectomy of the pelvic and paraaortic nodes, rather than selective resection of bulky nodes, has been proposed as a component of optimal debulking of women with advanced disease. Two large randomized trials have evaluated this issue and neither showed a statistically significant survival advantage with systematic lymphadenectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management/abstract/103,104\" class=\"abstract_t\">103,104</a>]. However, both trials showed a trend toward a longer progression-free interval with more extensive surgery, suggesting that a modest survival advantage might be demonstrated if a larger number of patients were evaluated.</p><p>We resect all grossly suspicious lymph nodes to achieve maximal resection of disease. We do not routinely perform systematic lymphadenectomy to resect potential sites of microscopic disease, given the lack of proven survival advantage and the morbidity of the procedure. Potential sites of microscopic disease are treated, since most women with EOC receive systemic chemotherapy to treat occult disease.</p><p>The two trials supporting this approach are summarized below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One trial randomly assigned 427 women with stage IIIB to C and IV EOC to undergo either systematic pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy or resection of bulky nodes only [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. All of the patients also underwent aggressive surgical debulking (96 percent had residual disease &le;1 cm), and 88 percent received adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy. The median length of follow-up was 68.4 months. Positive nodes were detected in 70 percent of patients who underwent systematic lymphadenectomy and 42 percent of those who underwent selective sampling.<br/><br/>Five-year survival rates were not significantly different for the two groups (48.4 versus 47 percent); however, systematic lymphadenectomy was associated with a five- to seven-month increase in progression-free survival (PFS). Longer PFS was achieved at a cost of longer median operating times (300 versus 210 minutes), greater blood loss (1000 versus 650 mL), and a higher proportion of patients requiring transfusion (71.7 versus 59.2 percent). Quality of life measures were not assessed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The other trial randomly assigned 268 women with stage I or II EOC to undergo either systematic pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy or random sampling of these nodes (controls) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. All of the patients also underwent aggressive surgical debulking (96 percent had residual disease &le;1 cm), and 61 percent received adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy. The median length of follow-up was 87.8 months. Positive nodes were detected in 22 percent of patients who underwent systematic lymphadenectomy compared with only 9 percent of controls.<br/><br/>There was no significant difference between groups in five-year survival (84.2 versus 81.3 percent in controls) or five-year PFS (78.3 versus 71.3 percent in controls). Systematic lymphadenectomy was associated with longer median operating times (240 versus 150 minutes), greater blood loss (600 versus 300 mL), and a higher proportion of patients requiring transfusion (35.5 versus 21.9 percent). Quality of life measures were not assessed.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h3\">Placement of a port for chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a growing body of evidence showing a survival advantage in women with optimally cytoreduced (&lt;1 cm) stage III epithelial ovarian cancer who are treated with intraperitoneal chemotherapy. The procedure for port placement and this therapy are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intraperitoneal-chemotherapy-for-treatment-of-ovarian-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intraperitoneal chemotherapy for treatment of ovarian cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H541926\"><span class=\"h1\">ROLE OF LAPAROSCOPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laparoscopic surgery has been used by some surgeons for staging or to assess the feasibility of cytoreductive surgery, but mainly for presumed stage I or II ovarian or fallopian tubal cancer.</p><p>Laparoscopic surgical management of ovarian cancer is technically possible but is not considered prudent by many experts. It is usually undertaken in young women with adnexal disease that is initially believed to be benign, but found to be malignant at exploration. Use for staging has mainly been investigated in women with presumed stage I or II disease, in whom cytoreduction is not necessary.</p><p>There have been few high-quality studies about use of laparoscopy for ovarian cancer staging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. A meta-analysis of 11 observational studies of women with presumed stage I or II ovarian cancer found no difference between laparoscopy and laparotomy in operative duration, but laparoscopic surgery was associated with somewhat less blood loss (244 versus 467 mL). There was a low rate of conversion to laparotomy (3.7 percent). Many women were upstaged after laparoscopy (22 percent), but this did not differ significantly from laparotomy in three comparative studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>]. There are no long-term data on effect on progression-free and overall survival between the two techniques for staging procedures.</p><p>The largest study of laparoscopy for debulking following neoadjuvant chemotherapy was a retrospective cohort study that included 3071 women with stage IIIC or IV ovarian cancer who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by debulking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>]. Laparoscopy (n = 450) compared with laparotomy was associated with comparable three-year overall survival (47.5 versus 52.6 percent) and no difference in suboptimal debulking (20.0 versus 22.6 percent), or death within 90 days after surgery (2.8 versus 2.9 percent). Laparoscopy was associated with a shorter hospital stay (median, four versus five days) and no significant difference in 30-day readmission rates (5.3 versus 3.7 percent). This study does not show reduced short-term morbidity as a benefit of laparoscopy, as is often found in studies comparing laparoscopy with laparotomy; however, this may be due to the high rate of morbidity in this patient population. Further study is needed to validate the efficacy of laparoscopic debulking following neoadjuvant chemotherapy and to evaluate whether there is a benefit other than shorter hospital stay.</p><p>Technical concerns regarding use of laparoscopic surgery include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A major concern is that intact removal of the ovarian mass is often not possible and rupture of the mass may worsen prognosis. (See <a href=\"#H10115882\" class=\"local\">'Capsule rupture'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another question is whether the pelvis and abdomen can be inspected as thoroughly as with an open surgical approach.

A thorough abdominal exploration and biopsy of any abnormal areas are also mandatory, and endometrial biopsy should be performed to exclude endometrial cancer. Most surgeons do not routinely biopsy the contralateral ovary if it appears normal. The rationale is that clinically occult bilateral ovarian involvement has been noted in only 2.5 percent of women undergoing staging for ovarian malignancy, and ovarian surgery may impair future fertility, which is the purpose of conservative surgery.</p><p>A review of studies of women with EOC who received conservative treatment included 282 women and 113 deliveries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Staging system'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preoperative testing prior to surgical staging of suspected ovarian, fallopian tubal, or peritoneal cancer may include: imaging and other testing for metastases, tumor markers for diagnosis and as a baseline for posttreatment surveillance, testing for hereditary cancer syndromes (eg, <em>BRCA</em> mutation, Lynch syndrome), and identification of candidates for neoadjuvant chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Total extrafascial hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, and pelvic and paraaortic lymph node dissection is the standard staging procedure. Peritoneal cytology is collected after the incision is made. Staging also includes omentectomy and cytology of the diaphragm. Laparotomy is generally used, but laparoscopic or robot-assisted approaches are used by some surgeons for selected patients. (See <a href=\"#H10115888\" class=\"local\">'Staging procedure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) defines optimal cytoreduction as leaving residual disease &le;1 cm in maximum tumor diameter. The volume of residual disease remaining after cytoreductive surgery inversely correlates with survival; therefore, if it is technically feasible, all visible tumor should be resected (complete cytoreduction) at the initial surgical procedure. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Cytoreduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest cytoreduction to no gross disease rather than &le;1 cm remaining tumor nodules for most women with ovarian, fallopian tubal, or peritoneal carcinoma (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Aggressive surgical efforts to obtain complete cytoreduction may include bowel resection, upper abdominal surgery, diaphragm striping, and splenectomy. Cytoreduction to a lesser extent is a reasonable option if reduction to no gross disease is not possible. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is an option for women who are not candidates for optimal cytoreduction. (See <a href=\"#H7538556\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy and extent of cytoreduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attempts to preserve fertility are most common in young women with ovarian tumors of low malignant potential or nonepithelial ovarian cancers. Fertility preservation is also an option for women with stage IA epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27775842\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The authors and editors would like to recognize Drs.
