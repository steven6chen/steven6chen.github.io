Accurate determination of the cause can lead to etiology-specific therapy and may limit central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction that would otherwise occur if left untreated. In addition, etiology-specific therapy may be necessary to control the seizures themselves.</p><p>While there has been much discussion of the potential adverse effect of seizures on the immature brain, the overriding factor that affects long-term outcome is the etiology of the seizures and the degree and distribution of brain injury caused by the underlying disturbance.</p><p>Most neonatal seizures are due to acute symptomatic causes. However, there is increasing recognition of neonatal-onset epilepsy syndromes. This topic review will discuss recognized neonatal epilepsy syndromes. Acute symptomatic neonatal seizures are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-prognosis-of-neonatal-seizures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and prognosis of neonatal seizures&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The characterization of various types of neonatal seizures, with an emphasis upon clinical features and electrodiagnosis, is discussed elsewhere.

These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benign neonatal convulsions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benign familial neonatal epilepsy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early myoclonic encephalopathy (EME)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>KCNQ2</em> encephalopathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DEND syndrome (Developmental delay, Epilepsy, and Neonatal Diabetes) </p><p/><p>The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) has classified these epilepsy syndromes with the purposes of standardizing terminology and developing a more uniform understanding of the clinical features and consequences of these disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/1-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-7</a>]. In the ILAE scheme, the syndromes are characterized by a cluster of clinical signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings that include seizure type, age of onset, etiology, precipitating factors, severity, ictal and interictal electroencephalogram (EEG) findings, duration of the disorder, associated clinical features, chronicity, response to antiseizure drug therapy, and prognosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F91410\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91410 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ilae-classification-of-seizures-and-epilepsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ILAE classification of seizures and epilepsy&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">BENIGN SYNDROMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two rare but well recognized neonatal seizure syndromes are associated with a relatively good prognosis: benign neonatal convulsions and benign familial neonatal convulsions (BFNC). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Benign neonatal convulsions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a number of terms that have been used to designate benign neonatal convulsions, including &quot;benign idiopathic neonatal seizures&quot; and &quot;fifth day fits&quot; (because of their peak day of onset). No studies clearly link the diagnosis to a specific etiology, although several hypotheses have been investigated: acute zinc deficiency in cerebrospinal fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] and rotavirus in stool of affected infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, the findings of these studies have not been confirmed. Some affected infants are found to have de novo mutations in the <em>KCNQ2</em> gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The reported incidence of benign neonatal convulsions varies widely, although most studies suggest they comprise 2 to 7 percent of neonatal seizures. The incidence has declined since it was first described in the early 1980s. The 2005 to 2009 International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) commission proposed that the category of benign neonatal convulsions be eliminated because of its diminished occurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Seizures occur within the first seven days of life, with 90 percent occurring between days four and six, and they resolve within two weeks. They occur in term or late preterm infants after an uneventful pregnancy, labor, and delivery, with no family history of seizures, and with normal neurologic examinations between seizures.</p><p>The most frequent seizure type is unifocal clonic, and associated apnea has sometimes been reported. Rarely, the seizures have been characterized as focal tonic. There are no reports of generalized tonic seizures. The seizures are typically brief and last from one to three minutes. Although most are self-limited, some do evolve into seizures that are prolonged. In addition, the seizures usually recur during a period of 24 to 48 hours; only rarely do they persist beyond that period.</p><p>The ictal electroencephalogram (EEG) is not distinctive from other electrical or electroclinical seizure types.</p><p>The interictal EEG background can be normal or abnormal with excessive discontinuity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> multifocal negative sharp waves. The EEG pattern most closely associated with benign neonatal convulsions is referred to as &quot;theta pointu alternant&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], and is characterized by nonreactive rhythmic slow activity, discontinuity, interhemispheric asynchrony, and multifocal sharp waves. While this EEG pattern is associated with benign neonatal convulsions, it is not specific; it is found in only about 60 percent of neonates with benign neonatal convulsions and has also been described in other disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Benign neonatal convulsions is currently considered a diagnosis of exclusion, since the initial clinical presentation may mimic that of infants with acute symptomatic seizures. Thus, an extensive evaluation for an acute symptomatic seizure etiology is necessary even when the suspicion for benign neonatal convulsions is considered high. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis of neonatal seizures&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Proposed diagnostic criteria include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apgar score greater than seven at one minute</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Typical interval between birth and seizure onset (four to six days)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal neurologic examination before seizure onset and during the interictal periods</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal laboratory and imaging findings (eg, metabolic studies, neuroimaging, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No family history of neonatal seizures or post neonatal epilepsy</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment and prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The therapy for benign neonatal convulsions is similar to that for other neonatal seizures, with antiseizure drugs acutely administered (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-neonatal-seizures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of neonatal seizures&quot;</a>). Some experts suggest that the use of antiseizure drugs be reserved for those infants who have prolonged seizures in light of the typical self-limited nature and brief duration of the seizures, as well as the generally good outcome associated with the natural history. However, the diagnosis is not generally able to be made until after treatment is initiated, since a full evaluation for sepsis and other more common, and treatable, causes of neonatal seizures is required. If antiseizure drugs are used, and the diagnosis is clear, they can often be stopped once the infant is beyond the usual 24 to 48 hour period of recurrence risk.</p><p>Infants with this disorder are classically described to have a uniformly good outcome in terms of neurologic status, development, and post-neonatal epilepsy. However, some studies suggest a more variable outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]; one meta-analysis found abnormalities in about 15 percent of infants followed from six months to six years, most with a transient &quot;psychomotor delay&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Thus, the disorder may not always be as benign as its designation implies, suggesting that either there is an underlying etiology that has not yet been characterized, or that the seizures themselves may adversely affect the infant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Benign familial neonatal epilepsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since the first description of a family with neonatal seizures in several generations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], there has been great progress made in the characterization of the syndrome of BFNC, its genetics, and biology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This syndrome has been reported to occur in 14 per 100,000 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Benign familial neonatal epilepsy is considered to be one of several epileptic disorders characterized as a channelopathy, caused in most cases by mutations in voltage-gated potassium channel genes (<em>KCNQ2</em> and <em>KCNQ3</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]. The disorder is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. The penetrance of these mutations is approximately 85 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Fifteen percent of those who carry a mutated gene may fail to show seizures. In addition, there may be some families with undetected mutations, or with mutations in genes more commonly associated with later-onset seizures or more severe epilepsy syndromes, such as <em>SCN2A</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].

The seizures typically occur within a few days to one week of life, although there is some variability in age at onset. Seizures are usually brief and resolve spontaneously in early infancy, but may continue until age two to three months. The interictal EEG is usually normal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment and prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial evaluation and treatment for BFNC is similar to that for other neonatal seizures. A complete evaluation for acute symptomatic neonatal seizures remains necessary even when BFNE is suspected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis of neonatal seizures&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As with the more severe phenotype of <em>KCNQ2</em> encephalopathy (see <a href=\"#H1832907456\" class=\"local\">'KCNQ2 encephalopathy'</a> below), observational data suggest that seizures may respond preferentially to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">carbamazepine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxcarbazepine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">oxcarbazepine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. </p><p>The syndrome had been considered to be benign because initial reports suggested a relatively good outcome and no long term neurologic sequelae. However, subsequent studies have found a higher incidence of post neonatal epilepsy than in those without benign familial seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Seizures after age six months occur in up to one third of patients with <em>KCNQ2 </em>mutations, and those with higher neonatal seizure burden appear to be the most likely to have persistent epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">SEVERE SYNDROMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A severe neonatal epilepsy syndrome should be suspected in newborns who lack an obvious cause for acute symptomatic seizures, especially if the interictal electroencephalogram (EEG) shows a burst suppression pattern. The severe syndromes are often associated with refractory seizures and poor neurodevelopmental outcomes.</p><p>Once immediately treatable symptomatic causes of neonatal seizures are excluded, first-line diagnostic testing should include brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which may help narrow the differential diagnosis and tailor the subsequent workup. An intravenous pyridoxine challenge should be performed. Serum, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies are obtained on a case-by-case basis. Genetic testing is recommended in neonates with epilepsy who do not have an acute symptomatic cause identified on initial history, examination, and neuroimaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

Although EME and EIEE are considered distinct syndromes, they both exhibit a burst suppression pattern on EEG. In addition, there may be considerable overlap between EME and EIEE in terms of diagnostic criteria and prognosis.

The burst suppression pattern may be present only in sleep, but it can also occur in all sleep-wake stages. The bursts are typically short (one to three seconds) and the periods of suppression are relatively long (two to 10 seconds). There is sometimes no associated EEG seizure pattern when myoclonus is present, but EEG seizures are recorded when focal-clonic or tonic seizures occur.

Although the fragmentary myoclonus may eventually resolve over weeks or months, the focal motor seizures, if they do occur, tend to become refractory to antiseizure drug therapy. The infants do not develop neurologically and tend not to acquire any developmental milestones. Approximately 50 percent of affected infants die, most within the first year of life.</p><p>The encephalopathy and the associated fragmentary myoclonus are treated with etiology-specific therapies when available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE) has also been referred to as Ohtahara syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. It is a rare disorder characterized by frequent tonic spasms in neonates and infants, with burst-suppression pattern on EEG. In contrast to EME, the burst suppression pattern in EIEE is seen across all sleep-wake stages.

Genetic testing with an epilepsy gene panel or whole exome sequencing is appropriate when any of these etiologies is considered likely and no alternative etiology has been identified on initial evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures#H406587901\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis of neonatal seizures&quot;, section on 'Genetic testing'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Onset is within the first two to three months of life. At onset the neurologic examination is abnormal with developmental delay, spasticity, and often motor asymmetries. The predominant seizure type is tonic spasm, and within the spasm there is often a marked asymmetry of movement. Additional seizure types include focal motor seizures and hemiconvulsive seizures.</p><p>Tonic spasms are the predominant seizure type in EIEE; they may occur in clusters, or they may occur intermittently in some patients. Tonic spasms occur early in the course of EIEE and erratic myoclonus typically does not occur at all. However, other myoclonic seizures may rarely occur in neonates with EIEE. This contrasts with the clinical features of EME, where erratic myoclonus is a characteristic early and tonic spasms a characteristic late seizure type.</p><p>The characteristic background EEG pattern in EIEE (similar to EME) is that of burst suppression, with relatively prolonged bursts (two to six seconds) consisting of very high voltage activity (150-350uV) and relatively shorter periods of suppression (three to five seconds). This pattern is seen across all sleep-wake states. The EEG shows associated synchronization when the tonic spasms occur, with an initial high-voltage slow wave and then generalized fast activity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment and prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial approach to the treatment of EIEE is similar to that of other types of neonatal seizures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-neonatal-seizures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of neonatal seizures&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Treatment of EIEE has generally been disappointing, although as the genetic underpinnings of EIEE are increasingly understood, there is renewed interest and optimism in more tailored therapies. There have been reported trials of steroid therapy (ACTH and corticosteroids), antiseizure drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">valproate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zonisamide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">zonisamide</a>), and vitamin B6. There have also been case reports of treatment with hemispherectomy and cortical dysplasia resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>The overall outcome of EIEE is poor. Approximately 50 percent of affected patients die in infancy. Survivors have severe neurologic impairment. In most neonates, the EEG evolves to hypsarhythmia, which is typically asymmetrical. In the remainder, the EEG evolves to consist of multifocal or unifocal spikes. Rarely, the EEG evolves to a diffusely slow background.</p><p>When considering prognosis, it is worth noting that EIEE (Ohtahara syndrome) is the earliest of the age-dependent encephalopathies that include West syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. The three share the following features:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specific age of onset</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe mental retardation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abundant epileptiform EEG abnormalities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The potential to evolve sequentially from syndrome to syndrome depending upon the age of the patient</p><p/><p>Thus, as the infant with Ohtahara syndrome becomes a few months old, the patient may develop West syndrome and then in childhood develop Lennox-Gastaut syndrome with the associated seizure types and prognosis.</p><p>West syndrome (also known as infantile spasms) is discussed in detail separately.

Infants with loss of function <em>KCNQ2</em> variants present in the first week of life with an abnormal neurologic examination (encephalopathy, hypotonia, and lack of visual attentiveness) and severe, treatment-resistant seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Some affected infants can present with what appears to be Ohtahara syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Neonates with gain of function <em>KCNQ2</em> variants may have prominent nonepileptic startle-like myoclonus, in addition to encephalopathy and abnormal EEG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>The seizures often have a tonic semiology, but are not classically tonic spasms. The markedly abnormal EEG can have abundant multifocal negative sharp waves <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> can meet criteria for burst suppression. Brain MRI reveals subtle abnormalities (T1 and T2 hyperintensity) in the basal ganglia and thalami. These imaging findings may resolve after the neonatal period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Although the seizures may resolve by age three years, affected children typically have severe global neurodevelopmental disabilities.</p><p><em>KCNQ2</em> mutations may result in a dominant-negative effect on voltage-gated potassium channels, which in a xenopus model system could be partially reversed by retigabine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].
