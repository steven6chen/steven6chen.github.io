Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, although fulfilling this definition, are usually not included in the designation of AT and are typically identified as specific entities.</p><p>Atrial tachyarrhythmias are most commonly seen in children with congenital heart disease (CHD) in whom cardiac surgery has been performed; they also occur in children without cardiac surgery or CHD, and may result in significant morbidity.</p><p>ATs, including atrial flutter and fibrillation, in children not having undergone heart surgery will be reviewed here. Atrial arrhythmias in patients with CHD are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-arrhythmias-including-av-block-in-congenital-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial arrhythmias (including AV block) in congenital heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5913105\"><span class=\"h1\">NOMENCLATURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AT is a subset of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). SVT is a broad group of tachycardic disorders that includes any non-sinus rapid rhythm that arises from structures above the bundle branches, including the atrium.</p><p>AT can be divided into several different tachyarrhythmias based on the P wave phenotype on electrocardiogram (ECG), whether a single or multiple foci are involved in the origin of the tachycardia, and the frequency and duration of tachycardia (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">sporadic/paroxysmal,</span> frequently recurrent, or persistent tachycardia). The tachycardia mechanism (macroreentry, microreentry, enhanced automaticity, and triggered) only loosely correlates with this schema and should be avoided as part of the classification nomenclature unless the mechanism is clearly known. For completeness sake, atrial flutter and fibrillation are also discussed in this review.</p><p>The following classification is used in this review:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Primary atrial tachycardia</strong> &ndash; Primary atrial tachycardia, or simply atrial tachycardia, implies a non-sinus tachycardia, but having discrete and monotonous P waves. Beyond this general term, the nomenclature continues to evolve, and presently some experts use the terms atrial ectopic tachycardia (AET) and focal atrial tachycardia (FAT) interchangeably. We prefer to use these two terms as subtypes of primary atrial tachycardia along with sinoatrial node reentry tachycardia, with the intent of communicating different tachycardia characteristics.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Atrial ectopic tachycardia</strong> (AET), sometimes referred to as ectopic atrial tachycardia (EAT), emanates from a single atrial focus, is mostly incessant, and has a variable rate over time that is influenced by the autonomic nervous system. During periods of marked vagotonia, AET may be suppressed in some individuals. The P waves are discrete and non-sinus in appearance. As with all pathologic ATs, the PR interval may be inappropriately long relative to the atrial rate. This tachycardia usually occurs due to an area of enhanced automaticity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Focal atrial tachycardia</strong> (FAT), also due to a single focus, behaves in a paroxysmal manner, stopping and starting abruptly. It may be a rare sporadic event or may recur frequently, even nearly incessantly. The rate is usually relatively constant within a given paroxysm. Although the name does not imply a mechanism, microreentry or triggered activity is thought to be the most common cause. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=focal-atrial-tachycardia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Focal atrial tachycardia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Sinoatrial node reentry tachycardia</strong> (SANRT) is a form of FAT, but one which sometimes is categorized separately. Like all reentry tachycardias, it starts and stops abruptly. Its P waves are identical to sinus P waves, as it emanates from the head of the sinoatrial node. Similar to AET and other FATs, the PR interval may be longer than expected for the tachycardia rate. It may be terminated with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">adenosine</a>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sinoatrial-nodal-reentrant-tachycardia-sanrt\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sinoatrial nodal reentrant tachycardia (SANRT)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chaotic atrial tachycardia</strong> &ndash; Chaotic atrial tachycardia (CAT, which is called multifocal atrial tachycardia in adults) is diagnosed when there are at least three different rapidly depolarizing, non-sinus P wave morphologies during a 10-second rhythm strip or ECG. Classically defined, there should be irregular P-P, P-R, and R-R intervals. The degree of persistence versus intermittency of the tachycardia is not implied by the name. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multifocal-atrial-tachycardia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multifocal atrial tachycardia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Atrial flutter</strong> &ndash; Typical atrial flutter (AFL) is a macroreentry tachycardia in which the critical part of the large electrical circuit passes between the inferior vena cava and the tricuspid valve annulus, the cavotricuspid isthmus. It manifests as a sawtooth pattern on ECG, usually with 2:1 atrioventricular block. The pattern is often better observed when an intravenous bolus of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">adenosine</a> is administered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-atrial-flutter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of atrial flutter&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intraatrial reentrant tachycardia</strong> &ndash; Intraatrial reentrant tachycardia (IART) implies a macroreentry mechanism and usually follows surgery for congenital heart disease. Its appearance and behavior are akin to atrial flutter, although, by definition, the anatomical mechanism of IART is different than typical atrial flutter. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-arrhythmias-including-av-block-in-congenital-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial arrhythmias (including AV block) in congenital heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Atrial fibrillation</strong> &ndash; Atrial fibrillation (AF) involves multiple, simultaneous atrial reentry wavelets that appear on a rhythm strip as a low amplitude or choppy, irregular baseline with a variable R-R interval. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of atrial fibrillation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of and risk factors for atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Descriptors of AT, such as &quot;sporadic,&quot; &quot;frequently recurrent,&quot; &quot;non-sustained incessant,&quot; and &quot;persistent,&quot; help communicate the tachycardia behavior, but may also lead to confusion. These terms represent a continuum that describes the frequency and persistence of the arrhythmia, but the mechanism is not implied.</p><p>In some conditions, the above classification implies the underlying tachycardia mechanism (AET, SANRT, IART, AFL, AF), but not in others (FAT, CAT). Although the correlation of mechanism with rhythm strip phenotype is imperfect, there are some clinical features that are associated with specific mechanisms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-narrow-qrs-complex-tachycardias#H436425\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of narrow QRS complex tachycardias&quot;, section on 'Automaticity and triggered activity'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-narrow-qrs-complex-tachycardias#H436418\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of narrow QRS complex tachycardias&quot;, section on 'Mechanisms of reentry'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reentry always implies a sudden onset and termination of tachycardia, but not the frequency of events. For single anatomic circuit reentrant mechanisms (eg, SANRT, IART, AFL), the atrial rate is fairly constant within an episode.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enhanced automaticity occurs when a small area of atrial muscle has depolarization properties that are faster than those of the underlying or normal atrial tissue and sinoatrial node. Such a site tends to depolarize at rates that vary over time and are influenced by changes in autonomic tone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Triggered activity occurs when a site suddenly depolarizes rapidly in response to catecholamine surge and secondary intracellular calcium loading. The rate is also relatively constant. This mechanism may be very difficult to prove.</p><p/><p>The other important distinction that defines the classification of pediatric AT is whether or not the child has undergone cardiac surgery. Atrial arrhythmias associated with congenital heart disease and cardiac surgery are discussed separately.</p><p>Our approach is to use the above classification schema delineated by the rhythm strip, adding modifiers based upon the onset, frequency, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> persistence of tachycardia episodes, and if known, the underlying mechanism (eg, sporadic FAT, non-sustained incessant CAT, or persistent AET).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5913112\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although atrial arrhythmias occur most commonly following surgery for congenital heart disease, they can occur spontaneously in the fetus, child, and adolescent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5913120\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fetal arrhythmias occur in approximately one to two percent of pregnancies, of which five to eight percent are due to non-sinus tachycardia. Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is the most common non-sinus fetal tachycardia and has a heart rate that is typically between 220 and 300 bpm. By far the most common fetal SVTs are orthodromic atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia and atrial flutter. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-general-approach-to-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-fetal-arrhythmias#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the general approach to diagnosis and treatment of fetal arrhythmias&quot;, section on 'Tachyarrhythmias'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5913128\"><span class=\"h2\">Infants and children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children and infants without cardiac surgery, primary atrial tachycardia appears throughout infancy and childhood, and accounts for 14 percent of SVT cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-tachycardias-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Based on an estimated prevalence of SVT of 1 in 200 to 400 children, the prevalence of primary atrial tachycardia in children is approximately 0.03 to 0.08 percent. By comparison, the prevalence of asymptomatic ectopic atrial tachycardia in adult males applying for a pilot's license was 0.34 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-tachycardias-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-supraventricular-tachycardia-in-children#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of supraventricular tachycardia in children&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5913135\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES AND NATURAL HISTORY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5913143\"><span class=\"h2\">Frequency and duration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Signs and symptoms of ATs depend upon the duration and persistence of the tachycardia and the rate of ventricular response. The presentation is affected by the age of onset, as older verbal patients can describe palpitations, potentially leading to earlier detection, whereas infants and toddlers may present with more serious findings because of their inability to verbally describe symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5913150\"><span class=\"h3\">Sustained tachycardia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As a group, sustained ATs (&quot;persistent&quot; or &quot;non-sustained incessant,&quot; using the nomenclature above) are more likely to represent atrial ectopic tachycardia (AET), or incessant or frequently recurring focal atrial tachycardia (FAT), and, in infants, chaotic atrial tachycardia (CAT). They usually are associated with a slower ventricular rate than the more common types of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) (atrioventricular [AV] reciprocating tachycardia and AV node reentrant tachycardia [AVNRT]) and other types of AT (eg, sporadic FAT).</p><p>Affected patients may not recognize palpitations or may be unable to verbalize symptoms, and may only come to medical attention after the development of heart failure. This is called tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. Atrial ectopic tachycardia (AET) is the most common cause of tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, accounting for about 60 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-tachycardias-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These patients have impaired myocardial performance, including left ventricular dilatation, reduced shortening fraction, and load-independent measures of hypocontractility (stress-velocity index) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-tachycardias-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The chronic increased atrial rate that is likely to lead to tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy is not well defined. In our experience, some teenagers with average heart rates of 110 to 120 bpm may have normal cardiac function for up to eight years without any sign of myocardial impairment.</p><p>Clinical manifestations of tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy vary depending upon the patient's age.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the affected fetus, nonimmune hydrops fetalis is likely to develop. Ascites, pleural and pericardial effusions, and increased skin thickness can be detected on antenatal ultrasonography.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants present with nonspecific signs of heart failure including tachypnea, poor feeding, sweating, and failure to thrive. These symptoms are more common when the infants increase their exertion, such as during feeding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older children and teenagers present with complaints of palpitations (feeling the heart beat or race) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> classic symptoms of heart failure including dyspnea, fatigue with an inability to keep up with peers, respiratory distress, and diaphoresis (sweating). Symptoms are more severe and common with exertion.</p><p/><p>Clinical improvement usually occurs after ablation therapy, with normalization of left ventricular contractility and, later, reduction in left ventricular volume within 7 to 10 weeks of the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-tachycardias-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, patients may have persistent derangement in diastolic function, and cardiac interstitial fibrosis, thought to represent permanent damage, has been reported one year after resolution of the tachycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-tachycardias-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5913158\"><span class=\"h3\">Paroxysmal (sporadic) tachycardia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Paroxysmal atrial tachycardias may clinically simulate the more common forms of SVT, AV reciprocating tachycardia and AVNRT. Sporadic FAT and atrial flutter are the most common ATs to fall into this clinical category. Paroxysmal tachycardias present with sudden palpitations, shortness of breath, presyncope, dizziness, and sometimes chest pain. The preverbal child may become irritable or suddenly quiet with associated pallor, diaphoresis, and feeding intolerance.</p><p>In some patients with atrial flutter, the above symptoms may not occur because they may have such a fast atrial rate that there is 2:1 AV conduction. In these patients, atrial flutter may become persistent, and, if untreated, lead to tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. Sporadic symptoms in such a patient may represent moments of 1:1 AV conduction, but within the context of a persistent arrhythmia.</p><p>Syncope is a relatively uncommon sign of ATs, but if it occurs, especially in children who have undergone cardiac surgery, it is associated with an increased risk of sudden death.

They can occur at any age and are most commonly of idiopathic origin, although they have been reported in association with cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, respiratory infection, congenital heart disease, myocarditis, and chronic pulmonary disease, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia with pulmonary hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-tachycardias-in-children/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. However, it is unclear whether any of these conditions are risk factors for either FAT or AET.</p><p>In children without congenital heart disease, the anatomic substrate for FAT is most commonly along the crista terminalis of the right atrium, the ostium of the coronary sinus, the tricuspid or mitral valve annuli, or the atrial appendages. Foci have also been mapped to the noncoronary cusp of the aortic valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-tachycardias-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. FAT may also arise from atrial tumors, notoriously from rhabdomyomas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Affected infants and small children are generally responsive to medical therapy, and there is a reasonable likelihood of spontaneous resolution after a few months or years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-tachycardias-in-children/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. In one report of infants less than six months of age, the arrhythmia spontaneously resolved within one year in 14 of 15 patients (93 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-tachycardias-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In contrast, older children (greater than three years of age) are less likely to respond to medical therapy and have a lower resolution rate. In several case series, spontaneous remission rates vary from 34 to 75 percent for patients up to 18 years of age within 10 to 28 months of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-tachycardias-in-children/abstract/6,10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10-13</a>]. In patients with chronic or frequently recurrent conditions who are not responsive to medical therapy, ablation therapy is suggested. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=focal-atrial-tachycardia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Focal atrial tachycardia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5913182\"><span class=\"h3\">Chaotic atrial tachycardia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chaotic atrial tachycardia is also referred to as multifocal atrial tachycardia in adults. An uncommon arrhythmia in children, it usually occurs as a transient disorder during early infancy with mild ventricular dysfunction, often associated with a respiratory illness. It typically resolves completely after six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-tachycardias-in-children/abstract/7,14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,14-17</a>]. Late arrhythmias are unlikely to occur, and the prognosis for long-term outcome is excellent in children with no underlying abnormality. In some cases, chaotic atrial tachycardia is seen in patients with structural heart disease, and the outcome is dependent upon the underlying condition. Anecdotal reports suggest that this arrhythmia emanates from multiple pulmonary veins, similar to the origin of atrial fibrillation in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-tachycardias-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multifocal-atrial-tachycardia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multifocal atrial tachycardia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5913190\"><span class=\"h3\">Atrial flutter and intraatrial reentry tachycardia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atrial flutter can occur in fetuses and neonates with structurally normal hearts. Comorbid conditions are not usually present; however, cases of atrial flutter associated with neonatal Coxsackie myocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-tachycardias-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>] and following maternal treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lithium</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-tachycardias-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] have been reported. The mechanism is thought to be similar to adults, involving macroreentry around the tricuspid valve, although definitive studies have not been performed. Neonatal atrial flutter rarely reoccurs following cardioversion with or without medical treatment.</p><p>Atrial flutter is exceedingly rare in older children with structurally normal hearts, and it is primarily seen in children with a history of previous cardiac surgery, particularly following the Mustard, Senning, or Fontan procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-tachycardias-in-children/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>]. If this rhythm involves macroreentry not around the tricuspid valve, it is called intraatrial reentry tachycardia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5913198\"><span class=\"h3\">Atrial fibrillation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is uncommon in children, and most pediatric cases are associated with congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathy, or Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-tachycardias-in-children/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. There is a growing appreciation of adolescent patients who develop AF immediately following a more common SVT, so-called &quot;tachycardia-induced-tachycardia&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-tachycardias-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Also, paroxysmal AF may occur in biologically predisposed but otherwise completely healthy patients during a hypervagal event or after drinking a cold beverage. In rare cases, AF may be seen in a child with hyperthyroidism; however, in this setting, assessment should include an evaluation for a possible structural heart lesion.</p><p>There have been reported rare familial cases of AF, which have been associated with sinus node dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-tachycardias-in-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] or with fetal onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-tachycardias-in-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In three families with autosomal dominant AF, the affected gene was mapped to 10q22-q24 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-tachycardias-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. AF has also been associated with mutations in several ion channel genes including potassium (<em>KVLQT1</em>), sodium (<em>SCN5A</em>), and ryanodine2 receptor (<em>RyR2</em>) channels.
