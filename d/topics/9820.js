These patches can be thick. They usually develop slowly over time.</p><p>Leukoplakia usually happens when something irritates the inside of the mouth, such as poorly fitting dentures or a rough spot on a tooth. Smoking and chewing tobacco are also common causes of leukoplakia. Leukoplakia can sometimes turn into mouth cancer after a few years, but this is uncommon.</p><p>A type of leukoplakia called &quot;oral hairy leukoplakia&quot; sometimes happens in people with HIV infection. This type of leukoplakia is caused by a virus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H115678953\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you have white or gray patches on your tongue or in your mouth that don't go away, see your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H115678968\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. The doctor or nurse will talk with you and do an exam. He or she might also do a test called a &quot;biopsy.&quot; For this test, the doctor will take a small sample of the gray or white patch. Then another doctor will look at the sample under a microscope.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H115678983\"><span class=\"h1\">How is leukoplakia treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main treatment for leukoplakia is to avoid the things that cause it. If you smoke or use chewing tobacco, quit! If you have poorly fitting dentures or a rough place on a tooth that is rubbing against your cheek, ask your dentist to fix the problem.</p><p>Many people don't need any other treatment for leukoplakia. But if your doctor or nurse thinks it might turn into mouth cancer, he or she might recommend surgery to remove the leukoplakia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H115678998\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mouth-sores-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Mouth sores (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
