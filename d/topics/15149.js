More often, right ventricular MI (RVMI) is associated with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction of the inferior wall of the left ventricle, and occurs in 30 to 50 percent of such cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/right-ventricular-myocardial-infarction/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>]. </p><p>RVMI is associated with higher in-hospital morbidity and mortality compared with patients with a similar infarction territory in the left ventricle but that does not involve the right ventricle. Poor outcome is usually related to profound hemodynamic and electrical complications, which occur in approximately 50 percent of affected individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/right-ventricular-myocardial-infarction/abstract/1-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-9</a>].

This is in marked contrast to the effects of ischemia and reperfusion on the left ventricle in which prolonged ischemia often leads to infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/right-ventricular-myocardial-infarction/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. The following observations support ischemia, rather than infarction, as the mechanism by which adverse outcomes are precipitated:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Right ventricular function improves in the majority of patients with right ventricular infarction, including those who are not reperfused [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/right-ventricular-myocardial-infarction/abstract/7,8,12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,12-14</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Long-term prognosis'</a> below.) There are several factors that make the right ventricle less susceptible to infarction:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Compared to the left ventricle, oxygen demand is significantly lower in the right ventricle because of its much smaller muscle mass and lower afterload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/right-ventricular-myocardial-infarction/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Coronary perfusion in the right ventricle occurs in both systole and diastole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/right-ventricular-myocardial-infarction/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>There is more extensive collateral flow from left to right coronary arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/right-ventricular-myocardial-infarction/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The right ventricle may also be protected from infarction to a greater degree than the left ventricle by ischemic preconditioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/right-ventricular-myocardial-infarction/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Thus, the majority of RV infarcts result from occlusion of the right coronary artery proximal to the origin of the major RV branches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/right-ventricular-myocardial-infarction/abstract/1-3,5,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,5,20,21</a>]. </p><p>However, in patients with a left dominant system, which occurs in about 15 percent of the general population (or those with a chronically occluded proximal right coronary artery and significant collateral blood flow from either the left anterior descending or circumflex coronary artery), more than 50 percent of the right ventricle can be supplied by the left coronary circulation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34542612\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemodynamic consequences</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hemodynamic consequences of RVMI depend on the extent of RV free wall dysfunction; the presence of concomitant right atrial ischemia (resulting from very proximal occlusions), which leads to underfilling of the RV; and the extent of simultaneous left ventricular impairment. Clinically evident hemodynamic manifestations are seen in less than 50 percent of affected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/right-ventricular-myocardial-infarction/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. It should be kept in mind that in patients with RVMI, hemodynamic compromise may be due to RV dysfunction, left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, or a combination of these. In some cases, the relative contribution of the right and left ventricles may be uncertain and hemodynamic monitoring may be required both to understand the pathophysiology and to guide treatment. (See <a href=\"#H3300080\" class=\"local\">'Hemodynamic monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p>Proximal occlusion of the right coronary artery compromises RV free wall perfusion, leading to dyskinesis and depressed global RV performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/right-ventricular-myocardial-infarction/abstract/2,6,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,19,20</a>]. This leads to a fall in the delivery of blood to the left ventricle and decreased systemic cardiac output despite intact LV systolic performance. RV (and LV) diastolic dysfunction also contributes to hemodynamic compromise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/right-ventricular-myocardial-infarction/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The ischemic RV is stiff and dilated late in diastole, impeding inflow from the right atrium and leading to rapid diastolic pressure elevation. RV dilatation and elevated diastolic pressure shift the interventricular septum toward the volume deprived LV, further impairing LV compliance and filling. Abrupt RV dilatation within the non-compliant pericardium elevates intrapericardial pressure, the resultant constraint further intensifying septal-mediated diastolic ventricular interactions and thereby impairing both RV and LV compliance and filling. </p><p>Other factors that may worsen the hemodynamic profile of patients with RVMI include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Right atrial ischemia can impair right atrial function, worsening the hemodynamic changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/right-ventricular-myocardial-infarction/abstract/21,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,24</a>].This occurs when the culprit right coronary artery lesion is proximal to the right atrial branches.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depression of LV function (for example, from prior MI) may exacerbate hemodynamic compromise for any degree of ischemic RV dysfunction. This effect is attributable not only due to loss of LV power, but also due to the fact that under conditions of severely depressed RV free wall contraction, RV performance is dependent on LV-septal contraction, which is generally abnormal with prior LV systolic dysfunction. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tricuspid valve regurgitation, caused by ischemia to the papillary muscle or by dilatation of the tricuspid annulus. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mechanical complications of MI, such as ventricular septal rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/right-ventricular-myocardial-infarction/abstract/2,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,25</a>].

Patients with acute RVMI are at increased risk for both high-grade atrioventricular block and bradycardia-hypotension without AV block compared to those with inferior MI alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/right-ventricular-myocardial-infarction/abstract/2,9,26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9,26-28</a>].

The right-sided ST elevation is often transient. &#160;</p><p>The extent to which RVMI impacts the clinical presentation depends on its size and the relative degree of left ventricular dysfunction. A small RVMI may not lead to hypotension or elevated jugular venous pressure. For these smaller RVMIs, making the diagnosis is less important (than in patients with larger RVMIs), as standard care for (left ventricular) MI will lead to optimal patient care.

As patients with other diagnoses, such as pericarditis with pericardial tamponade, may present with a similar picture, the diagnosis is usually secured when echocardiography shows RV cavity dilatation and impaired RV free wall motion. Additional testing is rarely needed for diagnostic purposes, but may be helpful for assessment of therapy.

Contrast-enhanced cardiovascular magnetic resonance is more sensitive for the detection of right ventricular involvement than physical examination, electrocardiography, and echocardiography in patients with an inferior MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/right-ventricular-myocardial-infarction/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Magnetic resonance imaging evidence of substantial RV injury (a significant percent of the RV manifesting microvascular obstruction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> delayed contrast enhancement) may predict adverse outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/right-ventricular-myocardial-infarction/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. However, at the present time, we do not recommend its use, as there is not yet sufficient evidence to support its use, as it has not been shown to improve patient care in this setting.

As discussed above, all patients with suspected acute RVMI and significant hemodynamic compromise should undergo urgent echo, which will typically distinguish among these diagnoses.</p><p>Of these, PE and RVMI are most often confused. Both can present with chest pain and findings of clear lung fields and hypotension (including shock) on examination. The nature of the chest pain (ischemic versus pleuritic) may be helpful in making a distinction. The electrocardiogram is usually sufficient to discriminate between the two: ST elevation in the inferior leads is rarely present in patients with PE. Elevation of serum troponin may be present with either diagnosis.</p><p>On echocardiography, right ventricular systolic dysfunction may be seen with both diagnoses. Sparing of the right ventricular apex (&quot;McConnell's sign&quot;) has been suggested to be specific for a large PE in some reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/right-ventricular-myocardial-infarction/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>], but not others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/right-ventricular-myocardial-infarction/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. We do not consider this finding specific for PE.

This includes the early use of dual oral antiplatelet (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> plus a platelet P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor blocker), statin therapy, and an anticoagulant. However, medications to improve chest pain such as opioids, nitrates, and beta blockers should be used with caution due to their potential to negatively impact preload (opioids and nitrates) or heart rate and contractility (beta blockers and calcium channel blockers).

Thus, the approach to treatment of abnormal hemodynamics may differ according to the relative contributions. Optimal management requires information obtained from a two-dimensional echocardiogram; some patients will need hemodynamic monitoring.

This is achieved by optimizing right ventricular preload and afterload. In patients who do not respond to these interventions, inotropic support may be necessary to improve right ventricular contractility. In addition, optimization of right ventricular output may require reversing bradycardia or atrioventricular dyssynchrony with appropriate pacing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Optimization of right ventricular preload</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intravenous fluid (usually isotonic saline) should be given to patients with evidence of low cardiac output (hypotension, hypoperfusion, and a low or normal jugular venous [JVP] pressure) who do not have pulmonary congestion or evidence of right heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/right-ventricular-myocardial-infarction/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

The reported efficacy of this approach is variable, a probable reflection of differences in initial volume status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/right-ventricular-myocardial-infarction/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>In most cases, a carefully monitored volume challenge is initiated by infusing aliquots of 200 to 300 mL of normal saline while serially assessing the JVP and blood pressure. An invasive catheter can also be employed, but such instrumentation should not delay emergency revascularization of the infarct-related artery. Once rapid volume infusion results in increases in JVP (or, invasively, the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure) to approximately 15 mmHg without corresponding increases in aortic pressure, further volume expansion is not likely to improve hemodynamics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/right-ventricular-myocardial-infarction/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>Nitrates, which are often used to relieve angina, and diuretics, which are given to patients with evidence of pulmonary congestion should be avoided, as they both reduce RV preload. Similarly, opioid drugs may lower preload. An increase in vagal tone caused by insertion of a bladder catheter can acutely decrease preload and lead to cardiogenic shock.</p><p>While awaiting the potential benefits of volume loading (or if fluids alone are not sufficient), severe hypotension must be stabilized through administration of inotropic therapy and vasopressors.

(See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Optimization of right ventricular preload'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with persistent hypotension after an attempt to optimize RV preload with normal saline boluses, we suggest adding <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The usual starting dose is 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> per minute. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Inotropic drugs'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with predominant RVMI do not benefit from afterload reducing therapy with either an intraaortic balloon pump or vasodilating agents. However, some patients have increased RV afterload due to left ventricular dysfunction and their hemodynamic profile is determined by biventricular dysfunction. In this setting, the use of an intraaortic balloon pump or, in uncommon cases vasodilating agents, may improve the hemodynamic profile. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Optimization of right ventricular afterload'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>As bradycardia and atrioventricular dyssynchrony can rapidly worsen the hemodynamic status of patients with a right ventricular MI, attempts to correct these electrical abnormalities should be instituted early. The indications for the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a> and temporary transvenous pacing are similar to those for the broad population of patients with MI.
