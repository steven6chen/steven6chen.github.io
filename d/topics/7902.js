Although generalized growth is stimulated, it is not evenly distributed among the protein, lipid, and carbohydrate compartments. Body protein content increases, total body fat content falls, and an increase in plasma and liver lipid content occurs because of mobilization of free fatty acids (FFA) from peripheral fat stores. The ability of insulin to promote fatty acid synthesis is antagonized by growth hormone.</p><p>Most children who were born small for gestational age (SGA) have adequate catch-up growth without pharmacologic intervention. However, for a minority, growth hormone therapy can augment growth parameters.</p><p>The indications for and efficacy of exogenous growth hormone treatment in children who were born SGA are reviewed here. The causes of and diagnostic approach to the child with short stature are discussed separately.

This means that 2.3 percent of human infants are born SGA, by definition. Most, but not all, SGA infants (either term or premature) have sufficient postnatal catch-up growth to normalize their stature by two years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Approximately 90 percent of term SGA infants display sufficient catch-up growth to attain a height above -2 SD by the age of 2 years, whereas 10 percent remain short throughout childhood and adolescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infants-with-fetal-intrauterine-growth-restriction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infants with fetal (intrauterine) growth restriction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Catch-up growth may be delayed in infants who are born preterm in addition to SGA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. These infants tend to have more severe growth restriction and are less likely to reach heights in the normal range by age 2 years, but catch-up growth may continue into mid- or late-childhood.</p><p>Pubertal timing contributes to the association between SGA and short adult stature in some cases. In one study, girls born SGA were five months younger at pubertal onset and menarche as compared to girls with normal birth weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], and earlier puberty tends to lead to reduced adult height. This effect is particularly pronounced in girls who undergo postnatal catch-up growth in addition to being born SGA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. It remains unclear whether pharmacologic suppression of puberty enhances the effects of GH treatment, as discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Dosing and administration'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal GH physiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Growth-restricted fetuses tend to hypersecrete growth hormone (GH). This may be the direct or indirect result of reduced negative feedback exerted by IGF-I that circulates in lower concentrations in growth-restricted fetuses. The endocrine milieu of the human fetus with growth restriction is characterized not only by low circulating insulin, IGF-I, IGF-II, and IGFBP-3, but also by elevated IGFBP-1 and GH levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>Hyperresponsiveness to GH-releasing factor also has been described in SGA infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This may reflect either deficient negative regulation or diminished feedback, as occurs in GH-resistant states such as undernutrition.</p><p>Intense activity of the somatotropic axis is thought to be one of the mechanisms driving the postnatal catch-up growth that occurs in the majority of SGA infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The role of the GH-IGF-I axis in postnatal growth in children born SGA is unclear. One study suggests the presence of GH resistance with high levels of circulating GH and low levels of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A separate report noted high circulating IGF-I levels consistent with IGF-I resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">SGA children without catch-up growth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 10 percent of children born SGA will remain short at 2 years of age (height &lt;-2 SD, which corresponds to height less than the second percentile for age and gender). The mechanism underlying postnatal growth failure in these children is poorly understood. An irreversible deficit in cell number, inadequate calorie intake during the first years of life, and abnormalities in GH secretion have been hypothesized. Classic GH deficiency rarely is found in these children, however there may be subtle abnormalities in the GH secretory pattern similar to those documented in adults during prolonged critical illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Regardless of the mechanism, it appears that the abnormal environmental conditions causing intrauterine growth restriction also can have long-lasting effects on growth and metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. This altered programming may either alter the tempo of development or permanently reset homeostatic control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infants-with-fetal-intrauterine-growth-restriction#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infants with fetal (intrauterine) growth restriction&quot;, section on 'Adult chronic disorders'</a>.)</p><p>In short SGA children, IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels are low-normal for chronological age, increase with high-dose GH therapy (77 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> per day), and decrease with the discontinuation of GH therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>For SGA children without catch-up growth, the differential diagnosis includes Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS). SRS is a genetically heterogeneous syndrome characterized by intrauterine growth retardation leading to small size at birth, feeding difficulties during infancy and early childhood, severe short stature, body asymmetry, triangular face with prominent forehead, and several other minor anomalies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. A clinical scoring system helps to identify the subset of children born SGA who have SRS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. SRS patients without GH treatment attain a mean adult height of adult height of -4.2 to -2.9 SD, causing a significant handicap in adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-short-stature#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of short stature&quot;, section on 'Silver-Russell syndrome'</a>.) &#160; </p><p>Other considerations include early intrauterine infections such as cytomegalovirus, rubella or toxoplasmosis, chromosomal abnormalities, and maternal substance abuse (including fetal alcohol syndrome).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">GROWTH HORMONE TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GH treatment is a recognized therapy for children who are born SGA but who fail to have catch-up growth (&quot;short SGA children&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The effective doses of GH are higher than those for children with growth hormone deficiency, suggesting relative GH <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> IGF-I resistance. &#160; &#160;</p><p>The efficacy of GH treatment for short SGA children has been demonstrated in randomized, controlled, multicenter clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Some short SGA children also may have GH deficiency or Turner syndrome, but these associated diagnoses are not required for GH treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, growth hormone is approved for use in short SGA children whose height remains less than 2 standard deviations (SD) below the mean for age and sex at 2 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In Europe, the approved indication is for short SGA children whose height is less than 2.5 SD below the mean for age and sex at 4 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. In addition, the European indications include low height velocity (ie, height velocity less than average for age) and predicted height (&gt;1 SD below mid-parental height). &#160;</p><p>In deciding whether to treat a short SGA child with growth hormone, one should consider the expected growth response and its potential benefits to the child, as compared with the risks and psychosocial burden of prolonged treatment on the child and family. The overall high cost of sustained treatment is also a reasonable consideration if the expected benefits are modest.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Growth response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The magnitude of the growth response to treatment depends on the GH dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], the age of the child (younger children are more responsive), and the family-corrected individual height deficit (children with a greater height deficit are more responsive) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. A mathematical model has been developed to help predict the response to growth hormone treatment in these children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>There are few long-term follow-up studies of children with assessment of adult height for children born SGA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/25,33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,33-35</a>]. The information from these studies is limited because of variability in dose, duration of treatment, and the age that therapy was initiated. Nonetheless, an analysis of initial adult-height outcomes from three randomized controlled trials revealed significant effects of GH treatment on adult height [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. When GH treatment was initiated by 8 years of age and continued for at least seven years, there was a treatment-induced increase in adult height of approximately 1 SD (approximately 6 cm). There were only modest advantages of a higher-dose regimen as compared with a lower-dose regimen (67 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/day</span> versus 33 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/day);</span> higher doses yield greater short-term growth responses, but confer only modest advantages on long-term height outcomes. Children who are shorter at the start of GH therapy appear to benefit the most from the higher-dose regimen. Although early initiation of GH is optimal, one study suggests that later initiation of GH also has some benefit on linear growth. Among children who started GH at a median age of 11.2 years, the median height increase improved from -2.9 SD at the start of GH treatment to -1.7 SD after reaching adult height [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Subsequent larger series confirm and extend these earlier reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Children with Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) also respond to GH therapy, but their adult height outcomes are somewhat less than for children born SGA but without SRS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-short-stature#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of short stature&quot;, section on 'Silver-Russell syndrome'</a>.) </p><p>All short SGA children may benefit from GH therapy, whether or not they have GH deficiency. In a study of treatment with GH (3 or 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/m<sup>2</sup></span> per day [about 33 or 67 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/kg/day]</span> for an average of 7.8 years) in 54 short SGA children with or without GH deficiency, height was normalized in childhood followed by growth along the target height percentile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The response to GH was independent of baseline endogenous GH secretion. The degree of response to GH therapy in SGA children without GH deficiency may have genetic determinants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Growth hormone treatment may be less effective for short SGA children than for short children with normal birth weights. In the KIGS database (Kabi International Growth Study, now maintained by Pfizer, Inc.), which contains information on a large cohort of children receiving GH treatment, the height gain during two years of treatment with GH was nearly 20 percent greater in children with normal birth weights than in those who had been SGA at birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The safety profile for GH treatment was similar among the two groups. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of growth hormone deficiency in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Dosing and administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal dose and duration of GH therapy have not been established, but the recommended dose range is 35 to 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/day</span>. In our practice, we begin GH treatment with approximately 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/day</span> based on ideal body weight, which is similar to the dose used for treatment of GH deficiency in children. </p><p>During GH therapy, we readjust doses to maintain IGF-I levels in the upper half of the normal range (ie, 0 to +2 SD) for age <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> Tanner stage of development. The GH dose should be lowered if serum IGF-I levels rise above the normal range, as recommended in guidelines from the Pediatric Endocrine Society (PES) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. This helps to avoid very high IGF-I levels, which are thought to be associated with some of the drug's toxicity. This strategy of IGF-I-based dosing has not been studied in children born SGA, but is extrapolated from the approach that we use for children with GH deficiency, in whom it has been studied, but is not an established practice. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children#H562846\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of growth hormone deficiency in children&quot;, section on 'Dose adjustment based on IGF-I response'</a>.) &#160; &#160; &#160;</p><p>Children should be monitored for evidence of complications of the treatment. Treatment is continued as long as the child is experiencing an accelerated growth rate compared with baseline, or until the growth rate slows to less than 2 to 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year</span> in late puberty. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of growth hormone deficiency in children&quot;, section on 'Growth hormone treatment'</a> and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> below.) &#160;</p><p>A number of studies have evaluated different approaches to therapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dose effect &ndash; One study from Japan compared the effect of two doses of GH in short children born SGA, who were treated with either 33 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/day</span> or 67 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The higher dose provided some advantage in height gain after five years of therapy, but also a more rapid advancement of bone age, so the long-term effect of the higher dose on height are unclear. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continuous versus discontinuous treatment &ndash; In a trial of growth hormone treatment of short SGA children, 59 children between 2 and 5 years of age were randomly assigned to one of two treatment regimens: four years of alternating treatment and observation (TOTO), or two years treatment followed by two years observation (TTOO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Height velocity and total height gain did not differ between the two groups, suggesting that interruption of treatment had no advantage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concomitant suppression of puberty &ndash; In children who are SGA, the onset of puberty may occur early [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/9,10,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,43</a>]. Because earlier onset of puberty tends to lead to reduced adult height, these observations have led to attempts to suppress puberty during GH treatment. In a randomized trial in 32 children born SGA, combination treatment with GH and a gonadotropin hormone releasing agonist (GnRHa), there was a considerable gain in predicted adult height (8 to 10 cm) during the three years of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>], but the effect on adult height was modest (mean gain of 4.9 cm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Similarly, reports from observational studies of children treated with GH suggest that adding GnRHa to the GH treatment regimen provides minimal benefit or even reduces growth outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. Although the latter studies are limited by lack of a randomized control group, these combination regimens cannot be generally recommended at present. To determine whether combined therapy is efficacious, larger randomized trials are needed, including a significant number of SGA children treated to near-adult height [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/1,37,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,37,48</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Safety</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The safety of GH therapy depends upon the modality of treatment and the individual risk factors.

Because growth hormone treatment also has been associated with increased insulin levels and insulin resistance, concerns have been raised that this population might have additive risks for insulin resistance during growth hormone treatment.</p><p>Several trials and postmarketing studies have addressed this issue.

Of note, 28 percent of children in this study were growth hormone deficient in addition to being born SGA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Long-term effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many studies have noted an association between intrauterine growth restriction and long-term health risks, including type 2 diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease. However, the mechanisms underlying this association have not been established. It is still unclear whether growth hormone treatment exacerbates or improves these long-term risks.</p><p>Some studies showed no difference in measures of insulin resistance in young adults who had been treated with GH during childhood as compared with untreated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Cardiovascular risk factors, consisting of blood pressure and total cholesterol, were improved in the treated patients. These findings suggest that growth hormone treatment is neutral or advantageous to these long-term risks. However, the findings are preliminary and reflect relatively short follow-up. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infants-with-fetal-intrauterine-growth-restriction#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infants with fetal (intrauterine) growth restriction&quot;, section on 'Outcomes'</a>.) &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GH therapy should be initiated and monitored by a pediatric endocrinologist. Before GH therapy is initiated, the child's blood pressure; IGF-I; IGFBP-3; and fasting lipids, insulin, and glucose should be measured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. During GH therapy growth parameters, blood pressure and IGF-I should be monitored. In our practice, we also monitor fasting insulin and glucose and serum lipids during GH therapy, based on the concern that GH tends to increase insulin resistance, although clinically significant increases in insulin resistance appear to be rare, as described in the section above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/7,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,27</a>].

Increases in short-term linear growth rates and in adult height have been shown in a variety of studies, but the treatment effect is highly variable and the potential advantages and disadvantages of treatment should be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest treatment with growth hormone in children who were SGA at birth and who have not had adequate catch-up growth (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). This suggestion assumes that the family has realistic understanding of the expected growth response and decides that this potential benefit outweighs the cost and burden of long-term treatment. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The definition of adequate catch-up growth varies. In the United States, growth hormone is approved for use in short SGA children whose height remains less than 2 SD below the mean for age and sex at two years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In Europe, the approved indication is for short SGA children whose height is less than 2.5 SD below the mean for age and sex at four years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-for-children-born-small-for-gestational-age/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Growth hormone treatment is likely to yield only modest gains in height compared with no treatment (an increase in adult height of approximately 6 cm, provided the treatment is begun early and continued for at least seven years). Adult height will usually be below average despite therapy. When treatment is contemplated, it is critical for the provider to discuss realistic expectations with the patient and family. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Growth response'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If treatment is chosen, we suggest beginning with doses similar to those used for treatment of growth hormone deficiency in children, approximately 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/day</span> based on ideal body weight. During growth hormone therapy, we readjust the growth hormone dose to maintain IGF-I levels in the upper half of the normal range (ie, 0 to +2 SD). Children should be monitored for evidence of complications of the treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of growth hormone deficiency in children&quot;, section on 'Growth hormone treatment'</a> and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Dosing and administration'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Growth hormone treatment yields the greatest increases in height when treatment is initiated by mid-childhood and continued for more than seven years. Children who are younger or shorter at the beginning of therapy have the greatest response as compared with untreated children. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Growth response'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Short children born SGA are at increased risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease when compared to children with normal birth weight. Whether treatment with growth hormone either improves or exacerbates these long-term risks has not been established. However, there appear to be no differences in the short-term risks of GH treatment in this population as compared with other children treated with growth hormone.
