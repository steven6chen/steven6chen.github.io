Most spiders' fangs are not strong enough to poke through your skin. Also, spiders do not usually bite unless they are crushed between you and another object.</p><p>Most people who think a spider bit them were usually bitten by a different insect, such as a tick. Also, some skin infections can look like a spider bite.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102927746\"><span class=\"h1\">How dangerous are spider bites?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most spider bites are harmless. The poison that most spiders inject when they bite (called &quot;venom&quot;) is not toxic to people. But a few types of spiders can give painful bites. In rare cases, the bites get infected or cause other serious symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F86257\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86257 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Some types of dangerous spiders live only in Australia or South America. But some are found in countries all over the world, including the United States (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F86258\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86258 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102927763\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a spider bite?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms include a small, red, raised bump on the skin. The bite might itch or burn.</p><p>Some bites do not start to hurt until a few hours after the bite. The pain can range from a slight prickly feeling to very bad pain.</p><p>In rare cases, spider bites can cause:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Redness, swelling, and pus</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flu-like symptoms such as feeling tired and sick to your stomach, throwing up, and fever</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sweating</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Very bad muscle pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Very bad belly pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dead tissue &ndash; When this happens, the center of the red bump turns a dark red, blue, or black, dries out, and forms a sore. This is called &quot;necrosis&quot; and can happen several days after a spider bite. The sore is usually about the size of a quarter but can grow larger. Most heal after a few weeks but some last for months.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102927780\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I do if a spider bites me?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you are bitten by a spider, you should:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash the area that was bitten with soap and water.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put a cold gel pack, bag of ice, or bag of frozen vegetables on the painful area every 1 to 2 hours, for 15 minutes each time. Put a thin towel between the ice (or other cold object) and your skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you can, keep the bitten area raised up above the level of your heart.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Try to figure out what type of spider bit you.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102927795\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or a nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See a doctor or nurse if you get any of the rare symptoms listed above.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102927812\"><span class=\"h1\">How are spider bites treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment involves cleaning the area well and offering different medicines, depending on what symptoms a person has. Treatments can include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicine for pain, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to treat muscle spasms, called benzodiazepines</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A tetanus shot &ndash; Tetanus is a serious infection that causes muscle spasms and stiffness. It is caused by bacteria that can get in your body through a cut, scrape, or bite.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics &ndash; If there are signs of infection (such as a fever, red skin, or pus coming from the bite), a doctor will prescribe antibiotics. But most spider bites do not get infected.</p><p/><p>People who have dead tissue because of a bite sometimes need surgery to remove the dead tissue.</p><p>People who are bitten by a widow spider and have severe pain and muscle spasms that don't get better with other treatments sometimes get a special medicine called &quot;antivenom.&quot; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102927829\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to reduce the chances of getting a spider bite?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To avoid a spider bite, be extra careful in places that dangerous spiders live (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F86258\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86258 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102927846\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=insect-bites-and-stings-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Insect bites and stings (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bee-and-insect-stings-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Bee and insect stings (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=imported-fire-ants-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Imported fire ants (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
