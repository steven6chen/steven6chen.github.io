In the United States during 2013, 760 simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK), 127 pancreas transplantation alone (PTA), and 107 pancreas after kidney (PAK) transplants were performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-selection-for-and-immunologic-issues-relating-to-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>While SPK most often employs grafts procured from a single deceased donor after brain death, some are simultaneous living-donor kidney and deceased-donor pancreas, and a few SPK (2.6 percent) are from a deceased donor after cardiac death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-selection-for-and-immunologic-issues-relating-to-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>PAK typically involves transplantation of a deceased-donor pancreas graft into a recipient with a functioning living- or deceased-donor kidney allograft. Some patients without substantial renal disease may be candidates for PTA.</p><p>The vast majority of pancreas-kidney transplants are in patients with type 1 diabetes, although a small number are in patients with type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-selection-for-and-immunologic-issues-relating-to-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. According to a report of the Organ Procurement and Transplant <span class=\"nowrap\">Network/United</span> Network for Organ Sharing <span class=\"nowrap\">(OPTN/UNOS),</span> 9.7 percent of 760 pancreas-kidney transplants and 5.6 percent of 107 PAK transplants performed in 2013 were in patients with type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-selection-for-and-immunologic-issues-relating-to-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SELECTION OF OPTIMAL PROCEDURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The selection of the optimal procedure for individual patients depends on patient-specific factors and organ availability. For younger patients (ie, &lt;45 years) with type 1 diabetes who have no other cardiac risk factors and few other comorbidities, simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) provides the best survival compared with dialysis and compared with deceased-donor kidney transplantation alone (KTA). The achievement of near normoglycemia and insulin independence may improve the quality of life and may prevent progression of and improve diabetic microvascular and macrovascular complications, although adequate data to support the latter benefit is not available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-selection-for-and-immunologic-issues-relating-to-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-and-complications-associated-with-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus#H100158167\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits and complications associated with kidney-pancreas transplantation in diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Patient survival'</a>.)</p><p>However, the wait times for a SPK can be two to five years. The one- and five-year mortality for waitlisted SPK candidates has been reported as 6.6 and 54 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-selection-for-and-immunologic-issues-relating-to-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], and many waitlisted candidates die without ever being transplanted. If facing a long wait for SPK organs and a suitable living donor is available, we generally prefer a living-donor KTA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-and-complications-associated-with-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus#H100158167\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits and complications associated with kidney-pancreas transplantation in diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Patient survival'</a>.)</p><p>After a kidney is transplanted, the wait for a pancreas alone is weeks to months and nearly always less than a year. Thus, patients with a similar clinical profile who have the option to receive a living-donor kidney allograft may do well to choose pancreas after kidney (PAK) transplant, provided they are willing to undergo a separate operation. If the recipient, on the other hand, is not on dialysis or in a region that has a short waiting time, waiting for SPK transplant is reasonable.</p><p>In our opinion, for patients who have available a living kidney donor, the decision to wait on the deceased-donor waitlist in order to get a SPK transplant depends on the dialysis vintage, the average waiting time on the list for SPK, tolerance of dialysis while on the waiting list, and the availability of a good-match living donor (two haplotype or zero mismatch).</p><p>For suitable candidates who are not on dialysis (or just started dialysis) and anticipate a short waiting time for SPK (ie, &lt;2 years), we suggest an SPK rather than living-donor kidney transplant.</p><p>However, we suggest that suitable candidates who have already been on dialysis for a year or two and are anticipating a waiting time for SPK of two years or more proceed with living-donor KTA if one is available. Patients with diabetes and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis have high mortality on the waiting list.</p><p>For patients who have a well-functioning transplanted kidney, the decision to undergo pancreas transplantation after the kidney transplantation (PAK) depends upon patient lifestyle and satisfaction of living KTA, willingness to go through another procedure, and diabetes control.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H74518619\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Suitability for kidney-pancreas transplantation is dependent upon patient-specific factors, including age and comorbidities. In order to be listed for a simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK), the candidate must meet certain requirements based on glomerular filtration rate (GFR), insulin requirement, C-peptide levels, and body mass index (BMI). Many of these requirements are mandated by the national pancreas allocation system implemented in 2014.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Age -</strong> Appropriate candidates for SPK are generally younger than kidney transplantation alone (KTA) candidates, reflecting several factors. Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD) at an earlier age than patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Additionally, longstanding diabetes contributes to a higher incidence of other complications, such as cardiovascular disease, which affects transplant candidacy. Single-center studies have reported similar patient and pancreas allograft survival in patients older than 50 years compared with younger recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-selection-for-and-immunologic-issues-relating-to-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. However, both reporting and selection bias may impact data from smaller studies. An analysis of the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database including 20,854 pancreas transplant recipients between 1996 and 2012 demonstrated that graft survival was superior in recipients 40 to 49 years of age, with reduced patient survival in those 50 to 59 years of age and poor graft and patient survival in those &gt;60 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-selection-for-and-immunologic-issues-relating-to-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Age cut-off for pancreas transplant varies by center within the US, between 45 and 65 years old. We believe that select patients between ages 50 to 60 years may benefit from SPK if they do not have significant comorbidities such as advanced cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, or peripheral vascular disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>GFR -</strong> The national pancreas allocation system will require SPK candidates to meet criteria for kidney transplant listing (GFR &le;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> <strong>OR</strong> dialysis dependence).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Insulin requirement -</strong> The insulin requirement and serum C-peptide levels are assessed in order to determine whether the patient will benefit from pancreas transplantation. Since pancreas transplantation restores insulin production, patients who are insulinopenic and who have undetectable or very low C-peptide levels are most likely to benefit from the procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the national pancreas allocation system that was implemented in October 2014, candidates have to meet the following criteria for pancreas listing:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>On insulin <strong>AND</strong> C-peptide &le;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> <strong>OR</strong></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>On insulin <strong>AND</strong> C-peptide &gt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> <strong>AND</strong> BMI &le;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><br/>In general, patients with insulin requirements exceeding 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/kg/day</span> may not achieve euglycemia after pancreas transplant. In our practice, a very high insulin requirement suggests that the patient may have insulin resistance or <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-insulin/islet</span> cell antibodies; such patients may be less likely to benefit from pancreas transplant, although no studies have examined this issue.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients who are on peritoneal dialysis may have large insulin requirements due to the use of dextrose-containing dialysate; this must be taken into consideration when such patients are assessed for transplantation since the insulin requirement will likely decrease when peritoneal dialysis is discontinued following transplantation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Complications of insulin therapy, including the presence of hypoglycemic unawareness and <span class=\"nowrap\">frequency/severity</span> of hypoglycemia episodes, may increase the urgency for pancreas transplant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>BMI -</strong> The maximum allowable BMI for pancreas or combined kidney-pancreas transplant varies between centers but is often lower than that for KTA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-selection-for-and-immunologic-issues-relating-to-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. This is because, unlike kidney transplantation, pancreas transplantation requires intra-abdominal surgery, and post-transplantation wound healing is affected to a greater extent by an elevated BMI. Our BMI cut-off for SPK is 30, whereas the cut-off for kidney is 36 in some centers and 40 in others.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Furthermore, an elevated BMI is associated with insulin resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-selection-for-and-immunologic-issues-relating-to-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] and, in a single-center, retrospective series, was associated with posttransplant diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-selection-for-and-immunologic-issues-relating-to-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p>In addition to age, duration of diabetes and insulin use, C-peptide levels (as a marker of endogenous insulin secretion), daily insulin requirements, and BMI, potential recipients should be screened for tobacco and other substance use, functional capacity, presence and severity of diabetic-related complications, and additional comorbidities. The evaluation for comorbidities is discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H74518868\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Potential recipients are carefully screened for coronary disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and active infections.

Coronary heart disease, defined by prior myocardial infarction, coronary bypass, or percutaneous coronary angioplasty, is associated (independent of age) with a 20 percent one-year mortality in simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) and pancreas after kidney (PAK) recipients, four times greater than in diabetic recipients without a history of myocardial infarction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-selection-for-and-immunologic-issues-relating-to-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Among such patients, traditional cardiovascular risk factors include a long duration of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, tobacco use, age, and sex. Nontraditional risk factors include long dialysis vintage, proteinuria, and hyperparathyroidism.

Additionally, the evaluation may identify patients who have limited expected survival due to severe cardiac disease; such patients should not undergo transplantation.</p><p>The optimal approach to screening the potential pancreas transplant recipient is not clear, and there are no reliable comparative studies in this cohort to guide the evaluation. We screen with either noninvasive tests or cardiac catheterization. Our approach depends up cardiovascular risk factors, including dialysis vintage, duration of diabetes, and smoking history.</p><p>We perform cardiac catheterization in all candidates who are already on dialysis and who have had diabetes &gt;25 years, a smoking history, or other cardiovascular risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-selection-for-and-immunologic-issues-relating-to-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>].</p><p>Among all patients who have had diabetes for &le;25 years, are not on dialysis, are nonsmokers, and have no other cardiovascular risk factors, we perform noninvasive testing and reserve cardiac catheterization for those patients who have a positive noninvasive stress test. For patients who are able to exercise and achieve 85 percent maximum heart rate, we use an exercise stress test.</p><p>The requirement for catheterization in higher-risk patients is that a significant number of false-negative noninvasive stress results are observed among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-selection-for-and-immunologic-issues-relating-to-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Among patients who are not yet on dialysis, or who are on dialysis but have significant residual renal function, it is important to weigh the need for catheterization against the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy.</p><p>Given the significant mortality of waitlisted diabetic patients who are on dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-selection-for-and-immunologic-issues-relating-to-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], decisions regarding pretransplant catheterization and revascularization must be carefully considered, with the input of a cardiologist, if necessary. Significant coronary heart disease that is not amenable to revascularization may exclude candidates from pancreas transplant consideration.</p><p>Type 1 diabetic patients with ESRD who are determined not to be appropriate candidates for pancreas transplantation may still be appropriate candidates for kidney transplant alone (KTA) versus dialysis therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H110233183\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation of peripheral vascular disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Peripheral vascular disease is common among diabetic patients with ESRD and may prevent a successful anastomosis to the kidney allograft.

To identify patients with iliac calcifications, we screen all diabetic patients older than 45 years of age, or those with poor femoral pulses or evidence of vascular disease elsewhere (eg, coronary heart disease or cerebrovascular disease), with a noncontrast abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) scan. Many centers screen all diabetic pancreas transplant candidates with a noncontrast CT scan.</p><p>The diagnosis of peripheral vascular disease is difficult to establish in such patients because of the presence of medial artery calcifications that render vessels noncompressible for a standard ankle brachial index <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> toe brachial index.

Centers differ in regards to the surgical management of the exocrine secretions and the venous outflow.</p><p>After procurement, the arterial supply of the pancreas is reconstructed with a Y-graft, derived from the donor iliac artery bifurcation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-selection-for-and-immunologic-issues-relating-to-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]: The internal iliac or hypogastric artery is anastomosed to the splenic artery, and the common or external iliac artery is anastomosed to the superior mesenteric artery.</p><p>The donor Y-graft then is anastomosed to the recipient common or external iliac artery. The majority of enteric-drained pancreas transplants and the preferred approach utilize systemic venous drainage (ie, from the graft portal vein to the iliac vein) rather than drainage to the portal venous circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-selection-for-and-immunologic-issues-relating-to-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In 2010, 82 percent of SPK and 90 percent of pancreas transplants alone (PTAs) in United States were performed with systemic venous drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-selection-for-and-immunologic-issues-relating-to-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Portal vein drainage offers no significant metabolic benefits and may be associated with more thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-selection-for-and-immunologic-issues-relating-to-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Initially, management of the exocrine pancreas secretions was most commonly accomplished by bladder drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-selection-for-and-immunologic-issues-relating-to-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], whereby the duodenum is anastomosed side-to-side to the bladder. However, over the past decade, the preferred duct management technique has become enteric drainage, or the anastomosis of the donor duodenum to the recipient small bowel, with or without a Roux-en-Y. According to the International Pancreas Transplant Registry (IPTR) report of 2011 United States transplants, 91, 89, and 85 percent of SPK, pancreas after kidney (PAK), and PTA were enteric drained, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-selection-for-and-immunologic-issues-relating-to-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Patient and allograft survival appear to be similar with either bladder or enteric drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-selection-for-and-immunologic-issues-relating-to-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Enteric exocrine drainage is superior in terms of metabolic and bladder-related complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-selection-for-and-immunologic-issues-relating-to-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-32</a>].</p><p>The advantage of bladder drainage is the ability to use urine amylase to monitor for rejection in solitary pancreas transplants or pancreas transplants done after kidney transplant from a different donor (PAK). With SPK from a single donor, the serum creatinine can be used to monitor for kidney rejection and used as a surrogate for pancreas rejection. Isolated rejection of the pancreas without kidney involvement is rare in SPK.</p><p>As an example, a 2005 survey of 102 articles of both SPK transplants and PTAs found that urological complications were significantly more frequent with bladder versus enteric drainage (62 to 63 versus 12 to 20 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-selection-for-and-immunologic-issues-relating-to-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In addition, a retrospective study of 71 SPK patients found that, compared with bladder drainage, enteric drainage resulted in a significantly lower incidence of volume depletion (3 versus 34 percent), acidosis (0 versus 41 percent), pancreatitis (3 versus 40 percent), and urinary tract infection (27 versus 71 percent), although patient and pancreas allograft survival were similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-selection-for-and-immunologic-issues-relating-to-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. According to the IPTR, in bladder-drained pancreas recipients between 2000 and 2004, enteric conversion was required in 9 and 17 percent at one and three years posttransplant, respectively.</p><p>Preservation time of up to 30 hours in University of Wisconsin (UW) solution had no untoward effects on short- or long-term pancreas graft survival in earlier studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-selection-for-and-immunologic-issues-relating-to-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In a more recent study, preservation time exceeding 20 hours was associated with higher risk of technical failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-selection-for-and-immunologic-issues-relating-to-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Many centers target cold-ischemia times (CITs) of less than 12 hours, given the association of CIT with graft pancreatitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Segmental pancreas donation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With segmental pancreas donation, a segment of pancreas is donated by a living donor who is willing to undergo a hemipancreatectomy, and, in some countries, segments from cadaveric donors have been used. Live pancreas donation is associated with considerable surgical and medical complications for the donors.
