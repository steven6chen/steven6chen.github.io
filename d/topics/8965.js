Additional features of the tumor which may have prognostic significance are the number and percentage of positive core biopsies, the presence of tumor perineural invasion, and the presence of lymphovascular invasion. Although the eighth edition (2017) staging system does not take these additional factors into account, other prognostic models may incorporate some of these features.

Thus, no further staging work-up generally is indicated beyond the initial biopsy.</p><p>In patients with prostate cancer that has higher risk features and in men with a longer life expectancy, additional evaluation may be required. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H686719786\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluating extent of local disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation of local disease extent is typically accomplished with the combination of digital rectal examination (DRE) and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) at the time of biopsy.

The use of more powerful magnets (where available) has decreased the usage of endorectal MRI.

However, this approach can add morbidity to the surgery and is limited to those patients at significant risk for lymph node involvement, based upon the local extent of disease (T stage), serum PSA, and Gleason grade.

In this setting, the decision on whether or not to treat pelvic lymph nodes is based upon the probability of regional nodal involvement.

A CT-directed biopsy can be used to confirm metastasis if pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are seen.

Technetium-99 radionuclide bone scan remains the standard technique for identifying bone metastases when a diagnostic work-up is indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-staging-and-evaluation-of-men-with-newly-diagnosed-prostate-cancer/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H686719821\"><span class=\"h3\">Technetium-99 bone scan</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Technetium-99 radionuclide bone scan is the preferred technique for identifying bone metastases. However, bone scan is only recommended for symptomatic patients and asymptomatic men considered to be at increased risk for occult metastases (prognostic groups IIB, III, or IV: serum PSA &gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> or serum PSA &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> with a T2 primary tumor, or a Gleason 8 lesion, or a T3 or T4 primary tumor.) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-staging-and-evaluation-of-men-with-newly-diagnosed-prostate-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A positive bone scan in the absence of these high risk features is far more likely to represent a false positive than a true positive. (See <a href=\"#H686719765\" class=\"local\">'Prognostic stage groups'</a> above.)</p><p>In a review of 23 studies that examined the role of staging bone scans at the initial diagnosis, the detection rates for men with serum PSA levels of &lt;10, 10.1 to 19.9, and 20 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> were 2, 5, and 16 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-staging-and-evaluation-of-men-with-newly-diagnosed-prostate-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Combining the Gleason grade and serum PSA concentration with clinical stage may be particularly useful to predict the likelihood of a positive bone scan. As an example, in one series, only 3 of 308 men with Gleason grade 2 to 7 tumors, serum PSA concentration of 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> or less, and clinical stage T2b or less had a positive bone scan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-staging-and-evaluation-of-men-with-newly-diagnosed-prostate-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients.

Once a diagnosis of prostate cancer has been established, patients should be staged and assigned to a prognostic stage group based upon the American Joint Committee on Cancer <span class=\"nowrap\">(AJCC)/Union</span> for International Cancer Control (UICC) staging system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110729\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110729 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110728\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110728 \">table 1</a>). Factors influencing the extent of the staging evaluation include the patient's age and life expectancy, clinical stage of the primary tumor based upon the digital rectal examination, serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and Gleason score. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prostate-cancer-risk-stratification-and-choice-of-initial-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prostate cancer: Risk stratification and choice of initial treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H686719772\" class=\"local\">'Staging evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pretreatment assessment of the anatomic extent of the primary tumor (T) is based primarily upon the digital rectal examination. Imaging procedures such as MRI and transrectal ultrasonography may provide additional information in selected cases. This information is supplemented by information from the serum PSA and Gleason grade to assign patients to prognostic groups. (See <a href=\"#H686719786\" class=\"local\">'Evaluating extent of local disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H686719765\" class=\"local\">'Prognostic stage groups'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The assessment of regional lymph nodes (N) should be based upon the likelihood of their involvement by tumor. (See <a href=\"#H686719807\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of regional lymph nodes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In men with low-risk localized prostate cancer (ie, prognostic stage groups I and IIA), formal staging of regional lymph nodes is not indicated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with intermediate- or high-risk localized prostate cancer (prognostic stage groups IIB and III who will be managed with radical prostatectomy), an extended pelvic lymph node dissection is generally performed in conjunction with the prostatectomy to assess the regional lymphatics. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radionuclide bone scan is the initial screening procedure for symptomatic patients and those considered to be at increased risk for bone metastases (serum PSA &gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> or serum PSA&gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> with a T2 primary tumor, or a histologic grade group IV or V, or a T3 or T4 primary tumor). Axial skeleton MRI may be useful when the bone scan is equivocal.
