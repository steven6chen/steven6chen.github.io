The disease resembles the Budd-Chiari syndrome clinically; however, hepatic venous outflow obstruction in SOS is due to occlusion of the terminal hepatic venules and hepatic sinusoids rather than the hepatic veins and inferior vena cava.</p><p>The pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of SOS following HCT will be reviewed here. The prevention and treatment of this disorder are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatic-sinusoidal-obstruction-syndrome-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome following hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The term &quot;hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot; (HCT) will be used throughout this review as a general term to cover transplantation of progenitor cells from any source (eg, bone marrow, peripheral blood, cord blood). Otherwise, the source of such cells will be specified (eg, autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sources of hematopoietic stem cells&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8038149\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) typically occurs in the context of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). However, it may also be induced by treatment with monoclonal antibodies conjugated with calicheamicin (eg, gemtuzumab and inotuzumab) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hepatic-sinusoidal-obstruction-syndrome-veno-occlusive-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]; ingestion of pyrrolizidine alkaloids (eg, from herbal sources, such as bush tea and other herbal infusions) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hepatic-sinusoidal-obstruction-syndrome-veno-occlusive-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]; high dose radiation therapy to the liver (usually &gt;30 Gy) without cytoreductive chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hepatic-sinusoidal-obstruction-syndrome-veno-occlusive-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]; radioembolization of liver tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hepatic-sinusoidal-obstruction-syndrome-veno-occlusive-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]; and after liver transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hepatic-sinusoidal-obstruction-syndrome-veno-occlusive-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatotoxicity-due-to-herbal-medications-and-dietary-supplements\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatotoxicity due to herbal medications and dietary supplements&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Regardless of the cause, SOS is thought to begin with injury to the hepatic venous endothelium. The observation that preexisting liver disease increases the risk of developing SOS provides some insight into the pathogenesis of this disorder. Pre-existing liver disease may impair metabolism of drugs, and thus predispose to endothelial cell injury. In addition, patients with chronic hepatitis may have abnormalities in hepatic endothelial cells that could make them more susceptible to the cytoreductive regimen. Endothelial cells in patients with hepatitis may abnormally express adhesion molecules and procoagulant factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hepatic-sinusoidal-obstruction-syndrome-veno-occlusive-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].</p><p>Endothelial cell injury is seen in sinusoidal endothelial cells and hepatocytes in zone 3 of the liver acinus. Early pathologic changes include the deposition of fibrinogen and factor VIII within the venular walls and liver sinusoids, which may be dilated and congested by erythrocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hepatic-sinusoidal-obstruction-syndrome-veno-occlusive-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. Progressive venular occlusion occurs and ultimately leads to widespread zonal liver disruption and centrilobular hemorrhagic necrosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F63245\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63245 \">picture 1</a>). Later pathologic changes include deposition of collagen in the sinusoids, sclerosis of venular walls, fibrosis of venular lumens, and occlusion of terminal hepatic venules and intercalated veins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F76089\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76089 \">picture 2</a>). The severity of the clinical manifestations is proportional to the number and severity of these histologic changes, not solely to occlusion of the small hepatic venules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hepatic-sinusoidal-obstruction-syndrome-veno-occlusive-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Liver biopsy'</a> below.)</p><p>A procoagulant state, similar to that described in other chemotherapy-induced clotting disorders, is also seen in SOS. This state is characterized by low plasma levels of antithrombin and protein C, consumption of factor VII, and increased levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hepatic-sinusoidal-obstruction-syndrome-veno-occlusive-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-20</a>]. In addition, levels of von Willebrand factor (vWF) multimers are increased consistent with activation of coagulation and endothelial cell injury.

The incidence varies widely between studies depending upon baseline risk factors, the type of transplantation, the conditioning regimen used, and the criteria used for diagnosis. In one review summarizing the results of 135 studies, the mean incidence was approximately 14 percent, ranging from 0 to 62 percent across studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hepatic-sinusoidal-obstruction-syndrome-veno-occlusive-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>In children and infants, the incidence of SOS (estimated at 22 and 30 percent, respectively) following HCT is two- to threefold higher than in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hepatic-sinusoidal-obstruction-syndrome-veno-occlusive-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8038608\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain pretransplant characteristics (eg, pre-existing liver disease) and factors related to the transplant process (eg, conditioning therapy) are associated with the development of hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS). The strength of these associations varies among studies, and no factor alone or in combination explains the variability in the risk of developing SOS among patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F91604\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91604 \">table 1</a>).

In the largest series, the risk of developing SOS was 3 to 10 times greater in patients with an elevated serum AST concentration, and greater AST elevations were correlated with a higher incidence of severe SOS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hepatic-sinusoidal-obstruction-syndrome-veno-occlusive-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Whether specific forms of liver disease or the severity of the liver disease are associated with an increased risk is uncertain. Thus, the optimal pretransplantation evaluation of patients with suspected underlying liver disease is not established, particularly when weighed against the need for the transplant to treat the underlying malignancy. Patients with cirrhosis of the liver are at great risk for developing SOS; myeloablative conditioning should be avoided or in some instances the transplant itself may be deemed too risky.</p><p>Patients who are seropositive for hepatitis B surface antigen, but have only mild or no elevations in liver enzymes, may not have an increased risk of SOS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hepatic-sinusoidal-obstruction-syndrome-veno-occlusive-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

Most cases develop signs and symptoms within the first three weeks after HCT, with a peak around 12 days after HCT; later onset is seen in about 20 percent of children, but is unusual in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hepatic-sinusoidal-obstruction-syndrome-veno-occlusive-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/22,25,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,25,62</a>]. The vast majority of patients present with unexplained weight gain due to fluid and sodium retention, usually within three to six days post-transplant. This is followed by varying degrees of abnormalities in liver biochemical tests (hyperbilirubinemia and elevations in serum aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase) and the development of firm and painful hepatomegaly with ascites. Approximately half will develop renal insufficiency (hepatorenal syndrome) and one-quarter will require hemodialysis. Ultimately, a minority will advance to multiorgan failure, hepatic encephalopathy, and death. (See <a href=\"#H11797068\" class=\"local\">'Severity'</a> below.)</p><p>Not all clinical features may be present, and the severity of signs and symptoms can vary. In one report, the earliest features of hepatic SOS were sudden weight gain (an average of 11 kg) and the development of hepatomegaly or liver tenderness, which occurred in 98 and 92 percent of patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hepatic-sinusoidal-obstruction-syndrome-veno-occlusive-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. These signs usually occurred between day 3 and day 6 (by convention, day 0 is the day of hematopoietic cell infusion). Abdominal pain was localized to the mid epigastrium or the right upper quadrant. Peripheral edema occurred in more than one-half of patients, and ascites in approximately 20 percent.</p><p>Liver biochemical tests usually reveal an elevation in serum aminotransferases and hyperbilirubinemia (mostly conjugated). In severe disease, an elevation in the prothrombin time and deterioration of other measures of hepatic synthetic function may be present. Hyperbilirubinemia tends to occur after the onset of weight gain and hepatomegaly. One study reported that the average time for a rise in serum bilirubin &gt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> was at day 6, and peak levels occurring during the subsequent course ranged from 12 to 18 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hepatic-sinusoidal-obstruction-syndrome-veno-occlusive-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

These features of SOS are probably a direct result of the liver injury, although the precise mechanisms are unknown.

SOS can occur at any time point in the post-HCT setting, but most commonly occurs within the first three weeks after HCT. The diagnosis of SOS can be readily made on clinical grounds alone in the patient who fulfills either the modified Seattle criteria or Baltimore criteria described below. (See <a href=\"#H11796224\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> below.)</p><p>However, other liver disorders are common during HCT, and additional testing may be required in patients presenting with clinical features of the disease in whom the diagnosis is in question. We general perform the following tests in most patients with suspected SOS:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prothrombin <span class=\"nowrap\">time/International</span> Normalized Ratio (INR)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum chemistries (sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, lactate dehydrogenase)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver blood tests (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase [GGT], total and direct bilirubin, albumin)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete blood count</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Viral hepatitis serologies (hepatitis B surface antigen, anti-hepatitis B core IgM, hepatitis B virus DNA, anti-hepatitis C virus antibodies, hepatitis C virus RNA, anti-herpes simplex virus antibodies, CMV-specific IgM antibodies), if not performed prior to HCT</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amylase and lipase</p><p/><p>Ultrasonography with Doppler studies is not diagnostic for SOS, but is commonly used to exclude extrahepatic biliary obstruction.

A liver biopsy can be diagnostic of SOS, although changes associated with SOS may sometimes be patchy and missed in a small sample. Percutaneous liver biopsy is seldom used for the diagnosis of SOS, in part because the concurrent thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy in patients undergoing HCT may lead to a substantial risk of bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hepatic-sinusoidal-obstruction-syndrome-veno-occlusive-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. A transjugular liver biopsy (in which a sample of liver tissue is obtained intrahepatically by accessing the venous system through the jugular vein) may be a safer way to obtain liver tissue in patients who are high risk for a percutaneous approach, and produce specimens of adequate size for interpretation. However, even this approach may carry substantial risk in patients undergoing HCT. An illustrative study included 60 HCT patients with liver dysfunction who underwent a transjugular liver biopsy and measurement of hepatic venous pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hepatic-sinusoidal-obstruction-syndrome-veno-occlusive-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].

In a series of 355 patients undergoing HCT, 22 percent developed liver disorders that shared clinical features of SOS including graft-versus host disease, hyperbilirubinemia associated with sepsis syndrome (cholestasis lenta), cardiac failure, persistent tumor infiltration of the liver, or a combination of these processes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hepatic-sinusoidal-obstruction-syndrome-veno-occlusive-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/23,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,38</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8038408\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) is a clinical diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hepatic-sinusoidal-obstruction-syndrome-veno-occlusive-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].

Some of the most pertinent entities include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Budd-Chiari syndrome</strong> &ndash; The clinical presentation of hepatic SOS is indistinguishable from that of the acute form of Budd-Chiari syndrome. While hepatic venous outflow obstruction in SOS is due to occlusion of the terminal hepatic venules and hepatic sinusoids, Budd-Chiari syndrome is due to obstruction of hepatic veins and inferior vena cava. Budd-Chiari syndrome can be established noninvasively by the demonstration of thrombosis of the hepatic veins <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the intrahepatic or suprahepatic inferior vena cava on ultrasonography with Doppler studies, computed tomography (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance angiography (MRI angiography).

However, patients with hepatic dysfunction due to GVHD usually have concurrent involvement of the skin and gastrointestinal tract. Although the concurrent presence of the characteristic rash provides suggestive clinical evidence, biopsy is the most definitive method to distinguish GVHD of the liver from SOS. However, biopsy is rarely performed because of the bleeding risk.

These include hepatitis or other viruses (eg, CMV, VZV, EBV, HHV6, adenovirus), and chronic Candidiasis (so called hepatosplenic Candidiasis). The most likely causes depend at least partially upon the timing after transplantation. This is discussed in more detail separately.
