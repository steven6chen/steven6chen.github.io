ASD encompasses disorders previously known as autistic disorder (classic autism, sometimes called early infantile autism, childhood autism, or Kanner's autism), childhood disintegrative disorder, pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified, and Asperger disorder (also known as Asperger syndrome).

The clinical features are similar, whether the child is ultimately diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (with various specifiers) using DSM-5 or a specific type of pervasive developmental disorder using <a href=\"http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/bluebook.pdf&amp;token=a1rnp4ylEWj+55Hg2/MxBV68bg4+OoJ3xv4NsWiLS9BTc28fIYbXOOvZb4xBnOxk23OUQPYWZSl7O3w2XdkQNQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=627\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">ICD-10</a>. One critical difference is that the ICD-10 requires symptoms to have onset before age three years, whereas DSM-5 does not include an age cut-off, indicating that symptoms may not become manifest until social demands exceed limited capacities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autism-spectrum-disorder-diagnosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autism spectrum disorder: Diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic criteria'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autism-spectrum-disorder-terminology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autism spectrum disorder: Terminology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Terminology'</a>.) </p><p>Symptoms of ASD most commonly are recognized in the second year of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>], but may be present earlier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. By definition, symptoms of ASD must be present in the early developmental period, but they may not be apparent until later (ie, when social demands exceed limited capacities) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Symptoms in children with the least severe phenotypes of ASD may not be apparent to parents or teachers until four to six years of age or later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The ICD-10 continues to have require that symptoms be present before three years of age.

Approximately two-thirds of patients with ASD present with lack of acquisition of communication skills during the first two years of life. Approximately one-fourth to one-third of children with ASD achieve early language milestones, but have regression of language, communication, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> social skills between 15 to 24 months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features/abstract/4,13,15-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,13,15-20</a>]. The regression of skills can be gradual or sudden, and may occur in the context of preexisting developmental delays or atypical development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features/abstract/15,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,21</a>]. Regression of skills is an important characteristic of ASD; attribution of regression to stressors, such as the birth of a new sibling or moving to a new home, may delay the diagnosis of ASD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">IMPAIRED SOCIAL COMMUNICATION AND INTERACTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Impaired social communication is a hallmark of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Delays and deviations in language development are one of the most common presenting complaints of parents of children with ASD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. In addition to delayed or deviant language skills, children with ASD often lack the intent to communicate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The impairments in social communication are pervasive and sustained though they may present later in life than needed by prior criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H444943257\"><span class=\"h2\">Social reciprocity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals with ASD have deficits in social or emotional reciprocity. Younger children may be unaware of other children (including siblings) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. They may lack empathy for another's emotional perspective (eg, unable to sense that another is in pain). They are not interested in imitating others or in bringing a novel object to a trusted individual to show.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H424582100\"><span class=\"h3\">Joint attention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals with ASD may lack or show reduced spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment, interests, or achievements with other people (ie, impaired joint attention or social referencing) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Joint attention is a spontaneous behavior in which an infant or toddler tries to share interest, amusement, or apprehension about an object with a caretaker or playmate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The child does this by purposefully looking back and forth between the object of interest and the eyes of the caretaker or playmate (usually by 8 to 10 months of age), or by pointing to the object (protodeclarative pointing, usually by 14 to 16 months of age). Protodeclarative pointing is distinguished from protoimperative pointing, in which the infant points to an object, usually out of reach, in order to obtain it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Children with ASD often lack joint attention (but not protoimperative pointing). They may be content with passive play, often described by their parents as &quot;good&quot; infants and toddlers, undemanding of attention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonverbal communication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals with ASD have impaired ability to use and interpret nonverbal behaviors such as eye-to-eye gaze, facial expression, gestures, and body postures. They have difficulty reading nonverbal emotional cues. During infancy, parents may notice that the baby resists cuddling, avoids eye contact, or fails to spread the arms in anticipation of being picked up, although these behaviors are not universal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Social relationships</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals with ASD fail to develop and maintain peer relationships appropriate to their developmental level. Younger children may have little or no interest in developing friendships. They may prefer solitary play to social play, involving others in activities only as tools or &quot;mechanical&quot; aids (ie, using the hand of a parent to obtain a desired object without making eye contact) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Older children may become more interested in social interaction, but lack understanding of what behavior is appropriate in one situation but not another or the needs of others (eg, having little sense of boundaries, repeating memorized information regardless of its appropriateness).</p><p>Few children with ASD are so socially isolated that they fail to interact with a loved family member, but purposeful social interaction is usually subdued or intermittent, without the expected joy and reciprocity seen in typical peers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Parents of such children may describe them as independent rather than aloof, and may be proud of their apparent self-sufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Parents seem to feel the lack of interactive initiative and responsiveness of their babies and increasingly try to supply soliciting behaviors as early as 18 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">RESTRICTED AND REPETITIVE BEHAVIOR, INTERESTS, AND ACTIVITIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Restricted and repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, activities, or interests and hyper- or hyposensitivity to sensory input are another core symptom of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autism-spectrum-disorder-diagnosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autism spectrum disorder: Diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic criteria'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7611398\"><span class=\"h2\">Stereotyped behaviors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms or complex whole-body movements (eg, hand or finger flapping or twisting, rocking, swaying, dipping, walking on tip-toe [toe walking]) are another feature of ASD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. Children with ASD may line up an exact number of playthings in the same manner in a stereotyped ritual, without apparent awareness of what the toys represent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features/abstract/4,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,31</a>]. Other stereotyped behaviors may echolalia and idiosyncratic phrases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Motor mannerisms are reported in 37 to 95 percent of individuals with ASD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Motor mannerisms often manifest during the preschool years. Stereotyped motor mannerisms appear to be self-stimulating and may also be self-injurious [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Self-injurious behaviors are more common among ASD patients with cognitive disability and include head-banging, face or body slapping, self-biting, or self-pinching. The triggers for these behaviors may be predictable (frustration, anxiety, excitement) or seemingly random.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7611496\"><span class=\"h2\">Insistence on sameness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals with ASD have significant difficulty with transitions and may need the same routine identically every day. Apparently inflexible adherence to specific, nonfunctional routines or rituals is characteristic of ASD. These may manifest during various aspects of daily life, such as the need to always eat particular foods in a specific order or to follow the same route from one place to another without deviation. The play of children with ASD may appear to be scripted, mimicking of what has been seen on television. The insistence on sameness may manifest with distress at small changes in routines and difficulty with transitions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Restricted interests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Encompassing preoccupation with one or more stereotyped and restricted patterns of interest that is abnormal in either intensity or focus and persistent preoccupation with unusual objects is characteristic of ASD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>In younger children, preoccupations may center on peculiar sensory or perceptual arousal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] (see <a href=\"#H545043729\" class=\"local\">'Sensory perception'</a> below). The preoccupations of older children and those who are more cognitively able may include weather, dates, schedules, phone numbers, license plates, Thomas the Tank Engine, Pok&eacute;mon, or subtypes of any classification (eg, dinosaurs, dogs, planes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features/abstract/1,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,25</a>].
