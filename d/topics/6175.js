Transmission rarely occurs through blood transfusion, organ transplantation, or congenitally. <em>Babesia</em> protozoa infect mammals and cause lysis of host red blood cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/babesiosis-microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>The microbiology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of babesiosis will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of babesiosis are discussed separately.

Initially considered as a single species, <em>B. microti</em> appears to be genetically diverse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/babesiosis-microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In fact, <em>B. microti</em> may be a genus on its own that ranks equally to the <em>Babesia</em> sensu stricto genus (clades 3 and 4, see below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/babesiosis-microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clade 2 contains <em>Babesia duncani</em> (WA1, WA2, CA5, CA6) and <em>B. duncani</em>&ndash;related organisms (CA1, CA3, CA4), the main etiologic agents of human babesiosis along the Pacific coast of the United States.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clade 3 contains <em>Babesia divergens</em> isolates from cattle in Europe, <em>B. divergens</em>&ndash;like organisms identified in humans in Europe and the United States, and <em>Babesia venatorum</em>, identified in humans in Europe and mainland China.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clade 4 contains <em>Babesia</em> species that rarely infect humans. These include <em>Babesia bovis</em> and <em>Babesia bigemina</em>, which typically infect cattle, and <em>Babesia</em> KO1, which was isolated from a patient in South Korea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/babesiosis-microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p>The phylogenetic classification is generally consistent with classifications based on morphology and life cycle characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/babesiosis-microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/3,4,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,9,10</a>]. Trophozoites of <em>Babesia</em> in clades 1 and 2 are small in diameter (&lt;3 microns) and form up to four merozoites arranged in a tetrad (&quot;Maltese cross&quot;). Transmission of <em>Babesia</em> in clades 1 and 2 is transstadial (eg, from larvae to nymphs and nymphs to adults) but not transovarial (from adults to eggs), indicating that vertebrate hosts are an absolute requirement for their maintenance in the tick life cycle.</p><p>Trophozoites of <em>Babesia </em>in clades 3 and 4 typically are large in diameter (&gt;3 microns) and form only two merozoites. Exceptions to these phenotypes within clade 3 include <em>Babesia</em> that infect humans, such as <em>B. divergens</em>, <em>B. divergens</em>&ndash;like organisms, and <em>B. venatorum</em>. In human red blood cells, their trophozoites are small in diameter (&lt;3 microns) and their merozoites can be arranged in tetrads [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/babesiosis-microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Transmission of <em>Babesia</em> in clades 3 and 4 is both transovarial and transstadial, suggesting that vertebrate hosts are not essential for their short-term maintenance in the tick life cycle. These organisms are referred to as &quot;true&quot; <em>Babesia</em> species or as <em>Babesia</em> species &quot;sensu stricto.&quot;</p><p>Both <em>Babesia</em> and <em>Plasmodium</em> parasites invade red blood cells. They differ in that <em>Plasmodium</em> species are transmitted by mosquitoes from person to person using humans as reservoir hosts, have a pre-erythrocytic (hepatic) stage, and leave hemozoin deposit in red blood cells. In contrast, <em>Babesia</em> species are transmitted by ticks, are not transmitted from person to person but rather use mammals as reservoir hosts, lack a pre-erythrocytic stage, and do not leave hemozoin deposit in red blood cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/babesiosis-microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/3,4,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1027446656\"><span class=\"h2\">United States</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Babesia microti</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>B. microti</em> is the predominant etiologic agent of babesiosis in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/babesiosis-microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

In New York State alone, more than 4600 cases of babesiosis have been reported since 1986 (when reporting became mandatory), of which approximately 3500 were reported between 2006 and 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/babesiosis-microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The incidence of babesiosis increased even in areas previously regarded as areas of low endemicity, such as the Lower Hudson Valley.</p><p>Given that the geographic range and the number of cases have steadily increased, babesiosis is considered an emerging infectious disease. The increase in incidence may be due to several factors including expanding deer population with concomitant increased tick density, increased human habitat in wooded areas, and heightened community awareness. Deer numbers have increased due to reforestation, lack of predators, and insufficient culling of the herd.</p><p>Seroprevalence varies by location, year, time of year, and population surveyed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F64802\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64802 \">table 1</a>). In the Northeast and upper Midwest, <em>B. microti</em> seroprevalence in healthy blood donors has been measured between 0.5 and 16 percent. The discrepancy between seroprevalence and the prevalence of clinical disease suggests that asymptomatic and self-limited infection is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/babesiosis-microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A carefully designed epidemiologic study found that about 20 percent of adults and 40 percent of children experience asymptomatic infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/babesiosis-microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Red blood cells (RBCs) from infected mice (or other vertebrate hosts) accumulate in the mid-gut of the tick larva where <em>Babesia</em> gametocytes are released. Male and female gametocytes fuse to form a zygote, which crosses the gut epithelium. Zygotes become ookinetes, which reach the hemolymph and migrate to the tick salivary gland where they hypertrophy into sporoblasts. Sporoblasts remain dormant while the larva overwinters.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tick larvae molt into nymphs in the spring (year 3). <em>B. microti</em> is transmitted from larvae to nymphs (transstadial transmission).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tick nymphs, the primary vector for <em>B. microti</em> transmission, feed on white-footed mice in early summer (year 3). They also feed on humans, but humans are dead-end hosts. Sporozoites are delivered to the vertebrate dermis 36 to 72 hours after nymphal attachment; therefore, tick removal during the first 24 to 36 hours of attachment greatly minimizes the risk of transmission. Sporozoites migrate to the bloodstream where they invade erythrocytes and mature into merozoites. Merozoites are released into the bloodstream and invade nearby erythrocytes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=babesiosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Babesiosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Microscopy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tick nymphs molt into adults in the fall (year 3).

Most cases of transfusion-transmitted babesiosis occur from June through November (consistent with the seasonality of tick-acquired babesiosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/babesiosis-microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Transfusion-transmitted babesiosis may occur at any time of year, however, because asymptomatic infection can persist for more than a year and because the incubation period after blood transfusion can be as long as six months. Transfusion-transmitted babesiosis usually is reported from endemic areas but can occur outside of endemic areas when donors residing in nonendemic areas become infected while traveling in endemic areas or contaminated blood products donated in endemic areas are exported to nonendemic areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/babesiosis-microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing#H1973008044\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood donor screening: Laboratory testing&quot;, section on 'Babesia microti'</a>.)</p><p>More than 200 transfusion-transmitted cases of babesiosis have been described, mostly in the past two decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/babesiosis-microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/2,21,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,21,23</a>]. The incidence of transfusion-transmitted babesiosis in the United States is 1.1 case per million of RBC units distributed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/babesiosis-microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In Rhode Island (an endemic area), the risk for transfusion-transmitted babesiosis between 1999 and 2007 was approximately 1 case per 15,000 RBC units transfused [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/babesiosis-microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In Connecticut (another endemic area), the risk of acquiring <em>B. microti</em> from a RBC unit between 2005 and 2007 was estimated at 1 case per 60,000 RBC units distributed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/babesiosis-microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Cases of transfusion-transmitted babesiosis have a median age of 65 years; two-thirds of patients are &gt;50 years, whereas 10 percent are neonates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/babesiosis-microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Transfusion-transmitted babesiosis often is severe because recipients of blood products frequently are immunocompromised or have coexisting medical conditions. Approximately 20 percent of transfusion-transmitted babesiosis cases have been fatal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/babesiosis-microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The most frequent conditions or procedures associated with transfusion-transmitted babesiosis include hematologic disorders, cardiovascular surgery or procedures, gastrointestinal bleeding or surgery, and complications of prematurity in the newborn. Transfusion-transmitted babesiosis also has occurred in patients who have undergone posttraumatic splenectomy or organ transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/babesiosis-microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Most cases of transfusion-transmitted babesiosis involve packed RBCs. A small number of cases have been attributed to platelet units contaminated with RBCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/babesiosis-microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Typically, liquid-stored RBCs are involved; frozen deglycerolized RBCs are seldom implicated. The median age of liquid-stored RBCs at time of transfusion is 16 days; in a few cases, RBC units implicated in transfusion-transmission cases were stored for as long as 42 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/babesiosis-microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Issues related to blood donor evaluation are discussed separately.

The release of merozoites from erythrocytes and associated loss of cell membrane integrity cause hemolysis that is associated with many of the clinical manifestations and complications of babesiosis, including fever, anemia, jaundice, hemoglobinuria, and renal insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/babesiosis-microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The spleen plays a critical role in protection against <em>Babesia</em> infection because it contains macrophages, which ingest and clear infected erythrocytes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=babesiosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Babesiosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hemolysis contributes to (but does not account entirely for) the anemia associated with babesiosis, which typically is more prolonged than parasitemia. <em>Babesia </em>parasites generate reactive oxygen species; membrane lipid peroxidation decreases red blood cell deformability, thereby promoting red blood cell clearance by splenic macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/babesiosis-microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].

Anemia is coupled with increased erythropoiesis as evidenced by reticulocytosis.</p><p>The role of antibodies in host defense against <em>Babesia </em>is not fully understood. Mouse models of <em>B. microti</em> infection indicate that antibodies are not critical for clearing the infection because lack of mature B cells in otherwise immunocompetent mice does not alter their resistance to <em>B. microti</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/babesiosis-microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,72</a>]. In immunocompromised patients, however, antibodies appear to be of critical importance because patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> (anti-CD20) for B cell lymphoma or an autoimmune disorder are at risk for persistent or relapsing babesiosis.

The main source of IFN-gamma appears to be CD4+ T cells in <em>B. microti</em> infection but NK cells in <em>B. duncani</em> infection. IFN-gamma upregulates the surface expression of MHC class II molecules on antigen-presenting cells and upregulates inflammatory cytokine gene expression.</p><p>Symptoms of babesiosis, such as fever, headache, and myalgia, are characteristics of viral-like illnesses and are suggestive of a host inflammatory response involving pyrogenic cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL-) 6. Both cytokines were detected in the blood of a patient with mild babesiosis caused by <em>B. microti</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/babesiosis-microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/3,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,65</a>]. Inflammatory cytokines also may contribute to the complications associated with severe babesiosis, such as acute lung injury. In mice infected with <em>B. duncani</em>, pulmonary manifestations include edema and intravascular margination of leukocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/babesiosis-microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].

The primary mode of transmission is a tick bite. Rarely, transmission occurs via blood transfusion, solid organ transplantation, or transplacentally. <em>Babesia</em> species are classified in four clades based on their molecular genetic characteristics. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Babesia microti</em> is the predominant species causing human babesiosis in the United States. Babesiosis due to <em>B. microti</em> is endemic in the northeastern United States (particularly in the coastal counties and on the islands off the coast of southern New England) and in the upper Midwest. (See <a href=\"#H1027446656\" class=\"local\">'United States'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The transmission cycle of <em>B. microti</em> includes ticks, mice, and deer. Adult <em>Ixodes scapularis</em> ticks feed on white-tailed deer (which are not competent reservoirs for <em>B. microti</em>), whereas tick larvae and nymphs feed on white-footed mice (the primary reservoir for <em>B. microti</em>). Nymphs are primary vectors for transmission to humans, which are incidental hosts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F65153\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65153 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Babesia divergens</em> is the principal species causing human babesiosis in Europe. The transmission cycle includes ticks and cattle, and the disease occurs sporadically. <em>Babesia venatorum</em> is endemic in northeastern China, while <em>B. microti</em> has been reported in southwestern China. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Europe'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4264239666\" class=\"local\">'Asia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tick feeding introduces sporozoites into the dermis of the vertebrate host. Sporozoites eventually reach the circulation, where they invade red blood cells. Within red cells, sporozoites differentiate into trophozoites, and asexual replication of trophozoites generates two to four merozoites. Egress of merozoites is accompanied by rupture of the host cell. Free merozoites in turn invade nearby red blood cells. (See <a href=\"#H2836481655\" class=\"local\">'Tick bite'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anemia and fever are major features of babesiosis. Anemia results, in part, from the hemolysis of red blood cells upon egress of merozoites. Red blood cell clearance also may result from decreased deformability <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> from opsonization. Proinflammatory cytokines likely cause fever.
