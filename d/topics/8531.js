(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-gene-mutations-and-clinical-genetic-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Gene mutations and clinical genetic testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p>HCM is characterized by an enormous diversity in both phenotypic expression and clinical course (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F58156\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58156 \">figure 1</a>). The location, pattern, and extent of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) are heterogeneous, although the most common location for increased wall thickness is the basal anterior septum in continuity with the anterior free wall. HCM patients can develop one or more of the following morphologic abnormalities:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LV outflow tract obstruction (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-morphologic-variants-and-the-pathophysiology-of-left-ventricular-outflow-tract-obstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Morphologic variants and the pathophysiology of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diastolic dysfunction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myocardial ischemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mitral regurgitation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systolic dysfunction (ie, end-stage; ejection fraction &lt;50 percent)</p><p/><p>These structural and functional abnormalities can produce a variety of symptoms, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fatigue</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dyspnea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpitations</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presyncope or syncope</p><p/><p>In broad terms, the symptoms related to HCM can be categorized as those related to heart failure (HF), chest pain, or arrhythmias. Patients with HCM have an increased incidence of both supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias and are at an increased risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-prevalence-pathophysiology-and-management-of-concurrent-atrial-arrhythmias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Prevalence, pathophysiology, and management of concurrent atrial arrhythmias&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-assessment-and-management-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-and-sudden-cardiac-death-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Assessment and management of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death risk&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For the majority of patients with HCM, LVH is not progressive, and the clinical course is relatively benign. A small subset of patients, however, will progress to an end-stage form of the disease that is characterized by systolic dysfunction with other adverse LV remodeling such as LV dilation and wall thinning present in some end-stage patients as well. Such patients are managed according to the standard approach to patients with HF due to systolic dysfunction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the therapy of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The natural history of HCM will be reviewed here. Other issues such as the clinical manifestations, diagnosis and evaluation, and treatment of this disorder are discussed separately.

In the majority of HCM patients, LV wall thickness measurements do not typically change once early adulthood is reached. However, progressive wall thinning may occur in patients with initially severe hypertrophy. In a series of 106 patients with initial wall thickness &ge;30 mm, more than 5 mm of wall thinning was seen in 41 of the 71 patients who underwent serial assessment (58 percent); the duration of follow-up was a significant predictor of thinning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>A multitude of pathologic studies in children and young adults with HCM who died suddenly demonstrated that increased wall thickness is due to myocyte hypertrophy and an expanded extracellular matrix composed of interstitial and replacement fibrosis. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The mechanisms leading to increased collagen matrix in HCM are not well defined but may be mediated by angiotensin II, an observation supported by studies using genetic mouse models of HCM in which increased interstitial fibrosis was attenuated by an angiotensin II receptor blocker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-gene-mutations-and-clinical-genetic-testing#H3988232\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Gene mutations and clinical genetic testing&quot;, section on 'Renin-angiotensin system polymorphisms'</a>.)</p><p>The amount and distribution of hypertrophy in patients with HCM may be related to the underlying genetic mutation. In a study comparing 150 patients with one of the more commonly seen thick filament mutations (eg, myosin heavy chain, myosin binding protein C) with 80 patients with one of the rarer thin filament mutations (eg, troponin T or I, alpha-tropomyosin, cardiac actin), patients with a thin filament mutation had significantly less hypertrophy, which was more often in an atypical location (ie, not the basal <span class=\"nowrap\">septum/anterior</span> wall), and were less likely to have LV outflow tract obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. While there was no difference in rate of ventricular arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death depending on the mutation in this study, patients with a thin filament mutation were more likely to develop severe heart failure (HF) symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-gene-mutations-and-clinical-genetic-testing#H22623485\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Gene mutations and clinical genetic testing&quot;, section on 'Mutations in sarcomeric protein genes'</a>.) </p><p>A separate study has also shown evidence that serum markers of myocardial fibrosis may be present in HCM family members who carry a disease causing mutation but no LVH (genotype <span class=\"nowrap\">positive/phenotype</span> negative). Levels of serum C-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PICP) were significantly higher in mutation carriers without LV as compared with controls (31 percent higher). It remains unresolved whether increases in serum markers of collagen turnover reflect a true increase in myocardial fibrosis in genotype positive phenotype negative patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Cardiovascular magnetic resonance'</a>.)</p><p>The presence of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) on contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging represents myocardial fibrosis. In one systemic review of LGE in patients with HCM, which included 1063 patients from four cohorts, 60 percent of patients had LGE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. While the numbers of events were small, those patients with LGE had significantly higher total mortality (odds ratio [OR] 4.5; 95% CI 1.5-13.0), cardiac mortality (OR 2.9; 95% CI 1.0-8.4), and HF mortality (OR 5.7; 95% CI 1.0-31.1) compared with patients without LGE. The role of CMR in patients with HCM is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Cardiovascular magnetic resonance'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Late onset disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although most HCM disease expression develops during childhood and adolescence, late-onset disease is recognized (ie, LVH developing between ages 20 and 50 years) and was first noted in patients with mutations in cardiac myosin binding protein-C. Most cross-sectional studies of families with mutations in the cardiac myosin binding protein-C gene, which account for approximately 15 percent of cases of familial HCM, have shown that the proportion of proven carriers of the mutation who have hypertrophy increases with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>].</p><p>In one cross-sectional study of 16 probands and 574 family members at risk, 58 percent of patients aged less than 50 years with a mutation in the cardiac myosin binding protein C gene had hypertrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, a later age at onset with cardiac myosin binding protein-C gene mutations has not been noted in all series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-gene-mutations-and-clinical-genetic-testing#H3987144\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Gene mutations and clinical genetic testing&quot;, section on 'Cardiac myosin binding protein-C gene'</a>.)</p><p>In contrast to familial early-onset HCM (which results from defects in the beta myosin heavy chain, cardiac troponin T, and alpha tropomyosin genes in more than 45 percent of cases), elderly-onset HCM is in some series associated with mutations in the cardiac myosin binding protein-C, troponin I, and alpha myosin heavy chain genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In addition, the likelihood of identifying any mutation may be lower in late onset HCM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>Additionally, HCM patients who are identified late in life (age &gt;60 years) are at low risk for HCM-related death or adverse events compared with early-onset disease. Within one cohort of 428 patients presenting at age 60 years or greater who were followed for an average of six years, 89 percent of the deaths (133 out of 149) were non-HCM related, with HCM-related mortality of only 0.6 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In addition, a substantial proportion of elderly HCM patients also had &ge;1 conventional risk factors for sudden death. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-morphologic-variants-and-the-pathophysiology-of-left-ventricular-outflow-tract-obstruction#H2424449019\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Morphologic variants and the pathophysiology of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction&quot;, section on 'Obstructive HCM in elderly adults'</a>.)</p><p>In a small subset of patients, sigmoid septal morphology (with maximal LV wall thickness &ge;15 mm) is part of the phenotypic spectrum of HCM. A sigmoid shaped basal septum can also be observed in elderly individuals without HCM, but in these cases the maximal wall thickness of the septum is normal. Among HCM patients, this morphologic subtype appears to be less commonly associated with a mutation than other morphologic variants.

Primary forms are uncommon, while secondary forms usually present at the advanced stage of an infiltrative disease (sarcoidosis, amyloidosis) or a systemic storage disease (eg, hemochromatosis). Idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy is uncommon, and may be familial and present in children and young adults. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=idiopathic-restrictive-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Several observations suggest that idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy may be part of the spectrum of familial HCM:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some cases of restrictive cardiomyopathy have extensive myocyte and myofibrillar disarray at explant or postmortem, findings similar to those seen in HCM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients with primary restrictive cardiomyopathy have a family history of HCM, and mutations in sarcomeric contractile protein genes can lead to restrictive <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> HCM within the same family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>].</p><p/><p>The frequency and clinical significance of this relationship was illustrated in 1226 patients from 688 consecutive HCM families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A restrictive phenotype was seen in 19 patients (1.5 percent) and was associated with a relatively poor prognosis, with a 44 percent rate of death, heart transplantation, or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator discharge. Genotyping was feasible in 15 of 16 probands: mutations were found in eight, four in the beta-myosin heavy chain gene and four in the cardiac troponin I gene. A troponin I mutation has also been identified in six of nine unrelated individuals transplanted for idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

In some patients, there is cavity dilation and wall thinning due to a process of extensive myocardial fibrosis, as demonstrated by histologic examination in hearts removed at time of heart transplant and on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with extensive late gadolinium enhancement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F81390\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81390 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/2,19-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,19-24</a>]. Not all patients in the end stage will demonstrate cavity dilation or wall thinning, and therefore the unifying definition is considered when a patient achieves an EF &lt;50 percent.</p><p>This phase has been termed &quot;end-stage&quot; or &quot;burned out&quot; HCM. The mechanism is uncertain, but diffuse myocardial ischemia due to microvascular dysfunction leading to a process of substantial cell death and repair process in the form of myocardial replacement fibrosis may be important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Among a cohort of 30 patients with end-stage HCM who underwent transplantation, histologic review of the explanted heart revealed extensive myocardial fibrosis averaging 37 percent of the total myocardium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The degree of microvascular dysfunction assessed by quantitative PET imaging is an independent predictor of clinical deterioration and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. End-stage HCM is associated with a high mortality rate and overall poor prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/23,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,27</a>].</p><p>The frequency of progression to a dilated, hypokinetic phenotype was evaluated in a series of 222 patients with HCM who were prospectively followed for a mean of 11 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eleven patients (5 percent) had a dilated, hypokinetic phenotype at initial evaluation.

The rate of decline in EF was approximately 0.5 percent per year. These patients, compared with those with HCM and preserved LV function, were younger and more likely to have had a family history of HCM (61 versus 26 percent) or sudden death (43 versus 19 percent) and had a greater wall thickness at presentation. During follow-up, they had a significantly lower rate of cardiovascular death-free survival.</p><p/><p>The characteristics of end-stage HCM were further evaluated in a retrospective analysis combining three cohorts that included a total of 1259 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. End-stage HCM was defined as an LVEF &lt;50 percent. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>44 patients (3.5 percent) were classified as end-stage. Of these, 11 were diagnosed at study entry and 33 during follow-up, with an annual incidence of 1.1 cases per 100 person-years. The mean age at diagnosis of end-stage was 45 years, but there was a very wide range (14 to 74 years).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with LVEF &lt;50 percent, LV remodeling and cavity dilation were common (52 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The average duration from the onset of HCM symptoms to end-stage HCM was 14 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once end-stage HCM developed, further deterioration was rapid, and 66 percent of patients progressed to death from progressive HF, sudden cardiac death, or transplantation over a mean of 2.7 years.

Early detection of LV dysfunction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dilation should prompt consideration of more aggressive interventions, including standard drug treatment for systolic HF (eg, angiotensin converting enzyme or aldosterone inhibitors), possibly biventricular pacing, and early consideration for heart transplantation, although there are little if any data other than expert opinion regarding the efficacy of standard HF drug therapies. In addition, the role of biventricular pacing in patients with HCM and systolic dysfunction does not appear particularly favorable as a number of small studies have failed to demonstrate improvements in ejection fraction, HF symptoms, or a decrease in the need for advanced HF therapies including cardiac transplantation. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>From the Mayo Clinic cohort of 2073 patients with HCM, nine patients were identified with HCM and LVEF &lt;50 percent who had received cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT); these patients were matched with control subjects with HCM in a 1:1 fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Development of hypertrophy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A small proportion of patients with HCM (&lt;5 percent) will develop the high-risk phenotype of end-stage disease, associated with reduced systolic function (EF &lt;50 percent). In some cases, there is relative left ventricular dilation and wall thinning, with greater resemblance to the morphologic and functional features of dilated cardiomyopathy. End-stage disease raises consideration for aggressive therapy, including consideration for primary prevention ICD, conventional heart failure (HF) therapy, and early consideration for transplant evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'End-stage HCM'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HCM is compatible with normal life expectancy for the majority of patients, with annual mortality rates of referral-based HCM populations of 1 percent, with the major causes of death being sudden cardiac death (SCD), HF, and stroke. SCD is more common in young patients, while death from HF or stroke is more common in mid-life and beyond. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Mortality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progression to NYHA class III or IV HF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52683 \">table 1</a>) occurs in a minority of patients with HCM and is most often associated with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (&ge;30 mmHg). Progression to severe HF symptoms is associated with a marked increase in cardiovascular mortality, particularly in non-obstructed HCM patients. In patients with obstruction and class <span class=\"nowrap\">III/IV</span> symptoms, relief of the gradient is associated with substantial improvement in HF symptoms and normal longevity. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Heart failure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HCM is associated with an age-related increase in the prevalence of supraventricular arrhythmias, particularly atrial fibrillation.
