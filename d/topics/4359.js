Our patients' persistent attraction to CAM therapies also reminds us that we still need to identify causes and cures for the rheumatic diseases.</p><p>The clinician's response to use of complementary and alternative remedies should include education of the patient and maintenance of communication with the patient regarding these issues.</p><p>Despite the substantial interest in these therapies, the author does not consider that anything transformative has emerged from the field of CAM remedies for managing patients with rheumatic diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-remedies-for-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/1-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-22</a>]; rheumatologists not recommending CAM therapies for their patients are not withholding clinically important, useful, or proven interventions or adjunctive therapies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25808175\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Terms for complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) remedies have evolved, and use of the term &quot;integrative&quot; medicine is increasing. Contemporary &quot;complementary and alternative medicine&quot; was formerly simply called &quot;quackery&quot; and was ridiculed. Attitudes of both the public and scientific community have changed over the years, and CAM became an acceptable label, particularly with the establishment of the Office of Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 1992 (despite considerable opposition at that time from the scientific community). The program was first called the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine and subsequently renamed the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-remedies-for-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/1,5,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,21,22</a>].</p><p>&quot;Complementary&quot; and &quot;alternative&quot; have been generally adopted in place of more pejorative terms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-remedies-for-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/1,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,21,22</a>]. The label &quot;integrative&quot; medicine, which is commonly used, is intended to reflect inclusion of evidence-based therapies into conventional practice, regardless of their origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-remedies-for-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. This term is not always applied to therapies with scientific rigor and sometimes portrays them with more euphemism than available data would suggest. A taxonomy for CAM has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-remedies-for-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>This discussion will adhere to convention and use the term &quot;complementary and alternative medicine,&quot; or CAM, because of the wide acceptance of this label, although the author prefers the terms &quot;mainstream&quot; and &quot;nonmainstream&quot; to categorize these therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-remedies-for-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/1,5,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,21,22</a>]. Other terms, such as &quot;unproven remedies,&quot; are also problematic. As examples, there have been &quot;mainstream&quot; routine practices that historically were not supported by evidence or proven safe (eg, tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, certain arthroscopic and back operations, irradiation for acne or ankylosing spondylitis, and iced saline lavage for gastrointestinal bleeding) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-remedies-for-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/1,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,21,22</a>]. Likewise, other therapies are evidence-based but remain eschewed by certain cultures (eg, balneotherapy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-remedies-for-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/1,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,21,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25808744\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND PATTERN OF USE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has broad popularity and appeal; most patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases will consider or use CAM therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-remedies-for-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/3,24-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,24-29</a>]. Surveys of patients followed in private- and university-based rheumatology practices found that approximately two-thirds had used some form of complementary or alternative therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-remedies-for-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/3,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,24</a>]. In the United States, 28 to 94 percent of rheumatic disease patients have been estimated to have tried CAM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-remedies-for-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In a 2011 report, 38 percent of all adults in the United States had used CAM, at a total cost of $34 <span class=\"nowrap\">billion/year</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">$122/person/year,</span> accounting for 1.5 percent of total health expenditures and 11 percent of out-of-pocket expenditures on health care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-remedies-for-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Thus, regardless of the clinician's attitude or &quot;belief&quot; in CAM, clinician familiarity with CAM remedies being used by rheumatologic patients is necessary to care properly for patients and to communicate effectively with patients and colleagues. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of herbal medicine and dietary supplements&quot;, section on 'United States'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of herbal medicine and dietary supplements&quot;, section on 'International'</a>.)</p><p>Survey data have found that CAM users have generally tended to be women who were well educated and economically comfortable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-remedies-for-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. CAM therapies have been used for chronic, as opposed to life-threatening, medical conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-remedies-for-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In particular, CAM therapies were frequently used by patients with rheumatologic conditions such as arthritis, chronic back pain, and other painful musculoskeletal disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-remedies-for-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/3,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,31</a>].</p><p>One large survey noted that, over the course of a year, there were more patient visits to CAM practitioners than to primary care clinicians in the United States, yet a majority of CAM users did not inform their medical doctors of their use of alternative therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-remedies-for-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Additionally, almost 50 percent of CAM users in another study did so without any professional supervision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-remedies-for-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], with patients more likely to choose non-practitioner-based CAM therapy than practitioner-based CAM therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-remedies-for-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>A nationwide telephone survey found that the use of CAM increased with the number of patients' medical conditions and the number of clinician visits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-remedies-for-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Patients who reported poor health had substantially higher rates of use of CAM therapies than those who perceived themselves to be in better health (52 versus 33 percent). Studies of patients with specific rheumatologic conditions such as fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus have found that most CAM users tended to be individuals with longer duration of disease, poorer functional status, and higher levels of pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-remedies-for-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

However, CAM products can be dangerous due to any of several factors, including contaminants, drug interactions, and direct adverse effects.</p><p>Patients have suffered from infections, injections, and adverse effects of contaminants of CAM modalities such as arsenic, lead, mercury, caffeine, analgesics, phenylbutazone, glucocorticoids, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ephedrine-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ephedrine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-remedies-for-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/1,3,36-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,36-40</a>]. Rarely, patients have died due to CAM remedies and their components. Additionally, there are potential interactions between many herbal therapies and conventional medications, some clinically important, that are not always recognized. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of herbal medicine and dietary supplements&quot;, section on 'Herb-drug interactions'</a>.)</p><p>There are also direct adverse effects of certain CAM therapies.

There are also risks from patients not communicating with their rheumatologist or other clinicians about CAM use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-remedies-for-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/1,3,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,42,43</a>].</p><p>Although some have argued that patients should be permitted to try CAM therapies because they are often thought to be at least innocuous, the author's view is that it is irresponsible to use therapies generally not established as acceptably safe and effective by a preponderance of good evidence. The following concerns are relevant:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are documented instances of patients who received therapies other than those promised and who suffered from adverse results, including marrow aplasia, serious infections from contaminants, and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-remedies-for-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/3,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,44,45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients seeking CAM remedies may inappropriately neglect their illness and established therapies proven to be effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-remedies-for-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expenditures on CAM remedies may divert scarce personal and health care resources from more appropriate uses.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25808182\"><span class=\"h1\">SELECTED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE REMEDIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of different complementary and alternative (CAM) modalities are used by patients with rheumatic diseases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F115947\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115947 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-remedies-for-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/2,3,21,22,46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,21,22,46,47</a>].

The medication that is an exception is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minocycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minocycline</a>, and this discussion is not pertinent to diseases known to be due to an active infection, such as septic arthritis due to a bacterial infection such as <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> or certain patients with Lyme disease.</p><p>A suggested rationale for the use of antimicrobials for rheumatic disease is the longstanding attractive, but unproven, hypothesis arguing for a microbial etiology for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus, and perhaps other rheumatic diseases. Antimicrobials might be useful therapeutically if this hypothesis were true. They might also be effective by virtue of mechanisms of action other than being antimicrobial. As examples, they might have antiinflammatory, immunomodulatory, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> antirheumatic effects by perturbing gene expression, immune responses, cells, mediators, pathways, signal transduction and transcription, and other biologic processes, also including the microbiome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-remedies-for-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

Such therapy was considered ineffective for many years. This issue was revisited, however, since later scientific work found that tetracyclines, particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minocycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minocycline</a>, may have significant physiologic effects, including reducing collagenase activity, lessening bone resorption, and perturbing T-cell and neutrophil function. In addition, these drugs were found to be antiproliferative, antiinflammatory, and antiarthritic in animal and possibly human arthritis. Studies documented efficacy of these agents for RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-remedies-for-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>] but not consistently for osteoarthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-remedies-for-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. This is an example of a therapy for RA that was once &quot;complementary&quot; or &quot;alternative&quot; but is now &quot;integrative&quot; or &quot;mainstream&quot; for RA but of no benefit for osteoarthritis.

Symptomatic improvement (standard RA clinical assessments, <span class=\"nowrap\">tender/swollen</span> joint, stiffness, walk time, <span class=\"nowrap\">well-being/global</span> assessments) of fish oil supplementation may be enhanced by limiting the dietary intake of polyunsaturated oils (eg, corn, soybean, safflower, sunflower) to 10 grams or less per day. Although capsules of fish oil are convenient, the amount of omega-3 contained in each capsule is equivalent to that found in 1 mL of cod liver oil; thus, a 20 mL dose of cod liver oil, which is the usual daily dose, provides roughly the same amount of such fatty acids as that found in 20 capsules of fish oil.</p><p>Fish oil improved outcomes in patients with recent-onset RA in a randomized &quot;treat-to-target&quot; protocol.

Salient portions of it state:</p><p>&quot;The ACR recognizes the interest in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). The ACR supports rigorous scientific evaluation of all modalities that improve the treatment of rheumatic diseases and recommends continued support of the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health to further research and understanding about CAM. The ACR understands that certain characteristics of some CAMs and some conventional medical interventions make it difficult or impossible to conduct standard randomized controlled trials. For these modalities, innovative methods of evaluation are needed, as are measures and standards for the generation and interpretation of evidence. The ACR supports the integration of those modalities proven to be safe and effective by scientifically rigorous clinical trials published in the biomedical peer review literature. The ACR advises caution in the use of modalities not studied scientifically. The ACR believes health care providers should be informed about the more common CAM modalities and should be able to discuss them knowledgeably with patients.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20123066\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no complementary and alternative remedies that, in the author's judgment, have been proven to have a clinically important role in the routine management of patients with rheumatic diseases. (See <a href=\"#H3647527538\" class=\"local\">'Role of CAM remedies in rheumatic disease care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has broad popularity and appeal; most patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases will consider or use CAM therapies, but often do not notify their rheumatologist or other medical clinicians. Clinicians should be familiar with the common CAM remedies available for arthritis and rheumatic disease. This will facilitate effective communication with patients and colleagues. (See <a href=\"#H25808744\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and pattern of use'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Various factors contribute to the appeal of complementary and alternative remedies. These include seeking hope for understanding and a cure for or relief from physical and emotional suffering due to the effects of the medical illness, response to psychosocial distress independent of illness severity, lifestyle choice, difficulty coping with the limitations of contemporary practice, and uncertainty concerning outcomes of illness. (See <a href=\"#H4211729638\" class=\"local\">'Factors driving use'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinician's response to use of complementary and alternative remedies should include education of the patient and the maintenance of communication with the patient regarding these issues. Potential harms of such therapies include certain adverse effects, failure to use accepted effective interventions, and financial cost. (See <a href=\"#H3647527538\" class=\"local\">'Role of CAM remedies in rheumatic disease care'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4211729638\" class=\"local\">'Factors driving use'</a> above and <a href=\"#H25808772\" class=\"local\">'General safety concerns'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are a wide variety of complementary and alternative remedies for rheumatic disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F115947\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115947 \">table 1</a>). Therapies can be separated into those known not to be clinically beneficial (eg, antibiotics, apheresis, copper bracelets, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dimethyl-sulfoxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dimethyl sulfoxide</a> [DMSO], hyperbaric oxygen), those that have not been studied (cetyl myristoleate [CMO], ginger, methylsulfonylmethane [MSM], shark cartilage, and others), those inadequately or incompletely studied (acupuncture, Ayurveda, food and diet, glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, herbal therapies, laser therapy, leeches, magnets, manipulation, photopheresis, <span class=\"nowrap\">prayer/distant</span> healing, pulsed electromagnetic therapy, S-Adenosyl methionine [SAMe], tai chi, venoms, yoga, and zinc), and those now generally accepted as effective and safe (exercise, <span class=\"nowrap\">fish/botanic</span> oils, mind-body therapies, and <span class=\"nowrap\">spa/balneotherapy)</span>.
