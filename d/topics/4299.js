The primary goal of colon cancer screening is to prevent deaths from colon cancer. Screening tests can help identify cancers at an early and potentially curable stage. Screening can also prevent the development of cancer by identifying and treating precancerous abnormal growths that can be removed before they become malignant.</p><p>Adults should undergo colon cancer screening beginning at age 50 or earlier, depending upon their risk of developing colorectal cancer. Several tests are available, each of which has advantages and disadvantages. The optimal screening test depends upon your preferences and your risk of developing colon cancer.</p><p>This article discusses colon cancer risks, available screening tests, and recommendations for screening based upon your risks. There are additional topics about the screening tests themselves (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flexible-sigmoidoscopy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Flexible sigmoidoscopy (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colonoscopy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Colonoscopy (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>), as well as about particular conditions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colon-polyps-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Colon polyps (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=crohn-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Crohn disease (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ulcerative-colitis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Ulcerative colitis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">WHY COLON CANCER SCREENING WORKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most colorectal cancers develop from precancerous polyps. Polyps are growths that arise in the lining of the colon and are visible when the bowel is examined by endoscopy (colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy) or computed tomography (CT) scan (CT colonography [CTC]). There are two types of polyps: adenomatous and hyperplastic. Adenomatous polyps can become cancerous over time; this progression takes at least 10 years in most people.</p><p>Colon cancer screening tests work by detecting polyps or early-stage cancers. If a polyp or cancer is found, it is removed to prevent it from becoming more serious. Regular screening for and removal of polyps reduces your risk of developing colorectal cancer (by up to 90 percent with colonoscopy). Early detection of cancers that are already present in the colon increases the chance of successful treatment and decreases the chance of dying as a result of the cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">COLON CANCER RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several common characteristics increase the risk of colorectal cancer. While each individual risk factor adds some risk, risk can be substantially increased if several are present together.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Factors that increase risk</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family history of colorectal cancer &ndash; Having colorectal cancer in a family member increases your risk of cancer if the family member is a first-degree relative (a parent, brother or sister, or child), if several family members are affected, or if the cancers occurred at an early age (eg, before age 45 years). (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Family history of colorectal cancer'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior colorectal cancer or polyps &ndash; People who have previously had colorectal cancer have an increased risk of developing a new colorectal cancer. People who have had adenomatous polyps before the age of 60 years are also at increased risk for developing colorectal cancer. Screening recommendations for these groups are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colon-polyps-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Colon polyps (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colon-and-rectal-cancer-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Colon and rectal cancer (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increasing age &ndash; Although the average person has a 4.5 percent lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer, 90 percent of these cancers occur in people older than 50 years of age. Risk increases with age throughout life.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lifestyle factors &ndash; Several lifestyle factors increase the risk of colorectal cancer, including:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A diet high in fat and red or processed meat and low in fiber</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A sedentary lifestyle</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cigarette smoking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Alcohol use</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Obesity</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Large increase in risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some conditions greatly increase the risk of colorectal cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Familial adenomatous polyposis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an uncommon inherited condition. Nearly 100 percent of people with this condition will develop colorectal cancer during their lifetime, and most of these cancers occur before the age of 50 years. FAP causes hundreds of polyps to develop throughout the colon beginning in adolescence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-familial-adenomatous-polyposis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC, also called Lynch syndrome) is another inherited condition associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. It is slightly more common than FAP but is still uncommon, accounting for less than 1 in 20 cases of colorectal cancer. About 70 percent of people with HNPCC will experience colorectal cancer by the age of 65. Cancer also tends to occur at younger ages. People with HNPCC are also at risk for other types of cancer, including cancer of the uterus, stomach, bladder, kidney, and ovary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are other rarer inherited conditions that increase risk of colorectal cancer, including mutY DNA glycosylase <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene&amp;token=oQ8E4y6ta64STPN5P7dGWaOoVHb2RTWeY1twogDATNYIgP71u4Q5P7t3yx4lGhGX&amp;TOPIC_ID=16186\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">gene</a> (MUTYH)-associated polyposis, hamartomatous polyposis, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, and juvenile polyposis syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Inflammatory bowel disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with Crohn disease of the colon or ulcerative colitis have an increased risk of colorectal cancer. The amount of increased risk depends upon the amount of inflamed colon and the duration of disease; pancolitis (inflammation of the entire colon) and colitis of 10 years' duration or longer are associated with the greatest risk for colorectal cancer. The risk of colon cancer is not increased in people with irritable bowel disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1683261246\"><span class=\"h2\">Factors that may decrease risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aspirin, and related nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications, may decrease the risk of developing colorectal cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-in-the-primary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">COLON CANCER SCREENING TESTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several tests available for colorectal cancer screening can detect precancerous polyps (adenomas) and can lead to cancer prevention <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> detect cancers at an early, more treatable stage.</p><p>Guidelines from expert groups recommend that you and your health care provider discuss the available options and choose a testing strategy that makes sense for you. Some experts believe that tests that detect precancerous polyps are preferable, particularly colonoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colon-and-rectal-cancer-screening-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Other experts believe that <em>being</em> screened (with any of the available tests, including stool tests that detect blood) is more important than the particular test that is chosen for the screening.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Colonoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Colonoscopy allows a clinician to see the lining of the rectum and the entire colon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F58531\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58531 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colonoscopy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Colonoscopy (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Procedure &ndash; Colonoscopy requires that you prepare by cleaning out your entire colon and rectum. This usually involves consuming a liquid medication that causes temporary diarrhea. You are usually given a mild sedative drug before the procedure. During colonoscopy, a thin, lighted tube is used to directly view the lining of the rectum and the entire colon. Biopsies (small samples of tissue) can be taken during the procedure. Polyps and some cancers can be removed during this procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Effectiveness &ndash; Colonoscopy detects most small polyps and almost all large polyps and cancers and substantially reduces the risk of developing and dying from colorectal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colon-and-rectal-cancer-screening-beyond-the-basics/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risks and disadvantages &ndash; The risks of colonoscopy, while small, are greater than those of other screening tests. Colonoscopy may lead to serious bleeding or a tear of the intestinal wall in some individuals (about 1 in 1,000). Because the procedure usually requires sedation, you must be accompanied home after the procedure and you should not return to work or other activities on the same day.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Sigmoidoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sigmoidoscopy allows a clinician to directly view the lining of the rectum and the lower part of the colon (the descending colon) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F58531\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58531 \">figure 1</a>). This area accounts for about one-half of the total area of the rectum and colon. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flexible-sigmoidoscopy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Flexible sigmoidoscopy (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Procedure &ndash; Sigmoidoscopy requires that you prepare by cleaning out the lower bowel. This usually involves consuming a clear liquid diet and using an enema shortly before the examination. Most people do not need sedative drugs and are able to return to work or other activities the same day. During the procedure, a thin, lighted tube is advanced into the rectum and through the left side of the colon to check for polyps and cancer; the procedure may cause mild cramping. Biopsies (small samples of tissue) can be taken during sigmoidoscopy. Sigmoidoscopy may be performed in a doctor's office.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Effectiveness &ndash; Sigmoidoscopy can identify polyps and cancers in the descending colon and rectum with a high degree of accuracy. Studies have shown that sigmoidoscopy reduces the incidence of colorectal cancer and overall mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colon-and-rectal-cancer-screening-beyond-the-basics/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risks and disadvantages &ndash; The risks of sigmoidoscopy are small. The procedure could create a small tear in the intestinal wall in about 2 per every 10,000 people; death from this complication is rare. A major disadvantage of sigmoidoscopy is that it cannot detect polyps or cancers that are located only in the right side (eg, the cecum or ascending colon to the hepatic flexure) or in the transverse colon, which are more common in older women.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional testing &ndash; Having polyps or cancers in the lower colon increases the likelihood that there are polyps or cancer in the remaining part of the colon. Thus, if sigmoidoscopy reveals polyps or cancer, colonoscopy is recommended to view the entire length of the colon.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4053849\"><span class=\"h2\">CT colonography (&quot;virtual colonoscopy&quot;)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Computed tomography colonography (CTC, sometimes called &quot;virtual colonoscopy&quot;) is a test that uses a CT scanner to take images of the entire bowel. These images are two- and three-dimensional and are reconstructed to allow a radiologist to determine if polyps or cancers are present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F72330\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72330 \">picture 1</a>). The major advantages of CTC are that it does not require sedation, it is noninvasive, the entire bowel can be examined, and abnormal areas (adenomas) can be detected about as well as with traditional (optical) colonoscopy.</p><p>There are several disadvantages of CTC. Like traditional colonoscopy, CTC usually requires a bowel prep to clean out the colon. If an abnormal area is found with CTC, a traditional colonoscopy will be needed to see the area and take a tissue sample (biopsy). CTC may detect abnormalities other than polyps or cancer in the <span class=\"nowrap\">colon/rectum</span>. Many of these incidental findings will require further testing that could lead to harm. CTC may not be covered by health insurance plans in the United States. CTC, like many other imaging tests, exposes patients to radiation which may have long-term risks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Stool tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Colorectal cancers often release microscopic amounts of blood and abnormal DNA into the stool. Stool tests can detect blood or abnormal DNA markers.</p><p>Two types of tests, called guaiac tests (Hemoccult SENSA) and immunochemical tests, evaluate the stool for blood, which may be present if there is bleeding from a colon cancer (or other source of blood).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With guaiac testing, you collect two samples of stool from three consecutive bowel movements, which you apply to home collection cards. You mail the cards back according to the instructions. You should avoid drugs that irritate the stomach, such as aspirin and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), before collecting the stool.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With immunochemical testing, you use a long-handled tool to collect the specimen according to the manufacturer's instructions. You apply the brush to a kit and then mail the kit back according to instructions. You do not have to change your diet or stop any medications with this test. Immunochemical testing is more convenient and somewhat better able to find cancer than guaiac testing, but the test kit is a bit more expensive.</p><p/><p>Stool testing for blood, when performed once per year, reduces the risk of dying from colorectal cancer by one-third or more [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colon-and-rectal-cancer-screening-beyond-the-basics/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, because polyps seldom bleed, stool testing for blood is less likely to detect polyps than other screening tests. In addition, only 2 to 5 percent of people with a positive stool test actually have colorectal cancer. If the stool test is positive, your entire colon should be examined with colonoscopy.</p><p>A DNA test is another option and is done every three years. This test looks for specific DNA markers that may signify the presence of a colon cancer, and it also looks for blood in the stool. For this test, you get a special kit in order to collect a whole bowel movement. Then you follow the instructions about how and where to ship it. An abnormal test should be followed up by colonoscopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Fecal occult blood test and sigmoidoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Combined screening with a fecal immunochemical test and sigmoidoscopy is a possible screening strategy and may be more effective than either test done alone. The sensitive fecal occult blood test can be used in place of the immunochemical test if necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">COLON CANCER SCREENING PLANS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The colon cancer screening plan that is right for you depends upon your risk of colorectal cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Average risk of colorectal cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with an average risk of colorectal cancer should begin screening at age 50.
