Most new cases of syphilis are sexually acquired. The clinical manifestations depend upon the stage of disease. Studies performed in the pre-antibiotic era permit a relatively complete understanding of the natural history of untreated syphilis. Information about the natural history of untreated syphilis in humans derives from data collected from several sources:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the late 19th century, a Norwegian physician described the evolution of infection in more than 1400 patients with primary and secondary syphilis. Because he believed that the available therapies at the time were highly toxic and of little benefit, patients received no treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional data were collected from a study of 382 adults with syphilis who underwent autopsies between 1917 and 1941 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

It is a bacterium from the order Spirochaetales and is one of several closely related treponemes which cause human disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. <em>T. pallidum</em> is approximately 10 to 13 microns long but only 0.15 microns in width, making it too slender to be visualized by direct microscopy. This feature greatly complicates diagnosis.</p><p>The organism can be seen with darkfield microscopy, a technique that employs a special condenser that casts an oblique light. When visualized by this method, <em>T. pallidum</em> is a delicate, corkscrew-shaped organism with tightly wound spirals (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F56211\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56211 \">picture 1</a>). It exhibits a characteristic rotary motion with flexing and back-and-forth movement, features considered sufficiently characteristic to be diagnostic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H947750714\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Worldwide </strong>&ndash; The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that worldwide in 2012, there were 18 million prevalent cases of syphilis in adolescents and adults aged 15 to 49, and 5.6 million new cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The global incidence rate was 1.5 cases per 1000 females and 1.5 cases per 1000 males. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The highest prevalence was reported in the WHO African region, followed by the South-East Asian region, and the Western Pacific region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In the Western Pacific region, the highest incidence of syphilis cases in 2012 were reported in Mongolia and Fiji (approximately 180 and 80 per 100,000 population, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In China, a national surveillance program demonstrated that after the virtual eradication of syphilis from the 1960s to the 1980s, syphilis has re-emerged with a total of 171,026 primary and secondary syphilis cases reported in 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>United States</strong> &ndash; In the United States, syphilis has been a nationally notifiable disease since 1944. Its unique laboratory diagnostic features ensure that most cases are reported. Thus, there are relatively accurate statistics on the incidence of new infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was a mini epidemic of early syphilis that produced case rates that were higher than at any time since the introduction of penicillin in 1943. The number of cases peaked in 1990 (20.3 cases per 100,000 population) but subsequently fell to a new nadir in 2000, raising hopes for eradication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, the number of cases of primary and secondary syphilis increased again in 2001, and the rate has continued to climb almost every year since that time. As an example, 8724 cases were reported in 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. From 2011 to 2015, there was a 67 percent increase nationwide in primary and secondary syphilis rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. By 2016, the overall number of reported primary and secondary syphilis cases was 27,814, which is the highest rate reported since 1993 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">From 2000 to 2016, the rise in the rate of reported syphilis cases is primarily attributable to increased cases among men who have sex with men (MSM). Approximately 90 percent of primary and secondary syphilis cases occur in men, and among those in which there was information about sex partners, 81 percent occurred in MSM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Among MSM with syphilis, risk factors for acquisition include methamphetamine use and having acquired recent sexual partners from the internet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">From 2013 to 2016, primary and secondary syphilis rates also increased among women. Of particular concern, is the uptick in cases of congenital syphilis that is also being seen, with 15.7 cases per 100,000 live births reported in 2016 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Available data from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggest that approximately 50 percent of MSM with primary and secondary syphilis are HIV infected, compared with 10 percent of men who have sex with women and 3.9 percent of women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syphilis-in-the-hiv-infected-patient#H402717952\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syphilis in the HIV-infected patient&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In men, the highest rates of primary and secondary syphilis in 2016 were&nbsp;observed among men in the West (eg, San Francisco County), black men, and men aged 20 to 34 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. When ranked according to age, the rate was highest in those aged 25 to 29 years, at 48.5 per 100,000 population. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The rate of reported primary and secondary syphilis cases remains highest among the black population, with the overall rate of syphilis being highest in black men. As an example, in 2016, the rate of reported cases per 100,000 population was 41.0 in black men, 19.7 in Hispanic men, and 9.0 in white men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Among women, the reported primary and secondary syphilis rates ranged from 0.<span class=\"nowrap\">8/100,000</span> in 2005 to 1.5 in 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/13,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,19</a>]. In 2016, the rate among women was 1.9 cases per 100,000 females, which increased by approximately 36 percent compared with 2015; the largest increase was in the West (60 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The rate was highest in black women (6.3 per 100,000 population) compared with Hispanic and white women (1.9 and 0.9, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Late syphilis occurs in an uncertain proportion of patients infected by <em>T. pallidum </em>due to the lack of reliable systems for reporting late stages of the disease. However, there has also been an upward trend in late and late latent syphilis since 2009, with the CDC reporting 5.6 cases per 100,000 in 2009 and 9.5 cases per 100,000 in 2016 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This may be due in part to the resurgence in early syphilis that occurred in the United States in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Implementation of the reverse sequence screening method (ie, an initial treponemal test followed by a confirmatory nontreponemal test) in many labs across the country may also contribute to this upward trend in late and late latent syphilis cases. The reverse approach detects cases of late and late latent syphilis in patients whose nontreponemal test has become nonreactive over time. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syphilis-screening-and-diagnostic-testing#H3314277445\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syphilis: Screening and diagnostic testing&quot;, section on 'Serologic testing algorithms'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The increase in syphilis cases has prompted the CDC to issue a national Call to Action. This is aimed at increasing efforts to detect and treat syphilis, and thereby improve patient outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

In addition, <em>T. pallidum</em> readily crosses the placenta, thereby resulting in fetal infection. The acquisition of syphilis through transfused blood is very rare because all donors are screened and <em>T. pallidum</em> cannot survive longer than 24 to 48 hours under blood bank storage conditions. Additional discussions of syphilis transmission during pregnancy and through blood donations are found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syphilis-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syphilis in pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-syphilis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H110903715\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital syphilis: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Transmission'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood donor screening: Laboratory testing&quot;, section on 'Syphilis'</a>.) </p><p>Sexual transmission requires exposure to open lesions with organisms present, features seen with the primary chancre and with some of the manifestations of secondary syphilis (mucous patches and condyloma lata). These lesions are very infectious, with an efficiency of transmission estimated at approximately 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/3,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,20</a>]. In contrast, the cutaneous lesions of secondary syphilis contain few treponemes, and the risk of transmission through intact skin is low. Patients with early latent syphilis are considered infectious due to lesions that were recently active, but are no longer present, or were missed on the initial evaluation.</p><p><em>T. pallidum</em> can initiate infection wherever inoculation occurs. Thus, contact of infected secretions with almost any tissue can lead to a primary syphilis lesion at that site, and syphilis can be spread by kissing or touching a person who has active lesions on the lips, oral cavity, breasts, or genitals. As an example, transmission of syphilis has been identified in men who have sex with men (MSM) who have reported oral sex as their only risk factor for acquisition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>Syphilis is also associated with the transmission and acquisition of other sexually transmitted infections (eg, HIV). As an example, in a study examining the HIV incidence among men with new primary and secondary syphilis, 1 in 20 MSM were diagnosed with HIV within one year of a syphilis diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Thus, knowledge of the growth characteristics and metabolism of this bacterium are quite limited. Data in animal models and human volunteers form the basis of most of the available information on this pathogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/5,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,23</a>]. The pathogenesis of neurosyphilis is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurosyphilis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurosyphilis&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H971441526\"><span class=\"h2\">Early local infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>T. pallidum</em> initiates infection when it gains access to subcutaneous tissues via microscopic abrasions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Despite a slow estimated dividing time of 30 hours, the spirochete evades early host immune responses and establishes the initial ulcerative lesion, the chancre (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F75291\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75291 \">picture 2</a>). During the period of early local replication, some organisms establish infection in regional draining lymph nodes, with subsequent dissemination. </p><p><em>T. pallidum</em> elicits innate and adaptive cellular immune responses in skin and blood. The host immune response begins with lesional infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, which are soon replaced by T lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In one study of 23 patients with secondary syphilis, leukocytes were obtained from syphilitic lesions and peripheral blood mononuclear cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Compared with peripheral blood, lesional fluids were enriched with CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, activated monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Many of these dendritic cells also expressed HIV coreceptors (eg, CCR5 and DC-SIGN), which may help explain the epidemiologic link between syphilis and HIV transmission. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=factors-affecting-hiv-progression#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Factors affecting HIV progression&quot;, section on 'Coreceptor usage'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syphilis-in-the-hiv-infected-patient#H402717952\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syphilis in the HIV-infected patient&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>After acquisition on <em>T. pallidum</em>, humoral immune responses are also generated. This leads to the development of a variety of antibodies that can be detected relatively early in the course of syphilis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syphilis-screening-and-diagnostic-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syphilis: Screening and diagnostic testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In some respects, the immune response to <em>T. pallidum</em> is paradoxical. On one hand, the various immune responses during early infection appear to be efficacious, since they coincide with resolution of the primary chancre, even in the absence of therapy. However, despite this apparent immune control, widespread dissemination of spirochetes occurs at the same time, leading to subsequent clinical manifestations of secondary or tertiary syphilis in untreated patients. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H971441534\"><span class=\"h2\">Late infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cellular immunity is important for control of syphilis in experimental infection and probably contributes to the pathogenesis of late syphilis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The prolonged latent period that is characteristic of most types of late syphilis suggests that immune mechanisms may be involved in one of two ways. Waning immunity with aging may facilitate recrudescence of a small number of treponemes that had survived in sequestered sites. Alternatively, a partially immune hypersensitive host may react to the presence of treponemes, engendering a chronic inflammatory response.</p><p>Gummas, or late benign syphilis often involving the skin, viscera, or other tissues (eg, bone, brain, abdominal viscera), are characterized pathologically by the presence of granulomas, a finding that is consistent with a cellular hypersensitivity reaction (see <a href=\"#H2244594218\" class=\"local\">'Gummatous syphilis'</a> below). Experimental studies with human subjects who were inoculated cutaneously with small numbers of live <em>T. pallidum</em> found that gummas developed only in those who had previous syphilis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. This suggests that development of gummas requires an immune response insufficient to be protective, but substantial enough to cause tissue damage and granuloma formation in the reinfected host.</p><p>Cardiovascular syphilis with involvement of the ascending arch of the aorta and aortic valve is a consequence of vasculitis of the vasa vasorum (&quot;endarteritis obliterans&quot;). Small vessel vasculitis is a common manifestation of secondary and later stages of syphilis as evidenced by the presence of lymphocytes and plasma cells infiltrating blood vessels and perivascular tissues. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3638352602\"><span class=\"h1\">STAGES OF DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with syphilis can present with a wide range of symptoms depending upon the stage of disease.

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p>The lesion begins as a papule, which is typically (but not always) painless, appearing at the site of inoculation. This soon ulcerates to produce the classic chancre of primary syphilis, a 1 to 2 centimeter ulcer with a raised, indurated margin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F75291\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75291 \">picture 2</a>). The ulcer generally has a non-exudative base and is associated with mild to moderate regional lymphadenopathy that is often bilateral. Such lesions usually occur on the genitalia, but occasionally patients may develop chancres at other sites of inoculation. These sites may include areas that may not be noticeable to the patient, including the posterior pharynx, anus, or vagina. Infrequently, multiple chancres occur, particularly in the setting of HIV infection.
