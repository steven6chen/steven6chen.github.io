Most commonly it occurs when flying or traveling up a mountain, and a full sensation develops in the ears, leading to the feeling of wanting to pop the ears open in order to hear better. Diminished hearing also may occur during an ear infection. These causes of hearing loss are usually short-lived. The other extreme is the permanent sensorineural hearing loss that occurs with aging, which most people experience to some degree [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-hearing-loss-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The evaluation of hearing loss in adults will be reviewed here. The etiology and treatment of hearing loss are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-hearing-loss-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of hearing loss in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hearing-amplification-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hearing amplification in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION OF HEARING LOSS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hearing loss may be classified into three types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-hearing-loss-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sensorineural, involving the inner ear, cochlea, or the auditory nerve.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conductive, involving any cause that in some way limits the amount of external sound from gaining access to the inner ear. Examples include cerumen impaction, middle ear fluid, or ossicular chain fixation (lack of movement of the small bones of the ear).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mixed loss, which is a combination of conductive and sensorineural hearing loss.</p><p/><p>A number of abnormalities may lead to hearing loss of each type (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53903\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53903 \">table 1</a>). It is useful to begin the evaluation by classifying the loss as sensorineural or conductive, since this helps focus the remainder of the patient assessment. Conductive hearing loss is usually related to abnormalities of the outer or middle ear; sensorineural hearing loss is related to inner ear pathology.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any patient complaining of hearing loss should have a full auditory history and examination performed. Important questions in the history include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What was the onset and progression of the hearing loss?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How well can the patient understand spoken words?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the problem mainly with background noise (eg restaurants, parties) or is it just as bad in quiet settings?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there pain or drainage out of the ear associated with the hearing loss?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there a history of significant trauma, including noise and barotrauma?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there a history of major infections?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there a history of previous ear surgery?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there associated tinnitus, vertigo, or disequilibrium?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there a family history of hearing loss? There are a number of congenital and hereditary causes of hearing loss; presbycusis also can run in families.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What medications are taken?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do headaches or visual disturbances occur before, during, or after episodes of hearing loss?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What medications, including over-the-counter drugs, is the patient taking?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of other medical disorders such as diabetes, smoking, coronary artery disease, autoimmune diseases.</p><p/><p>Patients with sudden hearing loss require urgent referral as treatment success is related to early initiation of treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sudden sensorineural hearing loss&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The examination for some patients will involve only simple tests that can be performed in a primary care office. Many patients, however, will require formal audiologic testing or other specialized tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Office hearing evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a variety of methods used to test hearing in the office setting. These include a whispered voice test, tone-emitting otoscope, questionnaires, and tuning forks.</p><p>A systematic review of the whispered voice test concluded that in four studies in adults the sensitivity for hearing impairment was 90 to 100 percent and the specificity was 70 to 87 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-hearing-loss-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. To perform a whispered voice test, stand at arm's length behind the patient (to prevent lip reading) and mask hearing in one ear by occluding the ear canal and rubbing the tragus with a circular motion. Whisper a short sequence of letters and numbers and ask the patient to repeat them. Test the other ear in a similar manner.</p><p>In addition to the whispered voice test, tone-emitting otoscopes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> questionnaires are often used. In a randomized trial of screening strategies in 2305 veterans (mean age 61 years), fewer patients evaluated with a tone-emitting otoscope screened positive (19 percent versus 59 and 64 percent of patients evaluated with questionnaire and dual screening [questionnaire and otoscope], respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-hearing-loss-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Hearing aid use one year after screening was 6 percent in the tone-emitting otoscope group compared with 4 and 7 percent in the questionnaire and dual screening groups, respectively. Screening with the tone-emitting otoscope was the most efficient screening method, as the questionnaire led to unnecessary audiology evaluations with little added benefit in terms of hearing loss detection.</p><p>Hearing status can be further assessed with tuning forks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-hearing-loss-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Patients who cannot hear a 256 Hz tuning fork but can hear a 512 Hz tuning fork have a hearing loss of approximately 10 to 15 dB; patients who cannot hear a 512 Hz tuning fork have an approximate loss of at least 20 to 30 dB. An ear that hears normally should have air conduction (sound waves traveling to the tympanic membrane and converted into sound in the inner ear) that is louder than bone conduction (sound transmitted via the vibration of the skull into the cochlea). The Weber and Rinne tests examine the relative adequacy of air and bone conduction of sound.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Weber and Rinne tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Weber and Rinne tests can help direct the remainder of the evaluation, but should not be used as screening evaluations for hearing loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-hearing-loss-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Weber test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Weber tuning fork test is performed by pressing the handle of the tuning fork to the bridge of the forehead, nose, or teeth and asking the patient if the sound is louder in one ear or the other. The sound is heard equally in both ears in patients with normal hearing or symmetric hearing loss.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Rinne test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Rinne test allows comparison of sound when the tuning fork is placed on the mastoid bone behind the ear (bone conduction), versus when the tuning fork is held near the ear (air conduction) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-hearing-loss-in-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. An abnormal result occurs when sound is at least equally loud or louder when the fork is placed on bone as compared with when it is held next to the ear (bone&gt;air conduction). The Rinne test is considered normal when the vibrating fork placed near the ear is louder than when placed on the mastoid bone (air&gt;bone conduction).</p><p>One method for performing the Rinne test is to press the handle of the tuning fork to the mastoid bone and ask the patient to tell the examiner when the sound is no longer audible. At that point, the vibrating end of the tuning fork is placed near the external auditory canal (EAC). If the patient can again hear the tuning fork, the Rinne test is normal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Interpretation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Weber and Rinne tests can then be used to help distinguish conductive from sensorineural hearing loss (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F74212\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74212 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58032\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58032 \">figure 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients complaining of a unilateral decrease in hearing, the Weber test suggests sensorineural hearing loss if the sound lateralizes (is louder on) to the &quot;good&quot; side; conductive hearing loss is suspected if the sound lateralizes to the &quot;bad&quot; side.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An abnormal Rinne test, with bone&gt;air conduction, is consistent with conductive loss, particularly if the Weber test also lateralizes to that side.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the Weber test lateralizes to an ear in which the Rinne is normal, the Rinne test in the opposite ear should be performed. A normal Rinne test in the contralateral ear suggests sensorineural hearing loss in this contralateral ear (ie, the Weber lateralized to the normal ear). An audiogram is indicated in this situation.</p><p/><p>The Weber test may be unreliable in some settings. In one study of 250 patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) confirmed by audiometry, the Weber test correctly identified sensorineural hearing loss in the affected ear in 78 percent; the Weber test did not lateralize in 21 percent (heard midline or not heard at all), and incorrectly lateralized in just 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-hearing-loss-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. These results suggest that in the setting of sudden hearing loss, further evaluation for SSNHL is required when the Weber test does not lateralize. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sudden sensorineural hearing loss&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Conductive hearing loss on one side is indicative of external or middle ear disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53903\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53903 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-hearing-loss-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of hearing loss in adults&quot;, section on 'Outer ear causes'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-hearing-loss-in-adults#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of hearing loss in adults&quot;, section on 'Middle ear causes'</a>.)</p><p>Gradual sensorineural hearing loss on one side suggests an inner ear disorder such as Meniere disease or a vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma). If confirmed by audiometry, the patient with progressive asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss that is not clearly attributed to Meniere disease should have an MRI or CT scan of the posterior fossa and internal auditory canal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meniere-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Meniere disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Examination of the ear</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with conductive hearing loss should have an examination of the auricle and EAC performed to look for blockage of the EAC. The tympanic membrane (TM) should be viewed to ensure that there is no middle ear abnormality such as fluid or TM perforations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Pneumoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pneumoscopy is also performed to evaluate mobility of the TM. Positive pressure that forces air into the EAC thereby pushing down the TM, is done first. The pressure is then released, with the subsequent negative pressure pulling the TM outwards.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A nonmobile TM may occur because of fluid in the middle ear cavity, a mass in the middle ear cavity, or a stiff or sclerotic TM.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A hypermobile TM may indicate ossicular chain disruption.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The TM may only move with negative pressure; this can be caused by retraction of the TM or middle ear with a blocked eustachian tube, resulting in negative middle ear pressure.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Formal audiologic assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients without an obvious etiology for hearing loss (such as external otitis or cerumen impaction) should undergo formal audiologic testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-hearing-loss-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Formal audiologic assessment is performed by an audiologist in a soundproof environment. This evaluation provides very accurate and detailed information regarding a patient's hearing ability. The formal audiogram, with tympanogram and site of lesion testing, provides definitive information. Every audiologic workup should consist of a number of audiometric studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-hearing-loss-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Pure tone, air, and bone conduction testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pure tone testing is commonly known as the audiogram. The patient is in a soundproof booth, and the audiologist assesses the sensitivity or ability to hear pure tone stimuli at the frequencies of 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, and 8000 hz. The threshold for each stimulus is determined by finding the dB level at which the patient can detect the tone 50 percent of the time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-hearing-loss-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Hearing is tested with both air and bone conduction. Air conduction tests the ability to hear with ear phones via the normal mechanism of hearing: sound through the EAC, TM, and then middle ear system. Bone conduction is tested with a bone oscillator. The oscillator is placed on either mastoid and held in place, stimulating noise going into the skull and bypassing the middle ears by setting the fluid and cochlea in motion directly with bone vibration. Any difference between air and bone conduction thresholds is known as an <span class=\"nowrap\">air/bone</span> gap; a gap is consistent with conductive hearing loss (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59939\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59939 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Speech audiometry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Speech audiometry typically consists of two parts: the speech reception threshold (SRT) and the word discrimination score.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The SRT is the softest level at which a patient can correctly repeat 50 percent of presented spondee words. Spondee words are two-syllable words where each syllable is stressed, such as airplane, armchair, or pancake. SRT is recorded in decibels and serves as a cross-check for the pure tone air conduction thresholds. The SRT is typically equal to the pure tone air conduction average, &plusmn; 6 dB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-hearing-loss-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The pure tone average is the average decibel score at 500, 1000, and 2000 hz.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The word discrimination score is the percentage of phonetically balanced words that a patient can correctly repeat at a given sensation level. Typically, testing is performed at 40 dB above the patient's SRT. This discrimination score serves two purposes: it can establish the prognosis for the use of a hearing aid, and it helps determine the site of the lesion. A poor discrimination score usually indicates significant neural degeneration; these individuals may not be good candidates for hearing aids, since the aid will amplify sound but may not allow the patient to understand what is being said.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Impedance audiometry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Impedance audiometry is performed in two parts: tympanometry and stapedial reflex testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-hearing-loss-in-adults/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. The first component is tympanometry, which is the hard-copy version of pneumoscopy performed in the office. It is an objective measure of the changes in the acoustic impedance of the middle ear system in response to changes in air pressure. As the pressure increases during pneumoscopy, the eardrum is pushed medially; as negative pressure is placed, the eardrum protrudes laterally. The point of maximum compliance of the middle ear is identified; this indicates the current status of the air pressure in the middle ear.</p><p>Five types of tympanograms can be seen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F73425\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73425 \">figure 3</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal middle ear pressure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Little or no mobility, suggestive of fluid behind the TM</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Negative pressure in the middle ear suggestive of a retracted TM</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type AS, a very stiff middle ear system that may be due to myringosclerosis or otosclerosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type AD, the high compliant TM normally seen in ossicular chain discontinuity.</p><p/><p>Stapedial reflex testing may also be performed. Further discussion of this test is beyond the scope of this review.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Other tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Various metabolic abnormalities have been known to either cause or be associated with sensorineural hearing loss. Thus, an evaluation of an unexplained sensorineural hearing loss should involve a complete laboratory evaluation to include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measurement of blood sugar; small vessel disease as a result of diabetic vasculopathy can cause cochlear ischemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete blood count with differential; anemia or a white blood cell dyscrasia may lead to sensorineural hearing loss by an unknown mechanism that may involve decreased oxygenation, microblockage of vessels, or infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thyroid stimulating hormone to rule out hyper or hypothyroidism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serologic test for syphilis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serologic tests for Sjogren's syndrome (ANA, RF, anti-Ro and anti-La) in patients who have dry eyes or dry mouth.
