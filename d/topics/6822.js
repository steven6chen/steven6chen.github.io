In a survey of 6596 adults ages 60 years and older, 14.3 percent reported significant hip pain on most days over the past six weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-hip-pain/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Trochanteric and gluteus medius bursitis, osteoarthritis, and fractures of the femur are the most common conditions affecting the hip. The character and location of the pain, the movement and positions that reproduce the pain, and the affect on ambulation can be used to distinguish the conditions affecting soft tissues from disorders affecting the hip joint and adjacent bones.</p><p>This review will provide a general approach to the evaluation of patients with hip pain. More in-depth discussions of the diagnosis and treatment of specific disorders of the hip are found separately. The diagnostic approach to hip pain in children is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-hip-pain-in-childhood\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to hip pain in childhood&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hip joint is formed by the rounded head of the femur and its articulation with the acetabulum. The latter is formed by the union of the ilium, ischium, and pubis. The hip joint is a ball-and-socket joint that is relatively fixed to the body by the pelvic girdle. Because of this relative immobility, a primary abnormality of the hip or pelvis can cause symptoms in the lumbar spine or knee, and a primary abnormality in the lumbar spine or knee may cause a secondary abnormality in the hip [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-hip-pain/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The femoral neck is approximately 8 to 10 cm in length. Two bony prominences project from the femoral neck: the greater trochanter laterally and the lesser trochanter medially. The greater trochanter is the site of attachment for the abductor muscles (gluteus medius and gluteus minimus) and the external rotators of the hip. The main hip extensors are gluteus maximus and the hamstrings; the former attaches to the proximal femur, just distal to the greater trochanter. The lesser trochanter is the attachment site for the major hip flexor, the iliopsoas muscle.</p><p>The major blood supply to the head and neck of the femur is usually the medial femoral circumflex artery, a branch of the common femoral artery. Fracture of the femoral neck can disrupt the blood supply and result in osteonecrosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteonecrosis (avascular necrosis of bone)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are approximately 18 bursae in the hip region. The deep trochanteric bursa (also referred to as the gluteus medius bursa) lies between the tendon of the gluteus maximus and the posterolateral prominence of the greater trochanter and is a common source of inflammation and hip pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-hip-pain/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A more superficial bursa directly over the greater trochanter may also become inflamed and tender (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F60606\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60606 \">figure 1</a>). Other bursa that can become a source of hip pathology include the iliopsoas bursa, located between the psoas tendon and the hip capsule, and the ischiogluteal bursa, located between the gluteus maximus muscle and the ischial tuberosity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY AND PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain is the most common complaint in patients with hip problems. In most cases, a careful history and physical examination can determine the etiology.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain patterns</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The character and location of pain is the key element in the differential diagnosis of hip pain. Increased pain with or after use (particularly with weight-bearing) and improvement with rest is the hallmark of a structural joint problem, particularly osteoarthritis. By comparison, constant pain, especially pain at night, suggests an infectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic process.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Lateral hip pain aggravated by direct pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lateral hip pain is unlikely to be due to hip joint disease. Lateral hip pain that is aggravated by direct pressure is the classic pattern of trochanteric bursitis. Depending upon the degree of inflammation and swelling, pressure sensitivity ranges from mild morning pain and stiffness to intolerance to sleeping on the affected side.</p><p>Progressive lateral hip pain that is aggravated by direct pressure and weight bearing can also be seen with direct involvement of the femur (eg, with metastatic cancer). Thus, patients who otherwise may be at risk for malignancy (eg, older individuals with weight loss, history of cancer) may need radiographic testing to rule out bone involvement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Lateral hip pain associated with paresthesias and hypesthesias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lateral hip pain accompanied by paresthesias or hypesthesias is the classic presentation of meralgia paresthetica (lateral femoral cutaneous nerve entrapment). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meralgia-paresthetica-lateral-femoral-cutaneous-nerve-entrapment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Meralgia paresthetica (lateral femoral cutaneous nerve entrapment)&quot;</a>.) Meralgia paresthetica is characterized by a localized area of pain (often described as a burning or an uncomfortable, heightened sensation) that is not influenced by direct pressure, hip movement, or lower back movement. In contrast, lumbar radiculopathy, particularly involving L4-5, causes lateral hip pain that extends over a much wider area, radiating down the leg and into the foot, with or without associated foot numbness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute lumbosacral radiculopathy: Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Anterior hip or groin pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anterior hip or groin pain suggests primary involvement of the hip joint itself. A gradual onset of pain in association with variable degrees of impaired movement is consistent with osteoarthritis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of osteoarthritis&quot;</a>.) The differential diagnosis of acute onset of groin pain and impairment of weight bearing includes osteonecrosis (particularly in the setting of risk factors such as glucocorticoid use), occult fracture (eg, following trauma), acute synovitis, or, uncommonly, septic arthritis.</p><p>Anterior hip pain that is neither aggravated by direct pressure nor repetitive flexion of the hip suggests the presence of an inguinal hernia, lower abdominal pathology, or, less commonly, referred pain from higher lumbar spinal nerve roots (eg, L2-3).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Posterior hip pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Posterior (gluteal) hip pain is the least common pain pattern affecting the hip. It is most often a sign of sacroiliac joint disease, lumbar radiculopathy, herpes zoster, or an unusual presentation of the hip joint. Patients with posterior hip pain often undergo extensive examination and radiographic testing of the back and hip in order to define a precise cause.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Lower anterior thigh pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients presenting with lower anterior thigh pain pose the greatest clinical challenge. Primary disease of the hip joint, primary and secondary lesions of the upper femur, stress fracture of the femoral neck, and upper lumbar radiculopathy can refer pain to the lower thigh (or even the anterior knee). Unless the pain can be reproduced by passive rotation (hip joint), by applying torque to the thigh (femur), or by maneuvers designed to elicit radicular symptoms (eg, straight leg raising), most patients with lower anterior thigh pain require specific radiographic procedures to define a precise cause.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Trochanteric bursitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As mentioned, inflammation of the trochanteric bursa is one of the most common causes of hip pain. It is caused by an exaggerated movement of the gluteus medius tendon and the tensor fascia lata over the outer femur. Even subtle gait impairment can increase friction and pressure over the trochanteric process. Common gait abnormalities that may result in trochanteric bursitis include lumbosacral spine stiffness, leg length discrepancy, knee arthritis, and ankle sprain. Untreated, the normally paper thin bursal wall thickens, fibroses, and gradually loses its ability to lubricate the outer hip.</p><p>Patients typically complain of lateral hip pain, with point tenderness over the trochanteric bursa. The point of tenderness usually lies approximately one inch posterior and superior to the greater trochanter, and is located about 7.5 cm deep to the skin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=greater-trochanteric-pain-syndrome-formerly-trochanteric-bursitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (formerly trochanteric bursitis)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Hip osteoarthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Osteoarthritis most commonly presents in patients over 40 years of age. The principal symptom associated with osteoarthritis of the hip is pain, which is typically exacerbated by activity and relieved by rest. With more advanced disease, pain may be noted with progressively less activity, eventually occurring at rest and at night. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of osteoarthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In contrast to the lateral hip pain associated with bursitis, osteoarthritis usually presents with groin pain that is aggravated by movement rather than by direct pressure. Other key clinical features suggestive of osteoarthritis include internal rotation of less than 15 degrees, pain on internal rotation, morning stiffness (less than 30 to 60 minutes), and flexion less than 115 degrees [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-hip-pain/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis#H1959059637\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of osteoarthritis&quot;, section on 'Hip'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Meralgia paresthetica</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, a pure sensory nerve, is susceptible to compression as it courses from the lumbosacral nerve plexus, through the abdominal cavity, under the inguinal ligament, and into the subcutaneous tissue of the thigh. Symptoms range from numbness and tingling (hypesthesia) to burning pain (paresthesia) over the upper outer thigh. Pain referred beyond the upper outer thigh or pain accompanied by impaired reflexes or muscular weakness suggests either trochanteric bursitis or lumbar radiculopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meralgia-paresthetica-lateral-femoral-cutaneous-nerve-entrapment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Meralgia paresthetica (lateral femoral cutaneous nerve entrapment)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Osteonecrosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Osteonecrosis, also known as aseptic necrosis, avascular necrosis, ischemic necrosis, and osteochondritis dissecans, is a pathological process that has been associated with numerous conditions and therapeutic interventions. The mechanisms by which this disorder develops are not fully understood. However, compromise of the bone vasculature leading to the death of bone and marrow cells, and ultimate mechanical failure, appear to be common to most proposed etiologies. The process is most often progressive, resulting in joint destruction within three to five years if left untreated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteonecrosis (avascular necrosis of bone)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A variety of traumatic and nontraumatic factors contribute to the etiology of osteonecrosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F69502\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69502 \">table 1</a>). A definitive etiologic role has been established for some of these factors, but the majority is probable relationships. Corticosteroid use and excessive alcohol intake are reported to account for more than 90 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-hip-pain/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The most common presenting symptom of osteonecrosis is pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-hip-pain/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Groin pain is most usual in patients with femoral head disease, followed by thigh and buttock pain. Weight-bearing and motion-induced pain are seen in most cases. Rest pain occurs in two-thirds of patients, and night pain in approximately one-third.</p><p>Early diagnosis of osteonecrosis may provide the opportunity to prevent collapse and ultimately the need for joint replacement. However, most patients present late in the course of the disease. Thus, a high index of suspicion is necessary for those with known or probable risk factors, particularly high dose steroid use. The diagnosis is made radiographically. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteonecrosis (avascular necrosis of bone)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Occult hip fracture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An occult hip fracture (nondisplaced fracture of the femoral neck) can be difficult to diagnose. It should be suspected in patients with severe anterolateral hip tenderness, severe pain with even partial weight bearing, and intolerance to passive rotation of the hip. Routine hip x-rays can be normal in this setting; the patient must remain non-weight bearing if the diagnosis is suspected until MR imaging or serial examination of the hip rules out the diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Aortoiliac vascular occlusive disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with aortoiliac occlusive disease (Leriche's syndrome) may complain of buttock, hip, and, in some cases, thigh claudication. The pain is often described as aching in nature and may be associated with weakness of the hip or thigh with walking. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of lower extremity peripheral artery disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Physical examination may reveal diminished pulses beginning in the groin area bilaterally, with occasional bruits over the iliac and femoral arteries. Other findings include muscle atrophy and slow wound healing in the legs. The examination of the hip joint and soft tissues are essentially normal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Referred pain from the lumbosacral spine or sacroiliac joint</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The back and sacroiliac joints commonly refer pain to or through the hip. The lower lumbar roots refer pain through the gluteus and posterolateral thigh areas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-low-back-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of low back pain in adults&quot;</a>.) The sacroiliac joints refer pain to the gluteal area. Referred pain from these locations should be suspected whenever back symptoms accompany the pain, the pain extends past the knee, paresthesias or hypesthesias accompany the pain, and the examination of the hip joint and soft tissues are unremarkable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All significant diagnoses at the hip can affect ambulation. Thus, the first priority in examining the hip is to evaluate the patient's gait, tolerance of squatting, and general ability to move in the examination room.</p><p>Next, the integrity of the hip joint is assessed by performing passive internal and external rotation, noting the patient's tolerance of the maneuver and any endpoint stiffness. Impairment of range of motion and severe pain at the endpoints of motion suggest the need for immediate evaluation for osteonecrosis, occult fracture, acute synovitis, or metastatic involvement of the femur. If range of motion is normal, palpation of the trochanteric bursa is performed.</p><p>The examination is completed by looking for sources of referred pain to the hip from the lumbar spinal nerves (straight leg raise), sacroiliac joint (palpation of the joint), lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (sensation in the upper outer thigh), and the lower abdominal vascular structures (lower extremity pulses) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F69960\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69960 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Overall hip function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The general function of the hip is assessed by observing the patient's gait and the ability to change positions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Gait</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The objective of observing the patient's gait is to assess the impact of the patient's hip condition on their overall mobility by observing the ability to perform simple movements.</p><p>The patient is asked to walk in the examination room; the maneuver is enhanced by asking the patient to toe and heel walk. Impairment of ambulation and inability to change position smoothly can be affected by severe hip arthritis, involvement of the bony femur (eg, osteonecrosis or metastatic disease), dramatic loss of muscular support, or dramatic loss of lumbosacral nerve function. In general, meralgia paresthetica, mild hip arthritis, and most cases of bursitis have only a minimal impact upon ambulation.</p><p>Specific gait patterns may also be recognized with hip abnormalities.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With a Trendelenburg gait, the patient shifts the torso over the affected hip, thereby reducing the load on the hip and decreasing pain. This suggests the presence of hip joint disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> weakness of the gluteus medius muscle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient with an antalgic gait spends a shorter time weight bearing on the affected side because of pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The short leg limp is secondary to leg length discrepancy, and is characterized by an increase in the up and down movement of the head and shoulders as the body falls onto the short leg and then rises up on the long leg.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Position change</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient can be observed climbing onto the examination table. This maneuver requires a flexible hip joint, strong iliopsoas and quadriceps muscle, and normal lumbosacral nerve roots. Inability to change position smoothly can be affected by severe hip arthritis, involvement of the bony femur (eg, osteonecrosis or metastatic disease), dramatic loss of muscular support, or dramatic loss of lumbosacral nerve function. In general, meralgia paresthetica, mild hip arthritis, and most cases of bursitis have only a minimal impact upon ambulation.</p><p>The patient also can be asked to squat as far as their pain level allows, either free standing or holding onto the examination table. The ability to squat is influenced by the supporting musculature, the hip joint, and the lubricating ability of the trochanteric bursa. Thus, squatting may be impaired by moderate to advanced hip arthritis, moderate to severe bursitis, and any condition reducing the effective strength of the supporting muscles.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Inspection for pelvic obliquity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inspection for pelvic obliquity is used primarily as a screening maneuver for leg length discrepancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F80105\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80105 \">picture 1</a>). Asymmetry of the iliac crests is seen with leg length discrepancy, pelvic fracture, scoliosis, and unilateral paraspinal muscle spasm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Maneuvers assessing specific conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with mild to moderate hip pain and stiffness, normal gait, and normal range of motion of the hip joint, it may be reasonable to treat empirically and avoid further investigation. Empiric treatment includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimizing weight bearing activities (walking and standing)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid physically demanding work, especially work that involves repetitious bending or twisting at the waist</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid direct pressure over the outer hip</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep with a pillow between the legs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perform daily cross-leg, passive stretching exercises</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for 7 to 10 days</p><p/><p>Patients with persistent or chronic symptoms despite these measures, or those with moderate to severe hip pain and stiffness, an antalgic gait, moderate to severe trochanteric bursal tenderness, or acute loss of range of motion of the hip joint need a more comprehensive hip examination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">Internal and external rotation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Internal and external rotation are measured to assess the integrity of the hip joint and to evaluate for pain and stiffness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74743\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74743 \">picture 2</a>). Internal and external rotation can be reduced by the loss of articular cartilage and outgrowth of acetabular osteophytes with osteoarthritis, and the pain and muscle spasm of acute synovitis. A 50-year-old patient averages 45 to 50 degrees of internal and external rotation. Severe osteoarthritis, acute synovitis, and septic arthritis may have as little as 5 to 10 degrees of rotation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Patrick (Fabere) test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Patrick test (also referred to as the FABERE test) allows an assessment of the hip and the sacroiliac joint. The examiner Flexes, ABducts, Externally Rotates, and Extends the affected leg so that the ankle of that leg is on top of the opposite knee (a figure of 4 configuration). The affected leg is then slowly lowered toward the examining table. A negative result occurs when the test leg falls at least parallel to the opposite leg. A positive test result occurs when the affected leg remains above the opposite leg, and may be indicative of hip disease, iliopsoas spasm, or sacroiliac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-hip-pain/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Pain with this maneuver in the absence of pain with passive hip joint motion suggests discomfort arising from the sacroiliac joint.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Palpation of the trochanteric bursa</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The trochanter is palpated in either the sitting or lateral decubitus position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58500\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58500 \">picture 3</a>). Bursitis is the most common cause of trochanteric tenderness. However, tenderness is also seen with occult fracture, stress fracture, and metastatic disease of the femur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">Sensation of the anterolateral thigh</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sensation of the anterolateral thigh is examined in patients with suspected meralgia paresthetica (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62268\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62268 \">picture 4</a>). Loss of sensation (hypesthesia) or a feeling of heightened sensation (dysesthesia or hyperesthesia) is characteristic of the condition. Changes in motor function do not occur since the nerve provides only sensation to the skin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h3\">Straight leg raise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The straight leg raise maneuver is used to determine the degree of irritation of the nerve roots (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64671\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64671 \">picture 5</a>). A positive test elicits pain in the leg, buttock, or back at 60 degrees or less of leg elevation. The pain is usually worsened by dorsiflexion at the ankle and relieved by flexion of the knee and hip. A positive test typically indicates S1 or L5 root irritation. The straight leg raise test has a sensitivity of about 0.80 (indicating relatively few false negative tests) and a lower specificity of about 0.40 (indicating many false positive tests) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-hip-pain/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Thus, a negative test makes a herniated disc unlikely, although its presence is nonspecific. The test is inconclusive if tightness or pain is felt only in the hamstring area. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-low-back-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of low back pain in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h3\">Lower extremity neurologic examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sensory testing of the feet for light touch, pinprick, and deep pain sensation are combined with motor testing of dorsiflexion and plantarflexion to determine the integrity of lower extremity neurologic function. The 5th lumbar root (L4-5 disk) is responsible for sensation over the top of the foot and for dorsiflexion. The S1 root (L5-S1 disk) is responsible for sensation on the bottom of the foot and plantarflexion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h3\">Palpation of the sacroiliac joint</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sacroiliac joint is palpated for local tenderness if an intrinsic condition of the hip is unlikely and the patient describes posterior hip pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F80967\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80967 \">picture 6</a>). Sacroiliac strain and sacroiliitis cause focal tenderness over an area of approximately three centimeters in diameter. Diffuse tenderness extending over a wide area is seen with severe paraspinal muscle spasm.

Further imaging studies, especially magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may be necessary when the history, physical examination, and plain radiographs are inconclusive. Radionuclide scans to localize osteoblastic activity or to localize sites of soft tissue inflammation have largely been supplanted by MRI, especially when MRI is performed with gadolinium enhancement, but scintigraphy can be used if gadolinium contrast-enhanced MRI is unavailable or relatively contraindicated (eg, in patients with severe renal functional impairment).

The character and location of the pain is the key element in establishing the diagnosis. Increased pain with or after use (particularly with weight-bearing) and improvement with rest is the hallmark of a structural joint problem, particularly osteoarthritis. By comparison, constant pain, especially pain at night, suggests an infectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic process. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hip pain can be categorized broadly based upon its location (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pain patterns'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lateral hip pain is unlikely to be due to hip joint disease. Lateral hip pain that is aggravated by direct pressure is the classic pattern of trochanteric bursitis. Progressive lateral hip pain that is aggravated by direct pressure and weight bearing can also be seen with direct involvement of the femur (eg, with metastatic cancer). Lateral hip pain accompanied by paresthesias or hypesthesias is the classic presentation of meralgia paresthetica (lateral femoral cutaneous nerve entrapment).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Anterior hip or groin pain suggests primary involvement of the hip joint itself. A gradual onset of pain in association with variable degrees of impaired movement is consistent with osteoarthritis. Acute groin pain associated with impairment of weight bearing may be caused by osteonecrosis (particularly in the setting of risk factors such as glucocorticoid use), occult fracture (eg, following trauma), acute synovitis, or, uncommonly, septic arthritis. Anterior hip pain may also be caused by an inguinal hernial or lower abdominal pathology.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Posterior (gluteal) hip pain is the least common pain pattern affecting the hip. It is most often a sign of sacroiliac joint disease, lumbar radiculopathy, herpes zoster, or an unusual presentation of hip joint pathology. Diagnostic imaging may be needed to determine the cause.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Anterior thigh pain poses a significant clinical challenge. Primary disease of the hip joint, primary and secondary lesions of the upper femur, stress fracture of the femoral neck, and upper lumbar radiculopathy can refer pain to the anterior thigh. Unless the pain can be reproduced by passive rotation (hip joint), by applying torque to the thigh (femur), or by maneuvers designed to elicit radicular symptoms (eg, straight leg raising), diagnostic imaging is often needed to determine a precise cause.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Examination of the hip follows a standard approach, including inspection, palpation, strength and motor testing, and special tests. It is important to evaluate the patient's gait, tolerance of squatting, and general mobility. A screening neurovascular examination should be performed. Details of the hip examination are provided in the text. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Examination'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cause of subacute or chronic hip pain can be difficult to determine and diagnostic imaging may be needed.
