This topic will discuss the modes of ventilation, ventilator settings, and lung protective ventilation during anesthesia. The deleterious effects of mechanical ventilation are discussed in detail separately.

Terminology for the modes of ventilation is not standardized, and comparison between the technologies available in the ICU and in the operating room can be confusing. The modes of assisted and controlled ventilation that are available with most anesthesia machines are discussed here. Modes of ventilation in the intensive care unit are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of mechanical ventilation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Volume controlled ventilation (VCV) and pressure controlled ventilation (PCV) are the basic modes of controlled mechanical ventilation used during general anesthesia. Pressure support and pressure control with volume guarantee (PV-VG) are also available on newer anesthesia machines. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4278879239\"><span class=\"h2\">Volume-controlled ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Volume-controlled ventilation (VC) is also called volume-limited, or volume-cycled ventilation. At a minimum, the clinician sets the tidal volume and respiratory rate (and thus the minute ventilation), and the ventilator delivers the tidal volume at a constant flow rate. Advantages of VCV are that the set minute ventilation is essentially guaranteed (unless peak pressures exceed the set limit), and the fact that VCV is a commonly used technique, familiar to clinicians. However, VCV is associated with higher peak pressure for a given inspired volume, compared with PCV. Barotrauma is possible, and gas distribution in the lung may be uneven, particularly in patients with lung disease. </p><p>The parameters that may be set by the clinician during VCV include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tidal volume (TV)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory rate (RR)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inspiratory time (TI) to expiratory time (TE) ratio (I:E ratio)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pressure limit (Pmax)</p><p/><p>Compliance of the breathing circuit and fresh gas flows can affect the delivered tidal volume during VCV, though the degree of variation is of little clinical significance in most adults. Some anesthesia ventilators can adjust for fresh gas flows and breathing circuit compliance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-during-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]; these features may be particularly important for neonates and infants, in whom small changes in their already small tidal volumes can cause over or under ventilation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4016932317\"><span class=\"h2\">Pressure controlled ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For pressure controlled ventilation (PCV), also called pressure-limited ventilation, the clinician sets the inspiratory pressure, inspiratory time, and respiratory rate. The ventilator maintains constant pressure during the inspiratory time, while flow decelerates. PCV is associated with lower peak airway pressure for the same inspired volume, and in some patient populations, more homogeneous gas distribution, less alveolar overdistention, and lower risk of barotrauma, compared with VCV. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-mechanical-ventilation#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of mechanical ventilation&quot;, section on 'Volume-limited versus pressure-limited'</a>.)</p><p>An important limitation of PCV, particularly during surgery, is that tidal volume varies with changes in lung compliance. Compliance can change because of insufflation during laparoscopy, placement of retractors or surgical packs, changes in positioning, or the degree of muscle relaxation. Therefore, the use of PCV in the operating room may require frequent adjustment of ventilator settings to avoid over- or under-ventilation.</p><p>The parameters that may be set by the clinician during PCV include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RR</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inspiratory time or I:E ratio</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PEEP</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pmax</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3076063010\"><span class=\"h2\">Pressure control with volume guarantee</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pressure control with volume guarantee (PCV-VG) combines the advantages of VCV and PCV, and is our preferred mode of ventilation. PCV-VG is available only on newer anesthesia machines. The set tidal volume is delivered at the lowest required inspiratory pressure, adjusted breath by breath, with the decelerating flow pattern used for PCV. PCV-VG may be useful for patients with low compliance (eg, morbid obesity, underlying lung disease such as emphysema or acute respiratory distress syndrome, neonates and infants) and during surgery in which lung compliance is likely to vary (eg, laparoscopy or thoracoscopy). Parameters that may be set by the clinician using PCV-VG include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TV</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RR</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>I:E ratio</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PEEP</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pmax</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4286977293\"><span class=\"h2\">Pressure support</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pressure support ventilation (PSV) is a mode of assisted ventilation used to augment the patient&rsquo;s breaths. It may be used to reduce the work of breathing related to airway device resistance, to counteract respiratory depressant effects of anesthetic medications, and to support ventilation during emergence from anesthesia. PSV is often used with a supraglottic airway (SGA) in place. Peak pressures should be kept between 15 and 20 cmH2O to avoid leakage around the SGA and gastric insufflation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=supraglottic-devices-including-laryngeal-mask-airways-for-airway-management-for-anesthesia-in-adults#H697568266\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Supraglottic devices (including laryngeal mask airways) for airway management for anesthesia in adults&quot;, section on 'Choice of mode of ventilation'</a>.)</p><p>During PSV, the ventilator delivers a preset pressure above the set level of PEEP to augment a patient initiated breath. Inspiratory flow decreases during the breath, and inspiration ends when the inspiratory flow rate reaches a preset value, usually a decline of 25 percent. Tidal volume varies with lung compliance and airway resistance.</p><p>With most anesthesia machines, a minimum respiratory rate can be set during pressure support ventilation. The ventilator will deliver pressure control breaths when the spontaneous respiratory rate is below the set minimum.

SIMV provides assured rates and tidal volumes, with ventilator breaths synchronized with patient breaths. SIMV may be used with VCV or PCV, with or without pressure support (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F112618\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112618 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p>Similar to PSV, SIMV may be used to reduce the work of breathing, counter the respiratory depressant effects of anesthetic medications, and to support ventilation while weaning from controlled ventilation at the end of surgery.</p><p>Parameters that may be set by the clinician during SIMV with VCV or PCV plus PSV include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tidal volume (TV) for SIMV-VCV or peak inspiratory (PIP) for SIMV-PCV</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimal RR</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inspiratory time (TI) to expiratory time (TE) ratio (I:E ratio)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PEEP</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pmax</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Level of pressure support, if applicable.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pressure or flow trigger</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2510637227\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOICE OF MODE OF VENTILATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Choice of the mode of ventilation should be based on patient factors, the surgical procedure, and available technology. For many healthy patients who undergo routine surgery, any mode of ventilation may be used to provide effective and safe intraoperative ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-during-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Pressure controlled ventilation may be preferred in some clinical scenarios, as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pressure controlled ventilation (PCV) or pressure control with volume guarantee (PCV-VG) may be preferred when a supraglottic airway is in place, and for patients in whom high inspiratory pressures may be dangerous (eg, emphysema, neonates and infants). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PCV-VG may be preferred to maintain minute ventilation in patients with high or changing intraabdominal pressure (eg, morbid obesity, during laparoscopy or thoracoscopy, pregnancy).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4169114045\"><span class=\"h1\">FRACTION OF INSPIRED OXYGEN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Supplemental oxygen (ie, &gt;21 percent) is routinely administered before, during, and immediately after anesthesia, to prevent desaturation during airway management, and to compensate for the impairment of gas exchange associated with the residual&nbsp;effects&nbsp;of anesthetic and analgesic drugs. However, a high fraction of inspired oxygen may have deleterious effects, including absorption atelectasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-during-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], airway and parenchymal lung injury, and extrapulmonary toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-during-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxygen-toxicity#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oxygen toxicity&quot;, section on 'Clinical consequences'</a>.) &#160;</p><p>The total amount of oxygen exposure during anesthesia should be limited, and FiO<sub>2</sub> of 0.3 to 0.4 should provide adequate oxygenation with a margin of safety for most patients.

In one large, single center retrospective database study including 73,922 cases, median FiO<sub>2</sub> was associated with a dose dependent increase in major respiratory complications and mortality, across a range of low to high FiO<sub>2</sub> (median 0.31 to 0.79) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-during-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In this study, 4.1 percent of patients developed a major respiratory complication within seven days of surgery.

High FiO<sub>2</sub> probably has a weak beneficial effect on postoperative nausea, if any, and other interventions for prophylaxis are of much greater value.

ETCO<sub>2</sub> generally correlates well with PaCO<sub>2</sub>, but a number of factors (eg, age, lung disease, surgical positioning) can cause a significant, variable discrepancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-during-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. It is not uncommon to find a difference of 8 to 10 mmHg between ETCO<sub>2</sub> and PaCO<sub>2</sub>. PaCO<sub>2</sub> should be measured when close control of ventilation is necessary (eg, patients with increased intracranial pressure).</p><p>In patients with obstructive lung disease and an upsloping end tidal CO<sub>2</sub> plateau, inspiration may occur before the true end of expiration, and result in a falsely low ETCO<sub>2</sub> (in addition to predisposing to dynamic hyperinflation). Reducing the respiratory rate (or briefly stopping the ventilator) should allow full exhalation and an accurate ETCO<sub>2</sub> reading (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F112619\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112619 \">figure 2</a>). &#160; </p><p>Mild intraoperative hypocapnia has historically been the aim during anesthesia. However, hypocapnia (ie, PaCO<sub>2</sub> 25 to 30 mmHg) induced by hyperventilation and the associated alkalosis may have deleterious physiologic effects, including decreased cerebral blood flow and oxygen delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-during-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>], increases in lung microvascular permeability, bronchoconstriction and decreased lung compliance, increase in shunt, and a leftward shift of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-during-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>In contrast, mild hypercapnia (ie, PaCO<sub>2</sub> 50 mmHg or ETCO<sub>2</sub> 40 to 45 mmHg) may increase tissue perfusion and oxygenation, due to an increase in cardiac output and vasodilation, and a rightward shift of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-during-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>]. In addition, the lower respiratory rates required for permissive hypercapnia decrease lung strain and stress. Hypercapnia should be used cautiously in patients with cardiac disease, because of the associated increase in cardiac output.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H734583409\"><span class=\"h1\">RESPIRATORY RATE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Respiratory rate for controlled ventilation should be set to achieve minute ventilation that maintains ETCO<sub>2</sub> at approximately 40 mmHg. Respiratory rate is often set at 8 to 12 breaths per minute, and adjusted thereafter based on ETCO<sub>2</sub>. The use of low tidal volumes as part of lung protective ventilation may require a high respiratory rate to adequately eliminate CO<sub>2</sub>, especially during CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation for laparoscopy. During high respiratory rates (&gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">breaths/min),</span> and at lower respiratory rates for patients with limited expiratory flow (eg, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]), inspiration can occur before full exhalation (ie, breath stacking). Dynamic hyperinflation and auto-positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) can occur, and can lead to hypoxemia, hyperinflation, and barotrauma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-patients-with-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease#H85183455\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&quot;, section on 'Mechanical ventilation'</a>.)</p><p>End expiratory flow may be monitored when respiratory rates are high. As long as expiratory flow tracing displayed on the anesthesia machine returns to zero, auto-PEEP should not occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-during-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H676156028\"><span class=\"h1\">INSPIRATORY TO EXPIRATORY RATIO</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The inspiratory:expiratory (I:E) ratio during mechanical ventilation is usually set at approximately 1:2, similar to the ratio during normal spontaneous ventilation. The I:E ratio may be reduced (ie, increasing the inspiratory time) to improve ventilation of lung regions that fill more slowly (ie, atelectatic lung regions) or to reduce peak pressure during volume controlled ventilation. The author usually sets the I:E ratio at 1:1.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1663506702\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING PULMONARY MECHANICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most newer anesthesia machines allow display of pressure volume loops and flow volume loops. These graphs can be used to optimize ventilator settings, and to monitor changes in compliance, and extrinsic and intrinsic airway obstruction. Some machines display both baseline and real time curves for comparison. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H854846152\"><span class=\"h2\">Pressure volume loops</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pressure-volume loops are most useful as an indication of compliance. Pressure is plotted on the horizontal axis, and volume is plotted on the vertical axis. During positive pressure ventilation, breaths progress in a counterclockwise direction, with inspiration curving upward, and expiration curving downward (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F112620\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112620 \">figure 3</a>). Thus the upper right point on the graph represents peak inspiratory pressure and tidal volume. The lower left point of the loop appears at zero volume, and the set level of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP). </p><p>A line drawn from the zero point through the point of end inspiration represents compliance. With good compliance, this line forms an angle of &le;45 degrees with the vertical axis. If compliance decreases during mechanical ventilation, the line becomes more horizontal and the curve is rotated to the right. This shift will appear differently during pressure controlled ventilation compared with volume controlled ventilation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F112621\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112621 \">figure 4</a>). Compliance may change intraoperatively (and be reflected in the pressure volume loops) because of changes in position, surgical manipulation, intraabdominal bleeding, carbon dioxide insufflation for laparoscopy, and development of lung disease (eg, pneumonia, pulmonary edema). A mainstem intubation may be indicated by a higher peak airway pressure and a more horizontal pressure volume loop than expected.</p><p>Pressure volume loops may indicate that excessive pressure or volume is being used during positive pressure ventilation. A &ldquo;bird beak&rdquo; pattern (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F112622\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112622 \">figure 5</a>) suggests that a portion of the breath is increasing inspiratory pressure without achieving an appreciable increase in volume, which may increase the risk of barotrauma. The pressure (during pressure control ventilation [PCV]), or volume (during volume controlled ventilation [VCV]) should be reduced to optimize ventilation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3430453314\"><span class=\"h2\">Flow volume loops</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The flow-volume loop is most useful as an indication of resistance. Volume is plotted on the horizontal axis and flow is plotted on the vertical axis. On anesthesia machines, flow volume loops may be displayed in reverse orientation from conventional spirometry, with inspiration above the horizontal line and expiration below, and with volume increasing from left to right on the horizontal axis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F112623\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112623 \">figure 6</a>). When displayed this way, breaths progress in a clockwise direction, and the shape of the inspiratory curve depends on the mode of ventilation (eg, pressure control or volume control). Flow increases as inspiration begins, and decreases to zero as the breath ends.

Pressure control with volume guarantee (PC-VG) is available on newer anesthesia machines. (See <a href=\"#H1007941548\" class=\"local\">'Modes of intraoperative mechanical ventilation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>With VCV, the tidal volume and respiratory rate set by the clinician determine the minute ventilation. The tidal volume is essentially guaranteed, but higher inspiratory pressures are required for a given inspired volume, compared with PCV. (See <a href=\"#H4278879239\" class=\"local\">'Volume-controlled ventilation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For PCV, the clinician sets the inspiratory pressure, inspiratory time, and respiratory rate. PCV is associated with lower peak airway pressures than VCV for a given inspired volume, but tidal volume and minute ventilation can vary with changes in compliance that may occur during surgery (eg, insufflation during laparoscopy, placement of retractors or surgical packs, changes in position, and the degree of muscle relaxation). (See <a href=\"#H4016932317\" class=\"local\">'Pressure controlled ventilation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>PCV-VG is the preferred mode of controlled ventilation where it is available. The set tidal volume is delivered at the lowest required inspiratory pressure, adjusted breath by breath as necessary based on changes in compliance. PCV-VG is particularly useful for patients in whom compliance is expected to change repeatedly during surgery (eg, during laparoscopy or thoracoscopy). (See <a href=\"#H3076063010\" class=\"local\">'Pressure control with volume guarantee'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pressure support may be used to augment spontaneous ventilation, and is often used with a supraglottic airway in place, or to support ventilation during emergence from anesthesia. The ventilator delivers a preset pressure above the set level of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP), to augment a patient initiated breath. (See <a href=\"#H4286977293\" class=\"local\">'Pressure support'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) is also used to augment spontaneous ventilation with ensured tidal volume and rate, and can be used with either volume control or pressure control, with or without pressure support. (See <a href=\"#H2048716002\" class=\"local\">'Synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation modes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supplemental oxygen is routinely administered before, during, and after anesthesia. Administration of high fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) may prevent desaturation during airway management, and can compensate for the impairment of gas exchange associated with anesthesia. However, a high FiO<sub>2</sub> may cause absorption atelectasis, The administration of high fraction of inspired oxygen with the goal of preventing surgical infections is controversial. (See <a href=\"#H4169114045\" class=\"local\">'Fraction of inspired oxygen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goal for intraoperative ventilation should be an end tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO<sub>2</sub>) of approximately 40 mmHg, unless therapeutic hyperventilation is indicated.
