Adults may have goiters that are diffuse or nodular, and the goiters may be associated with normal, decreased, or increased thyroid hormone production. The management of goiter depends upon the cause. This topic primarily focuses on the management of nontoxic, nonobstructive diffuse or multinodular goiter. The treatment of obstructive or substernal goiter, toxic multinodular goiter, Graves' disease, thyroiditis, and goiter due to iodine deficiency are reviewed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-obstructive-or-substernal-goiter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of obstructive or substernal goiter&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-toxic-adenoma-and-toxic-multinodular-goiter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of toxic adenoma and toxic multinodular goiter&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=graves-hyperthyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults-overview-of-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Graves' hyperthyroidism in nonpregnant adults: Overview of treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subacute-thyroiditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subacute thyroiditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=painless-thyroiditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Painless thyroiditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iodine-deficiency-disorders#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iodine deficiency disorders&quot;, section on 'Prophylaxis and treatment'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6510397\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once goiter is detected (on physical exam or incidentally during a radiologic procedure performed for other purposes), an evaluation is performed to assess thyroid function and to identify the underlying cause, presence of obstructive symptoms, and presence of suspicious sonographic features in nodules within the goiter. These factors determine management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-goiter-in-adults#H6509061\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and evaluation of goiter in adults&quot;, section on 'Approach to evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>For patients with benign, nontoxic, nonobstructive goiter (multinodular goiter, goitrous Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and iodine deficiency goiter), the goals of management are to correct underlying hypothyroidism (Hashimoto's, severe iodine deficiency), if present, and if the goiter is cosmetically concerning, to decrease the size or prevent further growth.</p><p>Hypothyroidism, if present, should be treated with thyroid hormone (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levothyroxine</a>) replacement therapy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary hypothyroidism in adults&quot;</a>). Over time, treatment with thyroid hormone may reduce the size of the goiter, particularly in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis with elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels (see <a href=\"#H6512274\" class=\"local\">'Goitrous Hashimoto's'</a> below). In many cases, however, the goiter does not resolve completely, and additional therapy is required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6513698\"><span class=\"h1\">NONTOXIC NODULAR GOITER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nontoxic nodular goiter refers to a nodular goiter not associated with increased thyroid hormone production. In the United States, benign multinodular goiter is the most common cause of nontoxic goiter in older adults, although over time, multinodular goiters may develop areas of autonomy and become associated with increased thyroid function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-toxic-adenoma-and-toxic-multinodular-goiter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of toxic adenoma and toxic multinodular goiter&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6510505\"><span class=\"h2\">Therapeutic options</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main options for management of nontoxic nodular goiter include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Observation with monitoring</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thyroidectomy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radioiodine</p><p/><p>Thyroid hormone suppression therapy may have a <strong>limited</strong> role in patients with nontoxic nodular goiter. However, the efficacy of thyroid hormone suppressive therapy in euthyroid patients with sporadic nontoxic goiter is controversial, and its use has declined due to concerns about potential long-term side effects from the induction of subclinical hyperthyroidism.</p><p>There is no consensus on the ideal treatment of nontoxic benign goiter, and there are advantages and disadvantages of each treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F78621\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78621 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nontoxic-nonobstructive-goiter/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The lack of consensus is due, in part, to the variable natural history of benign goiter. In up to 20 percent of women and 5 percent of men, the goiter stabilizes or spontaneously regresses over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nontoxic-nonobstructive-goiter/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, in other patients, the goiter gradually increases in size over time with the development of additional nodules, compressive symptoms, and cosmetic concerns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nontoxic-nonobstructive-goiter/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>There are few trials comparing interventions. In one trial, 64 patients with sporadic nontoxic multinodular goiter (average size 60 mL) were randomly assigned to radioiodine (120 microcuries [4.44 <span class=\"nowrap\">megabecquerels]/g</span> thyroid) or suppressive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levothyroxine</a> treatment (goal TSH between 0.01 and 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L)</span>. After two years, 97 percent of the patients treated with radioiodine and 43 percent of those treated with levothyroxine had a decrease in goiter size. The median decrease in goiter size (by ultrasound) was 41 percent in the group treated with radioiodine compared with a clinically insignificant 5 percent in the suppressive levothyroxine treatment group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nontoxic-nonobstructive-goiter/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Although none of the patients had overt hyperthyroidism at baseline, 17 had subclinical hyperthyroidism (low TSH, normal free thyroxine [T4]), which may bias the results in favor of radioiodine. Hypothyroidism developed in 45 percent of patients receiving radioiodine. Patients who were treated with suppressive doses of thyroid hormone were more likely to have thyrotoxic symptoms and a decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) (mean decrease of 3.6 percent at the lumbar spine, compared with no change in the radioiodine group).</p><p>In an observational study examining quality-of-life indicators in patients with nontoxic benign goiter, the treatment modality (predominantly surgery or radioiodine) did not affect change in scale scores, which improved posttreatment but remained worse than those in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nontoxic-nonobstructive-goiter/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>In the absence of adequate randomized trial data, management decisions should be individualized based upon patient factors, regional medical practices, and the following general principles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F78621\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78621 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The decision to perform thyroidectomy is based upon the results of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy of any nodule(s) that may be present, the presence of cosmetic concerns, or other concomitant conditions such as hyperparathyroidism requiring surgery. Patients with nodules that are malignant or suspicious for malignancy on FNA biopsy require surgery.

In addition, thyroid hormone suppressive therapy is not an option for patients with serum TSH concentrations at the lower limit of or just below the normal range, because these patients already have endogenous suppression of TSH.

We also monitor with thyroid ultrasound (initially annually, then at increasing intervals over time assuming stability [eg, two to five years] to evaluate for growth). Nodules with indeterminate or suspicious ultrasound features should be considered for biopsy because the prevalence of cancer in an individual nodule in a goiter is independent of the number of sonographically identified nodules.

For euthyroid patients with very large goiters or goiters that continue to grow and potentially cause obstructive signs, symptoms, or cosmetic concerns, we prefer surgery over radioiodine. The reduction in thyroid volume with radioiodine is only moderate, the treated goiter requires continued monitoring for growth, and periodic imaging may raise concerns of a missed malignancy. Nevertheless, radioiodine therapy is an option for patients who are poor surgical candidates, for those who prefer to avoid surgery, or for those in whom the primary concern is autonomy with risk of developing subclinical or overt hyperthyroidism.

Radioiodine therapy is relatively infrequently used in the United States for the treatment of nontoxic goiter. Due to high dietary iodine intake, thyroid iodine uptake is typically low in patients with nontoxic goiter, and therefore, a relatively high dose of radioiodine is required for goiter reduction. Radioiodine for the treatment of nontoxic nodular goiter is more commonly used in Europe, and in particular Denmark and the Netherlands.</p><p>In the absence of a history of childhood neck radiation, we do not typically treat patients with nontoxic benign goiters who are poor surgical candidates with thyroid hormone suppressive therapy. The efficacy of thyroid hormone suppressive therapy in euthyroid patients with sporadic nontoxic goiter is controversial, and its use has declined due to concerns about potential long-term side effects from the induction of subclinical hyperthyroidism. When used, thyroxine must be continued long term as any reduction in goiter size during therapy is lost upon discontinuation of thyroxine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nontoxic-nonobstructive-goiter/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

In most studies, the patients were older; had respiratory symptoms, dysphagia, or recent thyroid growth; and were considered poor surgical candidates or had refused surgery. Overall, the reported reduction in goiter size (as measured by ultrasound) ranged from 40 to 60 percent within one to two years of therapy, with most of the effect occurring in the first three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nontoxic-nonobstructive-goiter/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Obstructive symptoms improved in most patients with increases in tracheal luminal diameter. There are fewer observational studies of radioiodine therapy for the treatment of nontoxic diffuse goiter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nontoxic-nonobstructive-goiter/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. In two studies, median thyroid volume reduction was 50 to 60 percent within one year of therapy.</p><p>The factors determining outcome were analyzed in one study of 50 patients in whom the mean reduction in goiter size was 47 percent (median follow-up 41 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nontoxic-nonobstructive-goiter/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Eleven patients (22 percent) had no decrease in goiter size or a transient decrease and then re-enlargement of their goiter. The reduction in goiter size was greater in younger patients; those with smaller goiters, a shorter history of goiter, or dominant nodules; and those given higher doses of radioiodine. The baseline serum TSH concentration was not a determinant of reduction in goiter size, but a higher (but still normal) value was associated with a higher risk of hypothyroidism. (See <a href=\"#H6511194\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6511162\"><span class=\"h5\">Dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The dose of radioiodine in these studies ranged from 75 to 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">microcuries/g</span> tissue (2.8 to 14.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">megabecquerels/g</span> tissue). Most patients received doses between 100 and 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">microcuries/g</span> (3.7 and 7.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">megabecquerels/g),</span> similar to those used to treat hyperthyroidism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radioiodine-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radioiodine in the treatment of hyperthyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The dose was usually calculated by the following formula:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;Dose (activity) &#160;= &#160;(thyroid weight &#160;x &#160;desired radioiodine delivery to thyroid) &#160;&divide; &#160;radioiodine uptake</p></div></div><p>The units are grams for thyroid weight and <span class=\"nowrap\">microcuries/g</span> for radioiodine delivery; radioiodine uptake is expressed as a decimal (ie, 20 percent = 0.20).</p><p>The 24-hour thyroid radioiodine uptake is considerably lower in patients with nontoxic multinodular goiter than in patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism or toxic multinodular goiter. As a result, the dose of radioiodine needed may exceed that permissible for outpatients, which varies from state-to-state in the United States and also among other countries.</p><p>An alternative approach is to use multiple fractionated doses of radioiodine. When 60 millicuries (2.22 gigabecquerels) was given in four divided monthly doses to patients with obstructive goiter in one report, 71 percent had improvement in symptoms related to compression of neck structures and 92 percent had a reduction in goiter size, but 66 percent became hypothyroid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nontoxic-nonobstructive-goiter/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Slightly over one-half of the patients had toxic nodular goiter.

The proposed dosing for treatment of nontoxic multinodular goiter is much lower than for thyroid cancer, and a preparation designed for use in patients with nontoxic goiter is not currently available.</p><p>Pretreatment with rhTSH increases radioiodine uptake in nontoxic nodular goiter, and results in a more homogeneous distribution of uptake by stimulating uptake in relatively cold areas more than in relatively hot areas, particularly in those with low serum TSH concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nontoxic-nonobstructive-goiter/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. Thus, administration of rhTSH allows for treatment with lower doses of radioiodine without compromising efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nontoxic-nonobstructive-goiter/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. It has been shown to be a useful adjunct to radioiodine for the treatment of nontoxic multinodular goiter, especially when the radioiodine uptake is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nontoxic-nonobstructive-goiter/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. The proposed dose of rhTSH is much lower than that used for treatment and diagnostic testing in patients with thyroid cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differentiated-thyroid-cancer-radioiodine-treatment#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differentiated thyroid cancer: Radioiodine treatment&quot;, section on 'Recombinant human TSH'</a>.)</p><p>In a meta-analysis of nine trials, radioiodine with rhTSH (0.005 to 0.45 mg administered 24 hours prior to radioiodine) was significantly more effective in reducing goiter volume than radioiodine alone (weighted mean difference 14.42 to 19.66 percent ) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nontoxic-nonobstructive-goiter/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. As an example, in a randomized trial of radioiodine treatment calculated to give a thyroidal dose of 100 grays administered 24 hours after rhTSH (0.3 mg) or placebo, patients receiving rhTSH had a greater reduction in goiter size at one year (62 versus 46 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nontoxic-nonobstructive-goiter/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The median radioiodine dose was similar in the two groups.</p><p>In another trial, 90 patients with nontoxic nodular goiter (median size 63 mL) were randomly assigned to either 0.1 mg rhTSH and radioiodine (50 grays) or placebo and radioiodine (100 grays) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nontoxic-nonobstructive-goiter/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. After 12 months, the mean reduction in goiter volume was identical (35 percent), even though the rhTSH group received half the dose of radioiodine as the placebo group. Both groups reported improvement in goiter symptoms.</p><p>Compared with radioiodine alone, the use of rhTSH prior to radioiodine is associated with a higher incidence of hypothyroidism (62 versus 11 percent in one trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nontoxic-nonobstructive-goiter/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]). However, in the trial described above in which patients who were pretreated with rhTSH received one-half the dose of radioiodine, the difference in the prevalence of hypothyroidism one year after treatment was not significant (12 versus 7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nontoxic-nonobstructive-goiter/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. These results suggest that pretreatment with rhTSH allows a major reduction in radioiodine dose without changing efficacy. The reduction in radioiodine dose may facilitate outpatient treatment and reduce the risk of side effects.</p><p>Long-term follow-up in two of these trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nontoxic-nonobstructive-goiter/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>] found that goiter volume was reduced further in all patients after a mean 71 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nontoxic-nonobstructive-goiter/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The reduction in goiter volume remained higher in the rhTSH group (70 versus 56 percent in the group who received radioiodine without rhTSH), and the number of patients requiring additional therapy for obstructive symptoms was lower in the rhTSH group (5 versus 20 percent in the group who were not pretreated with rhTSH). The prevalence of hypothyroidism remained higher in the rhTSH group (52 versus 16 percent).</p><p>A potential concern about pretreatment with rhTSH is an increase in goiter size after administration of rhTSH. This was illustrated in a study of 10 patients with nodular goiter given 0.3 mg of rhTSH who then experienced an increase in mean goiter size at 24 hours of 9.8 percent and at 48 hours of 24 percent, returning to baseline at one week, suggesting that rhTSH could cause obstructive symptoms in patients with near obstructive goiters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nontoxic-nonobstructive-goiter/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, in another study using rhTSH to reduce goiter size in 14 patients with large goiters, the smallest cross-sectional area of the trachea measured by MRI was found to be 10.5 percent greater one week after radioiodine administration, although the forced vital capacity was slightly reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nontoxic-nonobstructive-goiter/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. A modified-release, very-low-dose rhTSH preparation (0.01 to 0.03 mg) has been studied that results in lower peak serum TSH levels and, therefore, might be associated with less risk of goiter enlargement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nontoxic-nonobstructive-goiter/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3078149386\"><span class=\"h5\">Pretreatment with methimazole to increase the radioiodine uptake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methimazole</a> increases TSH by reducing thyroid hormone synthesis. One would anticipate that the higher level of TSH would be associated with a higher radioiodine uptake. This was demonstrated in a preliminary study of five women treated with methimazole 10 to 15 mg daily for two to four months prior to administration of radioiodine. TSH increased from 0.32 to 2.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/L,</span> and the radioiodine uptake increased from 25.6 to 49.2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nontoxic-nonobstructive-goiter/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Thyroid volume was reduced by a mean of 46 percent after 30 millicuries of radioiodine. This approach requires further investigation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6512274\"><span class=\"h1\">GOITROUS HASHIMOTO'S</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hashimoto's thyroiditis (chronic autoimmune thyroiditis) is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas of the world. It is characterized clinically by gradual thyroid failure, diffuse goiter formation, or both, due to autoimmune-mediated destruction of the thyroid gland involving apoptosis of thyroid epithelial cells. The two major forms of the disorder are goitrous autoimmune thyroiditis and atrophic autoimmune thyroiditis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (chronic autoimmune thyroiditis)&quot;, section on 'Clinical characteristics'</a>.)</p><p>The thyroid enlargement that can occur in patients with goitrous autoimmune thyroiditis is usually asymptomatic. In patients with goitrous Hashimoto's and elevated serum TSH levels, treatment with thyroid hormone may reduce the size of the goiter. Rare patients have significant thyroid enlargement, sometimes with thyroid pain and tenderness. Such patients may require surgery for symptomatic relief. There is one report of the use of radioiodine in goitrous Hashimoto's thyroiditis unresponsive to levothyroxine-suppressive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nontoxic-nonobstructive-goiter/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Thirteen patients received two to six doses of 13 millicuries radioiodine at one- to six-month intervals, which resulted in a 59 percent reduction in goiter size.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7829601\"><span class=\"h1\">IODINE DEFICIENCY GOITER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Iodine deficiency is the most common cause of goiter worldwide. The goiter is initially diffuse but eventually becomes nodular because the cells in some thyroid follicles proliferate more than others, and larger nodules may undergo hemorrhage, cystic change, and calcification. Therefore, in regions of iodine deficiency, children and adolescents generally have diffuse goiters, while adults who lived in conditions of longstanding iodine deficiency have nodular goiter. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iodine-deficiency-disorders#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iodine deficiency disorders&quot;, section on 'Diffuse and nodular goiter'</a>.)</p><p>In areas of severe iodine deficiency, iodine replacement can reduce diffuse goiter size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nontoxic-nonobstructive-goiter/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>], but it is relatively ineffective in individuals with longstanding nodular goiters. However, iodine deficiency is a global public health problem, and in combating it, emphasis should be placed on diagnosis and correction at the level of the community rather than the individual. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iodine-deficiency-disorders#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iodine deficiency disorders&quot;, section on 'Prophylaxis and treatment'</a>.)</p><p>For adults who move from iodine-deficient to iodine-sufficient areas (eg, the United States), urinary iodine will reflect the United States iodine-sufficient diet within weeks. Adults with longstanding iodine deficiency goiter are unlikely to experience any reduction in goiter size with initiation of an iodine-sufficient diet. It is important to note that iodine administration may result in hyperthyroidism in patients with iodine deficiency goiter who have autonomously functioning tissue. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iodine-induced-thyroid-dysfunction#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iodine-induced thyroid dysfunction&quot;, section on 'Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism'</a>.)</p><p>For patients from an area of iodine deficiency who have persistent goiter after changing to an iodine-sufficient diet, the indications and means for intervention are the same as described above.

(See <a href=\"#H6510397\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary hypothyroidism in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main options for management of benign nontoxic nodular goiter include observation with monitoring, thyroidectomy, or radioiodine. The role of thyroid hormone suppression therapy is controversial, and its use has declined due to concerns about potential long-term side effects from the induction of subclinical hyperthyroidism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F78621\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78621 \">table 1</a>). In the absence of adequate randomized trial data, management decisions should be individualized based upon patient characteristics.

Patients should be monitored for the development of thyroid dysfunction or for continued growth of the thyroid gland <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the development of obstructive symptoms. We perform annual neck exams and obtain yearly thyroid function tests (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]). For patients with benign multinodular goiter, we also monitor with thyroid ultrasound (initially annually, then at increasing intervals over time assuming stability [eg, two to five years] to evaluate for growth). (See <a href=\"#H8735302\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic, stable goiter'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with very large goiters (&gt;80 to 100 mL) or goiters that continue to grow, we suggest surgery rather than monitoring because of concern regarding continuous growth and possible development of compressive symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thyroid autonomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Radioiodine therapy is an alternative option, particularly for patients who are poor surgical candidates or for those who prefer to avoid surgery. In addition, radioiodine may be useful for those patients with low-normal or low serum TSH concentrations whose goiters have autonomous areas with relatively higher radioiodine uptake. However, the reduction in thyroid volume with radioiodine is only moderate, the treated goiter requires continued monitoring for growth, and periodic imaging may raise concerns of a missed malignancy.
