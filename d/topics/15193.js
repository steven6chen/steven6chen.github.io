Of these, approximately 20 percent can be attributed to the consequences of coronary heart disease (CHD). Patients with varying degrees of chronic kidney dysfunction but who are not yet dialysis dependent also have a markedly increased risk of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease, including CHD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient survival and maintenance dialysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic kidney disease and coronary heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, the relative prevalence of the various types of cardiac disease differs in dialysis patients compared with the general population. As an example, the single, largest, specific cause of death is attributed to arrhythmic mechanisms or sudden cardiac arrest, accounting for approximately 60 percent of all cardiac deaths. Nevertheless, the rate of death from myocardial infarction and the incidence of CHD are increased among dialysis patients versus those without kidney disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-sudden-cardiac-death-in-dialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of sudden cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death in dialysis patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic review will address the risk factors and epidemiology of CHD in dialysis patients.

This includes only modest degrees of kidney dysfunction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> albuminuria. As a result, practice guidelines from the National Kidney Foundation and the American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart Association task force have recommended that CKD be considered a CHD risk equivalent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-and-epidemiology-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic kidney disease and coronary heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, whether CKD per se is a risk factor for CHD depends on the completeness of adjustment for the nontraditional risk factors, including those that are unique to uremia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Uremia and renal replacement therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uremia and renal replacement therapies result in markedly enhanced oxidant stress, the production of complement fragments and cytokines, increased adhesion molecules in endothelial cells, and other proinflammatory factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-and-epidemiology-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. These factors may provide the proper milieu for the development of accelerated atherosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-and-epidemiology-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis/abstract/19-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-25</a>]. As an example, carbamylation of LDL, a process that occurs in uremia, is associated with multiple proatherogenic effects, including smooth muscle proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-and-epidemiology-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In part, this process also appears to underlie atherogenesis in patients who smoke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-and-epidemiology-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uremic-toxins\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uremic toxins&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A role for increased inflammation due in part to renal replacement therapy and other factors is supported by the observation that increased serum levels of C-reactive protein, an acute-phase protein released in inflammatory disorders, are associated with an enhanced risk of cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-and-epidemiology-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. Although indirect, additional support for this pathogenic factor is provided by studies showing that dialysis vintage (eg, the time on dialysis) is a major risk factor for coronary artery calcification, which may reflect atherosclerosis or nonatherosclerotic medial calcification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-and-epidemiology-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].
