The risk of radiation-induced thyroid neoplasms is more common after childhood than adult radiation exposure and is, in part, related to radiation dose.

Ionizing radiation from medical imaging now accounts for nearly half of the radiation exposure experienced by the population in the United States.</p><p>Concern has been raised about a potential increase in risk of thyroid cancer in children receiving frequent diagnostic radiographs, particularly computed tomography (CT) scans. Thus far, the potential risk has been calculated assuming a linear extrapolation dose-response model. However, due to the difficulty of performing studies at the very-low-dose range, it is largely unknown whether this extrapolation is appropriate. The results of ongoing, large, epidemiologic studies are needed to determine if there is a risk of thyroid cancer from radiographs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-thyroid-cancer/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].

Virtually all of the previous indications for external radiation treatments in this range, eg, to shrink an &quot;enlarged&quot; thymus gland, have been abandoned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-thyroid-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, environmental exposures remain possible.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Childhood</strong> &ndash; Exposure of a cohort of children to low doses of iodine 131 (I-131) (estimated mean thyroid dose of 174 mGy) over a prolonged period of time (13 years as a result of releases from the Hanford nuclear facility) was not associated with an increased risk of thyroid disease in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-thyroid-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. On the other hand, children exposed to radiation, predominantly I-131, after the Chernobyl accident have developed thyroid cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-thyroid-cancer/abstract/15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-19</a>]. Additionally, among 1494 subjects aged 16 to 20 years who were exposed to I-131 fallout from the Chernobyl accident in utero, there was an increase in thyroid cancer; this is consistent with other data, but the risk estimate was based on only seven cases and was not statistically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-thyroid-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. It is not clear how far the Chernobyl experience can be extrapolated, because other factors, such as iodine deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-thyroid-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] and exposure to short-lived higher energy iodine isotopes, may come into play.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Adult</strong> &ndash; There is some evidence for a risk, albeit a small one, for adults. In adult survivors exposed to atomic bomb fallout, the risk appears to depend on the endpoint used for the estimate. For thyroid cancers &ge;10 mm, no statistically significant risk was evident [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-thyroid-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], but when the endpoint included small thyroid cancers found in surgical or autopsy specimens, a dose-response relationship was found [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-thyroid-cancer/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Further evidence of a risk from adult exposure comes from a study of 107 thyroid cancer cases and 423 controls among Chernobyl liquidators. The median thyroid dose was estimated to be 69 mGy, and the observed, excess relative risk (RR) at 100 mGy was 1.38 (95% CI 1.10-2.09) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-thyroid-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7803546\"><span class=\"h5\">High-dose exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The increasing success of treating children for a variety of malignancies, often using radiation, has resulted in studies of their risk for developing thyroid cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-thyroid-cancer/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Childhood</strong> &ndash; Studies in childhood cancer survivors have shown an increased risk of thyroid cancer after radiotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-thyroid-cancer/abstract/3,25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,25-27</a>]. As an example, in a pooled analysis of four observational studies of childhood cancer survivors (16,757 patients with 187 developing primary thyroid cancer), the risk of thyroid cancer after radiotherapy increased with radiation dose (RRs of 6.8 for 2 to 4 Gy and 14.9 for 5 to 9 Gy), plateaued between a dose of 10 and 30 Gy (RRs of 14.8 at 10 to 19 Gy and 15.2 at 20 to 29 Gy), and then declined with the highest doses (RRs 9.3 at 30 to 39 Gy and 5.1 at &gt;40 Gy), presumably due to cell destruction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F105234\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105234 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-thyroid-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The pooled excess absolute risk at 10 Gy was 12.4 per 10,000 patient-years. The risk increased significantly with decreasing age at exposure (RR 17.5 and 3.9 for age at exposure &lt;5 years and &gt;15 years, respectively). The risk of thyroid cancer does not appear to decrease over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-thyroid-cancer/abstract/3,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a study of nearly 18,000 British five-year survivors of childhood cancer, by the fourth decade of life, 1354 secondary malignancies had occurred and approximately 10 percent of them were thyroid cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-thyroid-cancer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Adult</strong> &ndash; Thyroid cancer following high-dose adult exposures have not been studied as extensively as childhood exposures.

In a study of patients treated with hematopoietic cell transplantation (including total body irradiation), compared with nonirradiated patients, the risk of developing a second cancer was higher among patients irradiated at &lt;30 years of age, whereas there was no difference between nonirradiated and irradiated patients when treatments were given at &gt;30 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-thyroid-cancer/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

Even though radiation can cause the entire range of possible mutations, those resulting in breakage and rejoining of the DNA chain are most important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-thyroid-cancer/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>These assumptions about radiation carcinogenesis are supported by work on the papillary thyroid cancers found in children in the aftermath of the nuclear power plant accident at Chernobyl in 1986 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-thyroid-cancer/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. In some papillary thyroid cancers, a translocation of the <em>RET</em> gene occurs, resulting in its constitutive expression and activation; this gene is not expressed in normal thyroid cells. The <em>RET</em> translocation has been found in a higher proportion of Chernobyl-related cancers than those not associated with radiation. Similarly, the frequency of <em>RET</em> translocations is increased in thyroid cancer cases associated with external radiation treatment for benign and malignant conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-thyroid-cancer/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. The specificity of <em>RET</em> and other translocations is illustrated by the observation that point mutations in the <em>BRAF</em> gene, the other common genetic activation in papillary thyroid cancer, are rarely found in radiation-related cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-thyroid-cancer/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oncogenes-and-tumor-suppressor-genes-in-thyroid-nodules-and-nonmedullary-thyroid-cancer#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in thyroid nodules and nonmedullary thyroid cancer&quot;, section on 'Papillary thyroid cancer'</a>).

In retrospect, this was in keeping with guidelines for its use as the thyroid radiation doses were almost universally below the threshold levels. In large part, this was due to keeping radioactive iodine out of the food chain, in contrast with Chernobyl. This substantial mitigation of the dose has led to a reconsideration of when and how to use potassium iodide following an accident [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-thyroid-cancer/abstract/75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,76</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H137003329\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

The predominant types of radiation are therapeutic external radiation for the treatment of cancer, historical use of external radiation to treat a wide variety of nonmalignant conditions, and exposure to nuclear fallout (from testing, accidents, or in Japanese survivors of atomic bombing). (See <a href=\"#H500633454\" class=\"local\">'Type of exposure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of thyroid cancer following irradiation is related to radiation dose (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F105234\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105234 \">figure 1</a>) and age (greater for children exposed early in life). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Magnitude of exposure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The increased risk of thyroid cancer resulting from radiation exposure during childhood persists for at least four decades. Thereafter, it begins to decline but has not reached baseline for as long as observations have been made. The intensity of surveillance for thyroid cancer in irradiated children depends upon risk factors, including radiation dose and age at exposure. Children with a history of therapeutic radiation exposure to the neck region (high dose) or environmental radiation exposure (low-dose exposures) require regular surveillance. (See <a href=\"#H1937510\" class=\"local\">'Surveillance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surveillance typically includes annual history and physical examination (all patients with therapeutic or environmental radiation exposure) and annual assessment of thyroid function tests (patients with high-dose exposure). Thyroid ultrasound is frequently used, based on estimation of risk factors (age of exposure and radiation dose), to detect nonpalpable nodules in this population. (See <a href=\"#H3614007\" class=\"local\">'General evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>All patients with thyroid disease who grew up in the era when radiation was used to treat nonmalignant conditions, chiefly during the 1940s and 1950s, should be asked about radiation exposure. For those who were exposed to low-dose radiation, the actual records usually are not available. Children exposed to therapeutic radiation for the treatment of cancer typically have medical records detailing the dose and site of radiation, as well as the age of radiation exposure. Cranial, nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, neck, cervical spine, upper chest, mantle, mediastinal, and total body irradiation can potentially increase the risk of thyroid cancer. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>All patients with a history of low- or high-dose radiation exposure to the thyroid should have a yearly thyroid examination. The thyroid-related physical examination is no different for radiation-exposed and nonexposed patients. (See <a href=\"#H351542153\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Thyroid function should be assessed in all patients with history of high-dose thyroid irradiation. For patients with radiation confined to the neck area alone, measurement of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is sufficient. For patients with a history of cranial or nasopharyngeal irradiation, who are at risk for both thyroid nodules and central hypothyroidism, we measure TSH and free thyroxine (T4). (See <a href=\"#H1828245\" class=\"local\">'Surveillance for functional thyroid abnormalities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Use of thyroid ultrasound to detect nonpalpable nodules in radiation-exposed patients is controversial. In the absence of data, the use of surveillance ultrasonography should be individualized, guided by an assessment of each patient's risk factors, including dose of radiation to the thyroid, when it is available, and young age of exposure, as well as a discussion regarding the harms and benefits of ultrasound screening. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Surveillance for structural thyroid abnormalities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If ultrasound surveillance is desired, the frequency of follow-up in patients without thyroid nodules or thyroid cancer depends upon their estimated risk and the clinical findings at the initial evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H3156250092\" class=\"local\">'Optimal timing and duration if ultrasound surveillance initiated'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with radiation-related thyroid nodules (discovered by palpation or through ultrasound screening), the clinical characteristics, evaluation, and management of radiation-related thyroid nodules are similar to those of thyroid nodules in nonexposed patients. (See <a href=\"#H3614208\" class=\"local\">'Detection of radiation-related thyroid nodules'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-and-treatment-of-thyroid-nodules\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to and treatment of thyroid nodules&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the event of a nuclear accident, potassium iodide tablets can decrease thyroid uptake of radioactive iodine. Potassium iodide can almost completely protect the thyroid if administered within 12 hours before radioactive iodine exposure; after an exposure, the degree of protection declines (80, 40, and 7 percent after 2, 8, and 24 hours, respectively). It can be taken once daily as long as high levels of environmental radioactive iodine persist.
