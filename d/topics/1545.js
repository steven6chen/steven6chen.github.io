Dosing guidelines for switching from one stimulant to another are provided in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61007\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61007 \">table 5</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2165451\" class=\"local\">'Treatment failure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Review of the initial presentation and diagnosis is warranted for children who do not respond to a second stimulant at the maximum dose. The following possibilities must be considered (see <a href=\"#H2165451\" class=\"local\">'Treatment failure'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lack of adherence to the medication regimen</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The possibility of medication diversion (eg, giving or selling the medication to others)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Whether the expectations are realistic</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Whether there is a comorbid psychiatric diagnosis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The maintenance stage begins once the optimal dose and frequency of medication have been determined. Continued monitoring of progress and adverse effects is necessary during the maintenance phase. The frequency of follow-up depends upon adherence, coexisting conditions, and the persistence of symptoms. During the maintenance phase, decisions regarding discontinuation of stimulant medication on weekends or school vacations must be made on a case by case basis. (See <a href=\"#H2007898749\" class=\"local\">'Maintenance therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The duration of pharmacologic therapy is highly individualized; ongoing evaluation of the risks and benefits of medication is necessary for each patient. After several years of medication, it is reasonable to offer children and adolescents who have had stable improvement in ADHD symptoms and target behaviors a trial off of medication to determine whether medication is still necessary. Such a trial is should be undertaken with close monitoring of core symptoms and function at home, school, and in the community.
