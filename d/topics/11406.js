(The Basics)</div><div><a href=\"authors.htm?path=patient-education\" class=\"contributors-marketing\">Written by the doctors and editors at UpToDate</a></div><div id=\"topicText\"><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5540860\"><span class=\"h1\">What is diabetes?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diabetes is a disorder that disrupts the way a person's body uses sugar. This causes sugar to build up in the blood. Diabetes is also called &quot;diabetes mellitus.&quot;</p><p>There are 2 types of diabetes. People with type 1 diabetes make little or no insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the body use sugar. People with type 2 diabetes sometimes also make too little insulin, but more often the problem is that their body doesn't respond to insulin.</p><p>Most children with diabetes have &quot;type 1 diabetes.&quot; But some children, especially overweight teenagers, have &quot;type 2 diabetes.&quot; This article discusses type 1 diabetes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5540875\"><span class=\"h1\">Who will take care of my child's diabetes?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different people will help take care of your child's diabetes. Your child's diabetes team will probably include a doctor, diabetes nurse, dietitian (food expert), and sometimes a mental health counselor and a pharmacist. Your child will see these people on a regular basis.</p><p>Your child's diabetes team will teach you how to take care of your child's diabetes at home. As your child grows older, he or she should learn more and more about how to take care of his or her diabetes.</p><p>At school, the school nurse and other staff will help take care of your child's diabetes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5540890\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my child need to take medicine?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Children with type 1 diabetes need to take a medicine called insulin every day. Insulin works to lower a person's blood sugar level.</p><p>Insulin usually comes in the form of a shot. Your child can also get insulin from an &quot;insulin pump.&quot; An insulin pump is a device that slowly delivers insulin to the body. The insulin goes from the pump, through a thin tube, and into the body through a tiny needle put under the skin.</p><p>There are different types of insulin. Your child will need several insulin doses each day. Your child's diabetes team will:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Teach you about the different types of insulin and when to use them</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Show you how to give your child an insulin shot or use an insulin pump</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Teach you how to choose your child's insulin dose &ndash; An insulin dose depends on different factors, such as what your child eats and how active he or she is.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5540905\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my child need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You will need to check your child's blood sugar level 4 or more times each day. To do this, you will use a device called a &quot;blood glucose meter.&quot; Your child's doctor or nurse will show you how to use your child's blood glucose meter.</p><p>Your child's doctor or nurse will also do a blood test called an &quot;A1C&quot; on a regular basis. This test shows what your child's average blood sugar level has been over the past 2 to 3 months.</p><p>Your child's doctor or nurse will look at the daily blood sugar levels and the A1C result to know:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How well-controlled your child's diabetes is</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If your child's treatment plan needs to be changed</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5540920\"><span class=\"h1\">Do I have to change my child's diet?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You might need to change what and how much your child eats, and when your child eats. It's important to know what, how much, and when your child eats to make sure that he or she gets the right amount of insulin.</p><p>Your diabetes team will work with you to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Help you plan healthy meals and snacks for your child</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Help you make a schedule for meals and snacks</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Teach you how to choose the correct insulin dose based on what your child eats and how much exercise he or she gets</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5540935\"><span class=\"h1\">What else can I do to help my child?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Learn about diabetes &ndash; The more you know about it, the better you can take care of it.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep your child's blood sugar levels under control &ndash; Levels that are very low or very high can cause serious problems. They need to be treated right away. Also, having high blood sugar levels over many years can damage the kidneys, eyes, nerves, and blood vessels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Learn the symptoms that could mean that your child's blood sugar level is too low or too high &ndash; These symptoms can be different, depending on a child's age.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Learn what to do when your child's blood sugar level is too low or too high &ndash; Know when to treat it at home and when to go to the hospital or call for an ambulance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have your child wear a medical bracelet or necklace so that others will know about their diabetes in case of an emergency.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5540950\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my child's life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most children with diabetes lead healthy and active lives. Over time, they learn how to take care of their diabetes on their own.</p><p>But having diabetes can make children feel sad or worried. If your child is sad or worried, have him or her talk to the doctor, nurse, or mental health counselor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5540965\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=type-1-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Type 1 diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=giving-your-child-insulin-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Giving your child insulin (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=checking-your-childs-blood-sugar-level-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Checking your child's blood sugar level (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=keeping-your-childs-blood-sugar-under-control-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Keeping your child's blood sugar under control (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=carb-counting-for-children-with-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Carb counting for children with diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-diabetes-in-school-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing diabetes in school (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetes-and-diet-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diabetes and diet (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-abcs-of-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: The ABCs of diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=using-insulin-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Using insulin (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemoglobin-a1c-tests-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hemoglobin A1C tests (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetes-mellitus-type-1-insulin-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Diabetes mellitus type 1: Insulin treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose-in-diabetes-mellitus-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Self-monitoring of blood glucose in diabetes mellitus (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=type-1-diabetes-mellitus-and-diet-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Type 1 diabetes mellitus and diet (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
