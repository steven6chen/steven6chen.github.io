Hybrid lesions have also been described, suggesting these masses represent a spectrum of abnormalities. </p><p>Widespread use of prenatal ultrasonography has led to increased prenatal diagnosis of these disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-pulmonary-airway-malformation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, both prenatal ultrasound and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging have improved our understanding of their natural history. Ultrasound evaluation is sensitive for the diagnosis of many prenatal lung lesions, but has low specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-pulmonary-airway-malformation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Fetal MR imaging improves evaluation of pulmonary anatomy, which can help to confirm or exclude the suspected diagnosis, and provides additional information useful for counseling and obstetrical management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-pulmonary-airway-malformation/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. However, a definitive diagnosis is usually not possible without surgical resection and histopathological evaluation.</p><p>CPAM is one of the most common lung lesions diagnosed prenatally (59 percent of prenatal lung lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-pulmonary-airway-malformation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]), although the birth prevalence is quite low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-pulmonary-airway-malformation/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. It is usually sporadic and isolated, and has no familial recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-pulmonary-airway-malformation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Assessment of lung parenchyma sonographically can be limited due to maternal obesity, oligohydramnios, overlying ribs, and fetal lie; MR is less limited by these factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1505780951\"><span class=\"h3\">Normal lung: ultrasound findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In axial images, the normal fetal chest is oval or round, with the heart positioned in the anterior half of the left chest and bordered by lung parenchyma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F74495%7EOBGYN%2F63320\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74495 graphicRef63320 \">image 1A-B</a>). Inferiorly, the diaphragms are dome-shaped and hypoechoic. Lung parenchyma appears homogeneous and slightly hyperechogenic compared with the fetal liver, and its echogenicity increases with gestational age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-pulmonary-airway-malformation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The fetal airway is not well delineated on ultrasound.</p><p>Fetal lung volume increases with gestational age with the right lung typically measuring 56 percent of total lung volume. Three-dimensional (3D) and four-dimensional (4D) ultrasound imaging appear to be more useful than two-dimensional ultrasound for estimating lung volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-pulmonary-airway-malformation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4034589237\"><span class=\"h3\">Normal lung: magnetic resonance imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On MR, the normal fetal lung has a homogeneously moderate high signal on T2w (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F74495\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74495 \">image 1A</a>) chest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-pulmonary-airway-malformation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The T2 signal increases with increased number of alveoli and production of alveolar fluid and decreases in signal with T1w [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-pulmonary-airway-malformation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. When normal lung is compressed by either a lung mass or an extraparenchymal lesion, it appears slightly hypointense compared to noncompressed normal lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-pulmonary-airway-malformation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The liver, mediastinal structures, and lung parenchyma are easily differentiated by MR. Compared with adjacent lung, the liver has a lower signal on T2w and higher signal on T1w. The fetal airway can be seen well due to fluid within the larynx, trachea, and bronchi. The thymus is homogeneous and has a higher signal than heart, which appears as a dark flow void. Use of MR for volumetric lung measurements is promising, but investigational.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15360242\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasound findings in CPAM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prenatal diagnosis of CPAM is suggested by the presence of macrocysts or a solid-appearing mass in the fetal chest on ultrasound examination. These masses are most commonly identified in the second trimester. </p><p>In the second trimester, macrocysts (&gt;5 mm) are anechoic and usually surrounded by hyperechogenic lung parenchyma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F64147\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64147 \">image 2</a>). Microcystic lesions (cysts under &lt;5 mm) appear as a homogeneous, solid mass that is hyperechogenic compared with the adjacent normal lung parenchyma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F77848\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77848 \">image 3</a>). Mixed lesions also occur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71008\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef71008 \">image 4</a>) and are the second most common congenital lung lesion after CPAM, representing 38 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-pulmonary-airway-malformation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. As gestational age increases, microcystic lesions become more difficult to visualize due to increased echogenicity of surrounding normal lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-pulmonary-airway-malformation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Shadowing from overlying ribs also makes assessment of the mass more difficult in the third trimester.</p><p>The lesion develops in the right and left lungs with equal frequency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-pulmonary-airway-malformation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]; bilateral lung involvement is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-pulmonary-airway-malformation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Only one lobe is involved in 85 to 95 percent of cases and the lower lobe is the most common site, but any lobe can be affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-pulmonary-airway-malformation/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>Large lesions can cause mediastinal shift to the contralateral side, possibly with rotation of the heart. Particular attention should be paid to mediastinal shift since a severe shift resulting in compression of the inferior vena cava and heart can lead to hydrops(ie, two or more of the following: pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, skin edema [thickening], ascites, polyhydramnios) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F63018\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63018 \">image 5</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5019961\" class=\"local\">'Hydropic fetuses'</a> below.)</p><p>The esophagus can become compressed and obstructed, resulting in dilatation of the proximal esophagus, a small stomach, and polyhydramnios. The ipsilateral diaphragm may be flattened. </p><p>CPAM has a connection to the tracheobronchial tree (in contrast to BPS). On color and power Doppler, the arterial supply and venous drainage can be seen connected to the normal pulmonary circulation, although vascular connections to the systemic circulation have been reported. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1604832810\"><span class=\"h2\">Classification of CPAM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prenatally, CPAM is classified as macrocystic (26 percent) or microcystic (74 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-pulmonary-airway-malformation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] based on ultrasound appearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-pulmonary-airway-malformation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The higher incidence of microcystic versus macrocystic lesions prenatally, in contrast to postnatally, is likely due to the fact that macrocystic lesions are more likely to be symptomatic postnatally, resulting in a higher reported incidence in postnatal series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-pulmonary-airway-malformation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Postnatally, CPAM is classified into five types (0, 1, 2, 3, and 4) depending on pathologic characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-pulmonary-airway-malformation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This more refined classification system, although prognostically useful postnatally, is less useful prenatally since tissue is not available for histological analysis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2716307286\"><span class=\"h1\">PRENATAL FETAL EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1260795141\"><span class=\"h2\">Quantitative measurements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Quantitative evaluation helps predict the prenatal course of the disease (see <a href=\"#H5019798\" class=\"local\">'Prenatal course'</a> below) and should include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Congenital pulmonary airway malformation volume ratio (CVR) &ndash; Obtained by calculating the volume of the lung mass using the formula for the volume of an oval and normalizing it by gestational age.

Macrocysts are high signal on T2w and are usually surrounded by abnormal hyperintense lung parenchyma, while microcystic masses are homogeneously hyperintense on T2w. We suggest fetal MR to better delineate abnormal and normal anatomy when the entire lung is involved by the mass, in the presence of hydrops or bilateral lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-pulmonary-airway-malformation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], and when the diagnosis is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-pulmonary-airway-malformation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The optimal timing of fetal MRI to assess suspected bronchopulmonary malformations (BPM) is unclear. In one series, two fetal MRIs were performed: early (20 to 26 weeks of gestation) and late (&gt;32 weeks of gestation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-pulmonary-airway-malformation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The type of BPM was concordant with postnatal diagnosis in 19 of 26 cases (73 percent) with early MRI versus 22 of 26 cases (85 percent) with late MRI. The authors suggested that the addition of a later MRI may improve clinical management and could delay or reduce postnatal imaging.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Color and power Doppler</strong> &ndash; Color and power Doppler imaging of the pulmonary vasculature can also be helpful in differential diagnosis.

In contrast to CPAM, there is no communication with the tracheobronchial tree. BPS has anomalous systemic feeding and draining vessels, which can often be identified by color and power Doppler imaging, whereas blood flow to CPAM is the normal pulmonary vasculature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-pulmonary-airway-malformation/abstract/5,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,26</a>].

This diagnosis can be difficult to differentiate from microcystic CPAM and BPS prenatally. The presence of normal pulmonary vascularity excludes BPS and the lack of cysts excludes CPAM.

Mediastinal and cardiac deviation may be the only hint that a congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is present in the occasional cases where the stomach remains infradiaphragmatic. When the stomach is herniated into the hemithorax, nonvisualization of stomach bubble within the abdomen is helpful for making the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-pulmonary-airway-malformation/abstract/15,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,26</a>].

Deviation of the umbilical portion of the portal vein suggests liver herniation into the thorax, and the use of the umbilical vein ratio can help in the ultrasound diagnosis of subtle cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-pulmonary-airway-malformation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. MR is particularly useful in assessing the amount of liver herniation and delineation of meconium filled small and large bowel in the chest. Meconium is dark on T2 and bright on T1, while liver is higher signal on T1w and intermediate signal on T2w, thus easily differentiated from adjacent lung.

Aberrant pulmonary budding off the foregut is present. Most CHAOS lesions also have a connection with the esophagus.

After two sessions one week apart, tumor size decreased. Complete resolution of fetal hydrops was observed in four of seven cases but only two fetuses survived, possibly because the intervention was initiated when the fetus was already preterminal.

(See <a href=\"#H5019266\" class=\"local\">'Prenatal diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Color and power Doppler imaging of the pulmonary vasculature can also be helpful in differential diagnosis. Blood supply from the systemic circulation suggests pulmonary sequestration or a hybrid lesion. (See <a href=\"#H5019419\" class=\"local\">'Adjunctive imaging'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5019524\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is used to better delineate abnormal and normal anatomy when the entire lung is involved by the mass, in the presence of hydrops or bilateral lesions, and when the diagnosis is uncertain. Echocardiography is useful to assess for congenital heart disease, impending hydrops, and prognosis. (See <a href=\"#H5019419\" class=\"local\">'Adjunctive imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most CPAMs demonstrate rapid progressive growth from about weeks 20 to 26 of gestation, peaking at about 25 weeks, and then growth plateaus and often regresses. Prenatal course can be predicted by quantitative measurements, such as the congenital pulmonary airway malformation volume ratio (CVR), mass-to-thorax ratio (MTR), and observed to expected lung-to-head ratio. (See <a href=\"#H5019798\" class=\"local\">'Prenatal course'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1260795141\" class=\"local\">'Quantitative measurements'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the absence of hydrops, the prognosis is good with reported live birth rates &ge;95 percent. Up to one-third of fetuses with CPAM develop hydrops due to hemodynamic alterations from vena cava obstruction and cardiac <span class=\"nowrap\">displacement/compression;</span> mortality is high in these fetuses. However, if hydrops has not developed by about 28 weeks, it is unlikely to develop since CPAM growth plateaus by the end of the second trimester, and the fetal thorax continues to increase. (See <a href=\"#H5019798\" class=\"local\">'Prenatal course'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5019961\" class=\"local\">'Hydropic fetuses'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A CPAM volume ratio (CVR) &ge;1.6 predicts the development of hydrops. The frequency depends on underlying factors and is 17 percent in low risk lesions versus 75 percent in high risk lesions (large lesions, lesions that persist into the third trimester, and microcystic lesions). (See <a href=\"#H5019961\" class=\"local\">'Hydropic fetuses'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancies should be followed with serial ultrasound examinations to assess change in size of the lung mass, change in CVR, and development of polyhydramnios and hydrops. (See <a href=\"#H5020104\" class=\"local\">'Prenatal management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of hydrops is a sign for impending fetal demise and is an indication for fetal intervention. For fetuses over 32 weeks of gestation, we suggest delivery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For gestations between 20 and 32 weeks, the best approach depends on the type of anomaly (macro- versus microcystic). Drainage procedures are used for CPAMS with dominant cysts, while solid masses are treated by resection or ablation. Karyotype analysis is recommended prior to initiating fetal therapy. (See <a href=\"#H5020104\" class=\"local\">'Prenatal management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In uncontrolled studies, maternal steroid administration has been associated with reversal of hydrops. However, it is possible that fetal thoracic growth <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> CPAM regression rather than the steroids accounted for resolution of hydrops. As steroids are the only potential medical treatment of microcystic CPAM that has been reported, administration of one course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">betamethasone</a> is not unreasonable.
