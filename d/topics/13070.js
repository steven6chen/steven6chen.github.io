Pathogenesis of <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em> is the area of greatest study, since this species causes the most severe clinical disease (other species include <em>P. ovale</em>, <em>P. vivax</em>, <em>P. malariae</em>, and <em>P. knowlesi</em>). <em>P. knowlesi</em> malaria can also cause life-threatening illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-malaria/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], and, although rare, severe illness (including severe respiratory disease and anemia) and death due to <em>P. vivax</em> have been reported.</p><p>Issues related to the pathogenesis of malaria will be reviewed here. Issues related to epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment are discussed in detail separately.

The sporozoites travel from the salivary glands of the mosquito through the bloodstream of the host to the liver, where they invade hepatocytes. These cells divide many 1000-fold until mature tissue schizonts are formed, each containing thousands of daughter merozoites. This exoerythrocytic stage is asymptomatic.</p><p>The liver schizonts rupture after 6 to 30 days; 98 percent of patients experience liver schizogony by 90 days (there is typically a longer liver phase in species other than <em>P. falciparum</em>). This event releases thousands of merozoites into the bloodstream, where they invade red blood cells (the erythrocytic or asexual stage). <em>P. falciparum</em> may invade any red cell, while <em>P. vivax</em> and <em>P. ovale</em> prefer the younger, slightly larger reticulocytes. The merozoites mature successively from ring forms to trophozoites to mature schizonts (asexual forms) over 24 hours (<em>P. knowlesi</em>), 48 hours (<em>P. vivax</em>, <em>P. ovale</em>, <em>P. falciparum</em>), or 72 hours (<em>P. malariae</em>). Within red blood cells, the parasites digest hemoglobin. As hemoglobin is digested, the toxic metabolite hemozoin (a polarizable crystal) is formed and isolated in the parasite's food vacuole.</p><p>The intracellular parasites modify the erythrocyte in several ways. They derive energy from anaerobic glycolysis of glucose to lactic acid, which may contribute to clinical manifestations of hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-malaria/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Parasites reduce red cell membrane deformability, resulting in hemolysis and accelerated splenic clearance, which may contribute to anemia. Alterations to uninfected red blood cells, such as the addition of <em>P. falciparum</em> glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) to the membrane, may play a role in increased clearance of uninfected cells and contribute to anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-malaria/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-in-malaria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anemia in malaria&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Ultimately, new daughter merozoites are released from the schizont stage of infected erythrocytes. The remnants of cell membrane and the hemozoin crystal are phagocytized by circulating macrophages, an important stimulus in the activation of the immune cascade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-malaria/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. In addition, free heme is released into the peripheral blood, an important stimulus for endothelial activation; endothelial cell damage also occurs in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-malaria/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p>Red cell lysis stimulates release of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF). TNF suppresses hematopoiesis, which also contributes to the anemia. The liver and spleen enlarge over time; the spleen may become massively enlarged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-malaria/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Thrombocytopenia is caused by a combination of hypersplenism (ie, increased splenic sequestration and decreased platelet survival time) and, in the case of <em>P. falciparum</em>, deposition of platelets adjacent to parasite microvascular sequestration and fibrin thrombi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-malaria/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Coagulation'</a> below.)</p><p>Merozoites continue the asexual cycle and infect new red cells, although a few differentiate into male or female gametocytes (sexual forms), which cause no symptoms. These gametocyte-committed parasites leave the bloodstream and develop in the bone marrow over three to four days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-malaria/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Mature male and female gametocytes then circulate in the bloodstream until they are ingested by a blood-feeding anopheline mosquito. These sexual forms complete their life cycle within the midgut of the <em>Anopheles</em> mosquito (including an ookinete and oocyst stage) with development into sporozoites, which migrate to the salivary glands of the mosquito; from there, they can infect another human through another bite.</p><p>In the setting of <em>P. vivax</em> and <em>P. ovale</em> infection, some parasites remain dormant in the liver as hypnozoites and can cause late relapse by reactivating after many months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-malaria/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In the setting of <em>P. falciparum</em> and <em>P. malariae</em> infection, hypnozoite parasites do not develop in the liver. However, <em>P. malariae</em> can cause very late relapse due to subpatent infection that can become symptomatic years to decades later. In addition, the chronic infection of <em>P. malariae </em>may result in immune complex formation and deposition leading to renal damage and failure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic diversity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surveys of the <em>P. falciparum</em> genome from different geographic regions have demonstrated remarkable genetic diversity, particularly in surface antigens. The parasite genome is much more diverse than the human genome; single nucleotide polymorphisms, <span class=\"nowrap\">insertions/deletions,</span> and microsatellites are very common in particular genes (genes that are under immune selection, for example) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-malaria/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].</p><p>Using these polymorphisms as markers in genome-wide association studies allows identification of the source of clinical and experimental phenotypes of the parasites, improving understanding of pathogenesis and potential for development of new therapies. Genetic diversity can also be used as a tool to measure effective population size and the effects of interventions on a given population.</p><p>Variation in gene copy number among genes known to be involved in metabolic pathways may influence drug susceptibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-malaria/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Comprehensive genetic mapping will enable further identification of genes mediating drug resistance as well as potential vaccine targets.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Microvascular disease and sequestration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All species of <em>Plasmodium</em> in human infections are likely cytoadherent to human cell surfaces at some point during the life cycle but, for all species but <em>P. falciparum</em>, this period of sequestration is very short: For <em>P. falciparum</em>, it is more than half of the 48-hour life cycle. Cytoadherence to human cell surfaces is an important component of <em>P. falciparum</em> pathogenesis. As <em>P. falciparum</em> parasites mature from rings to trophozoites within red blood cells, they induce the formation of sticky knobs on the surface of erythrocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-malaria/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. The knobs are composed of a combination of parasite-produced proteins including <em>P. falciparum</em> erythrocyte membrane protein-1 (PfEMP-1, the product of <em>var</em> gene expression and proposed primary cytoadherence factor), KAHRP, PfEMP-2, and RESA as well as human proteins including spectrin, actin, and band 4.1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-malaria/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. Each <em>P. falciparum </em>parasite has &ge;60 different <em>var</em> genes; of these, one protein product is present in individual parasites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-malaria/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>The knobs bind to receptors on a variety of cell types in capillaries and venules, including endothelial cells. Notable human receptors include ICAM-1 and ePCR (vascular endothelium), CD36 (on endothelium and platelets), and CSA (in the placenta); a variety of other binding interactions have also been elucidated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-malaria/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>]. Endothelial binding leads to sequestration of infected red cells within these small vessels (thereby removing parasites from the peripheral circulation during a prolonged period of the life cycle). This leads to partial blood flow obstruction, endothelial barrier breakdown, and inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-malaria/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Sequestration can be demonstrated in any organ of a patient infected with <em>P. falciparum</em>. The most catastrophic clinical manifestation of sequestration results in cerebral malaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-malaria/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Renal failure in the setting of malaria may occur in part as a result of mechanical obstruction by infected erythrocytes; immune-mediated glomerular pathology and fluid loss due to alterations in the renal microcirculation also probably contribute to renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-malaria/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Rosetting can occur when infected red cells stick to uninfected red cells and form rosettes that block the microcirculation and contribute to microvascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-malaria/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Rosetting is mediated by an interaction between PfEMP-1 within knobs and receptors on the surface of uninfected red cells, such as complement-receptor 1 (CR1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-malaria/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Parasite biomass</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vascular beds harboring sequestered parasites allow accumulation of high levels of parasite biomass in the host. HRP-2 (a <em>P. falciparum</em> antigen expressed on the erythrocyte membrane) can be used as an indirect measure of parasite biomass both in the circulation and sequestered in the microvasculature. The concentration of this antigen has been observed to correlate with severity of clinical disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-malaria/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Cytokines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The interaction between host endothelium and immune cells with malaria parasites is complex and not fully understood. The &quot;cytokine storm&quot; hypothesis suggests that, in the setting of severe malaria, damaging cytokines and small molecules become unregulated and lead to a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)-like state with high circulating levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and nitric oxide. However, evidence of direct correlation between severe malaria and the activity of these markers is limited.</p><p>Some markers, such as the acute phase reactant C-reactive protein (CRP), correlate directly with parasitemia. Cytokines TNF, lymphotoxin, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-18, and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 are consistently elevated in the setting of malaria. However, it is not clear whether these precede or follow clinical markers of severe infection.</p><p>Molecular evidence for endothelial and tissue damage includes elevated levels of lactate, CK-MB, myoglobin, and angiopoietin-2 as well as increased soluble <span class=\"nowrap\">ligands/receptors</span> (eg, sELAM-1, sICAM-1, sTNF-R1, sTNF-R2, sVCAM-1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-malaria/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Microparticles (small circulating bodies released from the surface of human cells) are another interesting component of pathogenesis; more data are needed to understand their exact role.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Coagulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initiation of tissue factor production in the coagulation cascade has been proposed as a unifying mechanism of pathogenesis in severe malaria, based on the following observations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-malaria/abstract/8,34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,34-36</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thrombocytopenia is a common feature of severe malaria; it may also observed in uncomplicated malaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-malaria/abstract/8,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Activation of the coagulation cascade in the absence of overt bleeding (eg, elevated D-dimer and thrombin-antithrombin complexes with normal prothrombin time and thromboplastin time) is also common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-malaria/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autopsies of patients with cerebral malaria frequently demonstrate fibrin microthrombi admixed with platelets in the cerebral vasculature (as well as other organs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-malaria/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Nitric oxide</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Low nitric oxide, low arginine (the precursor of nitric oxide), and elevated arginase activity in peripheral blood have been observed in severe malaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-malaria/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Metabolic studies have demonstrated that the parasite's arginase enzyme (which converts arginine to ornithine) may contribute to hypoargininemia in severely ill patients, thus shutting down nitric oxide production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-malaria/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Children with nitric oxide depletion due to intravascular hemolysis in the setting of malaria subsequently develop pulmonary hypertension and myocardial wall stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-malaria/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Replenishment of nitric oxide via peripheral arginine has been suggested as a possible treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-malaria/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">THE HOST</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several genetic polymorphisms and mutations appear to influence the severity of malaria infection; examples are summarized in the Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F55135\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55135 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Hemoglobin and red cell antigens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemoglobin and red cell antigens can confer variable protection against malaria.

Absence of the Duffy antigen on red cells (largely observed in individuals from West and sub-Saharan Africa) is protective for <em>P. vivax</em> malaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-malaria/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. However, cases of <em>P. vivax</em> in Duffy-negative individuals have been identified in Brazil and in Kenya, suggesting that <em>P. vivax</em> has evolved alternate red blood cell invasion pathways to invade Duffy-negative red cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-malaria/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is strong evidence that sickle cell genetic alterations evolved in part because of the survival advantage against lethal <em>P. falciparum</em> infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-malaria/abstract/44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-46</a>]. Children with HbAS have a significantly lower risk of <em>P. falciparum</em> malaria, lower parasite densities, and lower rates of hospital admissions than children with HbAA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-malaria/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Possible mechanisms are discussed in detail separately.

In a family living in the United States in which two children had sickle cell anemia and three had sickle cell trait, travel to an endemic region without chemoprophylaxis led to hemolytic crisis in three of the children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-malaria/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Thalassemia may indirectly protect against <em>P. falciparum</em> infection by mediating increased susceptibility to nonlethal <em>P. vivax</em>, particularly in young children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-malaria/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Red blood cells in individuals with thalassemia appear to be susceptible to <em>P. falciparum</em> invasion but are associated with significantly reduced parasite multiplication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-malaria/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. This may be due to the variable degree of persistence of hemoglobin F, which is relatively resistant to hemoglobin digestion by malarial hemoglobinases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-malaria/abstract/50,53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,53,54</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The <em>Plasmodium</em> life cycle consists of an exoerythrocytic (asymptomatic) stage and erythrocytic (symptomatic) stage. <em>Plasmodium</em> sporozoites are transmitted by the bite of an infected anopheline mosquito. The sporozoites invade hepatocytes, which divide until schizonts are formed containing thousands of daughter merozoites. These rupture and release merozoites into the bloodstream, where they invade red blood cells. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Life cycle'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intracellular parasites alter the red cell, digesting hemoglobin to form hemozoin and making the membrane less deformable, resulting in hemolysis or splenic clearance. The merozoites invade the red cell and mature to ring forms, trophozoites, and schizonts. Schizonts rupture and release new daughter merozoites. This release can result in proinflammatory cytokines response including tumor necrosis factor. Most released merozoites infect new red cells; a few differentiate into gametocytes, which circulate until they are ingested by a mosquito to continue the transmission cycle. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Life cycle'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Cytokines'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endothelial binding of infected red cells leads to sequestration of infected red cells within small vessels (thereby removing parasites from the peripheral circulation during a prolonged period of the life cycle). This can lead to partial blood flow obstruction, endothelial barrier breakdown, and inflammation. Mechanisms of microvascular disease include formation of sticky knobs on the cell surface and rosetting (eg, adherence of infected red cells to uninfected cells, forming rosettes that clog the microcirculation). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Microvascular disease and sequestration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several human genetic polymorphisms and mutations have been observed to influence the severity of malaria infection, particularly hemoglobin and red cell antigens. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Genetic factors'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Protection against malaria in the hemoglobinopathies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-in-malaria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anemia in malaria&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals living in endemic areas develop partial immunity to malaria following repeated infections; they develop protection from severe disease and can be asymptomatic despite infection. The degree of protective immunity appears to be proportional to transmission intensity. The cellular immune response consists of a variety of cytokines including interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor.
