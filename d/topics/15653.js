Youth who self-identify as heterosexual are often referred to as straight.

Some adolescents prefer the terms &quot;mostly heterosexual&quot; or &quot;mostly homosexual,&quot; to reflect their feeling of being between categories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-minority-youth-epidemiology-and-health-concerns/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Others may avoid categorization, preferring more diffuse terminology such as queer, pansexual, or fluid regarding their sexuality.</p><p><strong>Sexual behavior</strong> &ndash; Sexual behavior refers to particular sexual activities and incorporates the gender(s) of sexual partners. Sexual attraction and identity correlate closely, but not completely, with reports of sexual behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-minority-youth-epidemiology-and-health-concerns/abstract/6-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-11</a>]. Youth who self-identify as heterosexual may engage in sexual activity with same-sex partners; youth who self-identify as homosexual may remain sexually inexperienced.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adolescent-sexuality\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adolescent sexuality&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Sexual exploration, experimentation, and discovery are part of the normal process of incorporating sexuality into one's sexual identity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-minority-youth-epidemiology-and-health-concerns/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. Before puberty, many children experiment with cross-gender play and expression. Cross-gender interests and expression in the prepubertal years are neither necessarily nor predictably associated with adolescent or adult sexual orientation. However, gender nonconforming prepubertal children more often identify as gay or lesbian than transgender in adolescence and adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-minority-youth-epidemiology-and-health-concerns/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>].

Defining one's sexual orientation occurs over time. First awareness of same-sex attraction has been described as early as age 9 for boys and 10 for girls, but sexual minority youth may self-identify orientation at later ages than heterosexual peers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-minority-youth-epidemiology-and-health-concerns/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. </p><p>Formation of sexual identity among youth may be fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-minority-youth-epidemiology-and-health-concerns/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Adolescent sexual identity and self-identified orientation does not necessarily correlate with sexual behaviors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-minority-youth-epidemiology-and-health-concerns/abstract/6-11,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-11,25</a>]. Teens may have same-sex attractions and fantasies but not identify as homosexual; they may identify as homosexual but remain sexually inexperienced; or they may identify as heterosexual, but engage in same sex behaviors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adolescent-sexuality#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adolescent sexuality&quot;, section on 'Adolescent development'</a>.)</p><p>Strong family and societal expectations may influence the experience and expression of gender and sexuality in children and adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-minority-youth-epidemiology-and-health-concerns/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Some parents and families may try to redirect nonconforming expression and same-sex attractions, identity, or behavior to fit into heteronormative social parameters (ie, those that view opposite-sex relationships as the only &quot;normal&quot; relationships in society) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-minority-youth-epidemiology-and-health-concerns/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Peer pressure may lead teens to behaviors that have little to do with attraction. Externalized and internalized sexual prejudice (also known as &quot;homophobia&quot; or &quot;homonegativity&quot;) may lead teens to avoid sexual activity altogether, adopt heterosexual activity, or mistreat others who they perceive as homosexual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-minority-youth-epidemiology-and-health-concerns/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

These health disparities are not intrinsic to sexual minority status, but appear to be related to stigmatization and lack of acceptance of specific sexual behaviors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-minority-youth-epidemiology-and-health-concerns/abstract/40-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1043274843\"><span class=\"h2\">Stigmatization and minority stress</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sexual minority youth may be stigmatized and marginalized by individuals or in communities and cultures that are dismissive, openly rejecting, or hostile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-minority-youth-epidemiology-and-health-concerns/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

In surveys of sexual minority young adults, high levels of family rejection during adolescence was associated with suicidality, depression, illegal drug use, and engaging in unprotected sex; family acceptance was associated with greater self-esteem and social support, and decreased depression, substance abuse, and suicidality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-minority-youth-epidemiology-and-health-concerns/abstract/50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52</a>]. Other surveys found an association between structural stigma at the state-level (eg, lack of nondiscrimination policies for sexual minority status) and disparities in drug and cigarette use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-minority-youth-epidemiology-and-health-concerns/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>].</p><p>Minority stress models propose that being a minority is linked to bias, discrimination, and lack of support that can lead to stress, anxiety, and depression, which contribute to adverse long-term psychosocial and health outcomes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F95318\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef95318 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-minority-youth-epidemiology-and-health-concerns/abstract/33,55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,55-57</a>].

The process of coming out can be life-long, as youth meet new people and experience new social situations. Sexual minority youth typically first disclose to a friend [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-minority-youth-epidemiology-and-health-concerns/abstract/166\" class=\"abstract_t\">166</a>].

Discussions about disclosure should include the timing, approach, and potential repercussions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F95291\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95291 \">table 6</a>).

Reactions to disclosure (positive or negative) are not always predictable.

The safety of the youth is paramount. There are particular situations where it may not be safe, helpful, or advisable to disclose. Some youth have significant and real concerns regarding physical safety or abuse from a parent or guardian due to sexual minority status. Others may not be physically unsafe, but may be rejected, emotionally and verbally abused, or coerced financially. Dependence on parents for housing, schooling, food, and other expenses is a real concern for many youth. If a youth is uncertain how a parent or guardian will react, it may be safer to wait to disclose until the youth is in a more independent or supported position. Disproportionate numbers of homeless youth are sexual minorities, suggesting that many were rejected or not safe at home in their asserted sexual identity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-minority-youth-epidemiology-and-health-concerns/abstract/127,169,170\" class=\"abstract_t\">127,169,170</a>].

Sexual identity is an individual's assessment of his or her sexual orientation. It is best defined by the individual adolescent; many avoid discreet labels. (See <a href=\"#H365247824\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The term &quot;sexual minority&quot; encompasses a variety of gender and sexual identities and expressions that differ from cultural norms. In this topic, we focus on youth who identify themselves as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or unsure of their sexual identity, who avoid discrete sexual orientation labels, and who have had sexual contact with persons of the same sex or persons of both sexes. (See <a href=\"#H365247824\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adolescents explore their emerging sexuality through attractions, fantasies, and behaviors. Adolescent sexual identity and self-identified orientation does not necessarily correlate with sexual behaviors. (See <a href=\"#H350964255\" class=\"local\">'Developmental perspective'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In large surveys, 4 to 7 percent of high school youth report same-sex attractions or behaviors. (See <a href=\"#H365248474\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of sexual minority youth are healthy and well adjusted. However, compared with heterosexual peers, sexual minority youth are at increased risk of adverse psychosocial and health outcomes, including victimization, depression, suicide, substance use, homelessness, sexually transmitted infections, and unplanned pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H1043274770\" class=\"local\">'Potential psychosocial and health concerns'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adverse psychosocial and health outcomes may be related to stigmatization and lack of acceptance by individuals, communities, and cultures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F95318\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef95318 \">figure 2</a>). Factors that may counteract stigmatization include acceptance, competence, increased self-esteem, strong connections to family and school, caring adult role models, and involvement in a community. (See <a href=\"#H1043274843\" class=\"local\">'Stigmatization and minority stress'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1141481533\" class=\"local\">'Potential protective factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Healthcare providers can support sexual minority youth by normalizing sexuality throughout childhood; early identification of gender or sexual nonconformity and associated psychosocial and health concerns (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F95292\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95292 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F95294\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95294 \">table 3</a>); helping parents support their child; helping the youth with decisions about disclosure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F95291\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95291 \">table 6</a>), advocating for schools that provide safety for sexual minority youth, and providing educational and support resources to the sexual minority youth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F95288\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95288 \">table 7</a>) and his or her family (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F95287\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95287 \">table 5</a>).
