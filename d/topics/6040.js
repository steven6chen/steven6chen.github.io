These ectopic endometrial implants are typically located in the pelvis but can occur throughout the body. Urinary tract endometriosis refers to endometriotic implants of the bladder, ureter, kidney, and urethra. In women with urinary tract endometriosis, the bladder and ureter are most commonly affected.</p><p>This topic will review the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of endometriosis of the bladder and ureter.

General theories of endometriosis include retrograde menstruation, lymphatic or hematogenous dissemination of endometrial cells, coelomic metaplasia, spread of endometrium-derived <span class=\"nowrap\">stem/progenitor</span> cells, and altered genetic or immune factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-of-the-bladder-and-ureter/abstract/1-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-7</a>]. Additionally, endometriosis appears to be iatrogenic in some women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-adenomyosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine adenomyosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H54442759\" class=\"local\">'Special populations'</a> below.)</p><p>Anatomic structures of the pelvis may provide sheltered pockets that protect ectopic endometrial cells from the usual peritoneal clearance mechanisms and allow endometrial implants to develop [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-of-the-bladder-and-ureter/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This shelter effect may explain why bladder endometriosis is not typically seen in women with a retroverted uterus, as these women do not have a protected anterior space to facilitate growth of ectopic endometrial cells. Similarly, the sigmoid colon creates a shelter on the left side of the pelvis, which may explain why ureteral endometriosis is found more frequently on the left [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-of-the-bladder-and-ureter/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29778329\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Determining the prevalence of urinary tract endometriosis (including both bladder and ureteral endometriosis) in the general population is challenging because up to 50 percent of women with endometriosis may be asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-of-the-bladder-and-ureter/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Of women diagnosed with pelvic endometriosis, approximately 1 percent have urinary tract endometriosis, most commonly bladder endometriosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-of-the-bladder-and-ureter/abstract/7,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,12</a>]. Endometriosis of the ureter is rare, with an estimated prevalence of 0.1 percent.

Urinary incontinence is rare (one case reported) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-of-the-bladder-and-ureter/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Women are typically diagnosed with endometriosis, including bladder endometriosis, during their reproductive years, with a mean age of diagnosis of 33 years in one study of nearly 700 women with endometriosis (range of 20 to 57 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-of-the-bladder-and-ureter/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

However, this symptom constellation is more likely to reflect bladder endometriosis in women with known endometriosis compared with women who present with isolated urinary tract complaints. Rarely, bladder endometriosis can be asymptomatic and incidentally diagnosed at the time of a procedure for a different indication. The frequency of incidentally diagnosed bladder endometriosis is not known.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Known endometriosis</strong> &ndash; In women with previously diagnosed pelvic endometriosis, dysuria is the most common presenting symptom of bladder endometriosis, although urinary frequency and urinary urgency can still occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-of-the-bladder-and-ureter/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In one study of 213 women with deeply infiltrating endometriosis, dysuria occurred in nearly 70 percent of women with confirmed bladder endometriosis but only in 6 percent of women without bladder involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-of-the-bladder-and-ureter/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Symptoms of bladder endometriosis may worsen with menses.

The diagnostic evaluation includes a history, physical examination, limited laboratory testing, imaging, and cystourethroscopy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>History and physical examination</strong> &ndash; Women with symptoms of bladder endometriosis are evaluated for symptoms and signs of both endometriosis and urinary tract disease. As women with bladder endometriosis often have endometriosis at multiple anatomic sites, the initial history and physical examination is the same for women suspected of having bladder endometriosis as for women with generalized symptoms of endometriosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-of-the-bladder-and-ureter/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Urine culture is done if infection is suspected. Women with hematuria proceed with cystourethroscopy.

A consensus opinion from the International Deep Endometriosis Analysis (IDEA) group suggests specific assessment of the trigone, bladder base, and dome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-of-the-bladder-and-ureter/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Although ultrasound cannot definitively diagnose endometriosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-of-the-bladder-and-ureter/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], findings suggestive of bladder endometriosis include nodules, abnormal adherence of adjacent structures in the vesicouterine pouch, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hydronephrosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F105235\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef105235 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-of-the-bladder-and-ureter/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

In addition, the examiner can use the ultrasound probe to assess organ immobility and elicited pain, both of which suggest other foci of deeply infiltrating endometriosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-of-the-bladder-and-ureter/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].

Women who are diagnosed with bladder lesions and hydronephrosis undergo additional radiologic assessment of the ureter. In our practice, we request a computed tomography (CT) urogram. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-obstruction-and-hydronephrosis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of urinary tract obstruction and hydronephrosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cystourethroscopy</strong> &ndash; For women with a bladder nodule seen on imaging or hematuria, we perform cystourethroscopy to biopsy the lesion, rule out malignancy, and measure the distance from the lesion to the ureteral meatus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-of-the-bladder-and-ureter/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

The lesions can be large and multiple, but are often single, averaging approximately 1 cm in diameter in size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-of-the-bladder-and-ureter/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Endometriotic bladder nodules up to 5 cm in size have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-of-the-bladder-and-ureter/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, we assess the distance of the lesion(s) to the ureteral openings to determine whether removal of the lesion(s) will require ureteral resection and reimplantation with ureteroneocystostomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-of-the-bladder-and-ureter/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Women who have undergone prior trigone resection are at increased risk of having nodules in close proximity with the trigone or ureteral orifices. If the caudal border of the endometriotic lesion is less than 2 cm from the inter-ureteric ridge, ureteroneocystostomy is typically performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-of-the-bladder-and-ureter/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H66948575\" class=\"local\">'Ureteroneocystostomy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Lesions that are identified on pelvic ultrasound but not visible at time of cystourethroscopy are presumably intramural and are evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-of-the-bladder-and-ureter/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>].

Hematuria, gross or microscopic, can be present. Urinary tract stones are typically identified on non-contrast computed tomography or ultrasound studies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and acute management of suspected nephrolithiasis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bladder neoplasm</strong> &ndash; Bladder neoplasms can be benign or malignant.

We begin with medical therapy, since this approach avoids the risk of surgical complications and treats pain symptoms associated with pelvic endometriosis. The disadvantages of medical therapy are that it must be continued until menopause (when endometriosis typically regresses) and that it is not effective in all women. We reserve surgery for women who have failed medical therapy, cannot receive medical therapy, or who wish to avoid chronic medical treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Treatment of pelvic pain&quot;, section on 'Medical treatment options'</a>.)</p><p>The data comparing medical and surgical therapy are limited. One cohort study of women with deep dyspareunia from deeply infiltrating endometriosis (urinary and rectovaginal) reported that 60 percent of women treated medically were satisfied but nearly one-third of women had an inadequate response to medical therapy and required surgical management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-of-the-bladder-and-ureter/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>One exception to the above approach is the patient with both bladder endometriosis and hydronephrosis. We perform surgery as the primary treatment to prevent subsequent renal damage, similar to women with ureteral endometriosis.

We begin with a cyclic regimen of combined estrogen-progestin oral contraceptives (ie, three weeks of therapy followed by a placebo week). If perimenstrual symptoms do not resolve within 3 to 6 months of starting a cyclic regimen, we then switch to a continuous schedule for menstrual suppression. For women who prefer continuous menstrual suppression, we begin treatment with a continuous regimen rather than the cyclic regimen.</p><p>Women who are not candidates for or do not want estrogen-containing medications are treated with progestin-only methods such as pills, injection, implant, or intrauterine device. Patients select the method that best meets their dosing, contraceptive, and cost needs.

These medications can be used with or without estrogen-progestin add-back therapy.

While trial data do not support routine use of ureteral catheters for gynecologic surgery, we find them helpful in women who have lesions close to the ureteric orifice, a history of prior bladder surgery, or significant anatomic distortion.

If the nodule is located on the bladder dome, preliminary dissection to fully access the lesion is not typically required. In contrast, if the lesion involves the posterior bladder or the vesical base, we dissect the vesicouterine space to mobilize the bladder from the uterus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79226\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79226 \">picture 2</a>).

Women with less extensive disease undergo more conservative surgery consisting of ureterolysis and resection of all other endometriosis implants. Although ureterolysis appears to have a higher restenosis rate compared with ureteroneocystostomy (8 versus 3 percent), the data are limited and do not justify performing a more morbid surgery when a less invasive procedure will restore renal function for more than 90 percent of women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-of-the-bladder-and-ureter/abstract/14,17,48,73-79\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,17,48,73-79</a>].

The peritoneum overlying the ureter is opened at the level of the pelvic brim, where both the ureter and peritoneum are rarely affected by endometriotic disease or associated fibrosis. The ureter is then exposed down to the level of the cardinal ligament. In women with healthy retroperitoneal tissue, this is done by blunt dissection. If endometriosis is present, we use cold or electrosurgical scissors to excise adjacent endometrial lesions. Removal of lesions can be difficult to achieve since endometriotic nodules can infiltrate the ureteral wall and often have no clear cleavage planes in relation to surrounding structures. Despite the challenge, we remove all lesions, rather than ablate them, because ablation increases the risk of ureteral fistula.</p><p>If endometriosis invades the ureteral adventitia (outer layer), more aggressive ureterolysis is necessary.

Surgeries that disrupt the endometrium, such as cesarean delivery or transmural myomectomy, may spread endometrial tissue or include endometrial tissue in the closure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-of-the-bladder-and-ureter/abstract/3,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,88</a>]. In contrast to women with spontaneous endometriosis, women with iatrogenic endometriosis typically have isolated foci of endometriosis, often in the surgical scar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-of-the-bladder-and-ureter/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Women with bladder endometriosis are managed as reviewed above, regardless of the cause.

Although the relative position of the uterus to the bladder shifts during pregnancy, the gravid uterus does not facilitate development of tissue planes and resection of endometriotic lesions because these lesions are typically adherent to the surrounding tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-of-the-bladder-and-ureter/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H254712964\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

In addition, anatomic structures (eg, anteverted uterine fundus, sigmoid colon) of the pelvis may provide sheltered pockets that protect ectopic endometrial cells from the usual peritoneal clearance mechanisms and allow endometrial implants to develop. (See <a href=\"#H17036461\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Of women diagnosed with pelvic endometriosis, approximately 1 percent have urinary tract endometriosis, most commonly bladder endometriosis. Endometriosis of the ureter occurs in approximately 0.1 percent of women. However, in the subpopulation of women with deeply infiltrating endometriosis, urinary tract endometriosis has been diagnosed in up to 20 to 50 percent. These wide ranges may reflect referral patterns rather than true disease prevalence. (See <a href=\"#H29778329\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bladder endometriosis is an endometriotic lesion that infiltrates the detrusor muscle and can be either partial or full thickness. Women with bladder endometriosis typically present with dysuria or with lower urinary tract symptoms such as urinary urgency and frequency.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The diagnostic evaluation of women with suspected bladder endometriosis includes a history, physical examination, limited laboratory testing to exclude infection, imaging to evaluate for bladder lesions and hydronephrosis, and cystourethroscopy to assess for lesions and location relative to the ureteral orifices. (See <a href=\"#H1147551123\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Bladder endometriosis is diagnosed by biopsy of lesions <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> visualization of lesions. Biopsy is typically necessary to exclude malignancy. (See <a href=\"#H947280773\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1679461292\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1147551123\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Treatment of bladder endometriosis is aimed at resolving symptoms; asymptomatic women can be observed. For most women with symptomatic bladder endometriosis, we suggest medical rather than surgical treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We reserve surgery for women who have failed or have contraindications to medical therapy, who wish to avoid chronic medical treatment, or who have hydronephrosis. (See <a href=\"#H17036840\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ureteral endometriosis may be either within the ureteral wall (intrinsic) or involve the overlying peritoneum (extrinsic). More than one-half of women with ureteral endometriosis are asymptomatic; others present with colicky flank pain or gross hematuria. Both forms can cause ureteral stenosis and obstruction. Hydronephrosis in asymptomatic patients may result in silent loss of renal function. (See <a href=\"#H721957810\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17037257\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The diagnostic evaluation of women with suspected ureteral endometriosis includes a history, physical examination, laboratory testing to assess renal function and exclude urinary tract infection, and pelvic and renal ultrasounds to evaluate for ureteral lesions, hydroureter, and hydronephrosis. Cystourethroscopy is performed to exclude bladder lesions. Ureteral endometriosis is diagnosed by visualization <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> biopsy of lesions. (See <a href=\"#H3071910012\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Treatment of ureteral endometriosis is surgical, since medical therapy has not been proven effective at relieving ureteral obstruction. For women with hydronephrosis in whom surgery must be delayed, we suggest a combination of medical therapy and insertion of a ureteral stent rather than either treatment alone or no treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1246688325\" class=\"local\">'Choice of procedure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The first step in surgical treatment of ureteral endometriosis is ureterolysis. Subsequent surgical management can include resection of a segment (ureterectomy) with anastomosis (ureteroureteral anastomosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F110222\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110222 \">figure 1</a>)) or with ureteral implantation into the bladder (ureteroneocystostomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F110221\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110221 \">figure 2</a>)). Lesions of the lower third of the ureter typically require ureteroneocystostomy. (See <a href=\"#H66948285\" class=\"local\">'Ureterolysis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H66948535\" class=\"local\">'Ureterectomy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H66948575\" class=\"local\">'Ureteroneocystostomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The cumulative surgical complication rate after treatment of ureteral endometriosis has been reported as 9 percent. The most complications include persistence or recurrence of ureteral stenosis requiring repeat surgery (7.4 percent), ureteral or uretero-vaginal fistula (1.6 percent), and hemoperitoneum (0.4 percent). (See <a href=\"#H66948621\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The rate of restenosis appears to vary by ureteral procedure, but definitive conclusions are limited by the small sample size and lack of comparative trials.
