Some of the genes responsible for these conditions have been identified. Muscle weakness is the primary symptom.</p><p>The pathogenesis, genetics, and clinical characteristics of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy will be reviewed here.

It includes a number of heterogeneous genetic disorders that vary in severity, phenotype, pathology, and age of onset, which ranges from childhood through adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. LGMD is still used as a generic term to describe those patients with muscular dystrophy of girdle distribution.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most cases of LGMD are inherited in an autosomal recessive or an autosomal dominant pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In some families, the inheritance pattern cannot be determined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The discovery of genetically distinct subtypes has redefined the classification of LGMD and has led to nomenclature designating the autosomal dominant forms as LGMD1A, 1B, 1C, etc, and the autosomal recessive forms as LGMD2A, 2B, 2C, etc (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F78969\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78969 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Autosomal dominant subtypes'</a> below and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Autosomal recessive subtypes'</a> below.)</p><p>Mutations within the same gene can result in different phenotypes that are sometimes not consistent with the strict definition of LGMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Calpainopathy is caused by mutations in the calpain-3 gene (CAPN3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Calpain-3 interacts with cytoskeletal proteins such as titin and dysferlin, and plays a role in sarcomere remodeling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. While the precise mechanism of calpainopathy is uncertain, loss of functional calpain-3 leads to abnormal muscle sarcomeres and eventual muscle fiber death. The phenotype of calpainopathy is variable, and ranges from pelvic and shoulder girdle muscle weakness as in LGMD2A described below (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Autosomal recessive subtypes'</a> below) to asymptomatic disease with elevated serum creatine kinase levels (hyperCKemia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dysferlinopathies encompass dysferlin gene (DYSF) mutations that cause two main types of muscular dystrophy (LGMD2B and Miyoshi distal myopathy) and other muscle disorders with variable phenotypes ranging from asymptomatic hyperCKemia to severe disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Mounting evidence suggests that these dysferlin myopathies (dysferlinopathies) are clinically more homogeneous than once thought. One retrospective report followed 29 patients with DYSF gene mutations (including 12 with LGMD2B and 14 with Miyoshi myopathy as diagnosed by initial symptoms) for a mean of 6.4 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. There were no differences between patients with LGMD2B and Miyoshi myopathy in the rate of disease progression or functional status. In addition, the pattern of muscle involvement on MRI was the same; the adductor magnus and gastrocnemius medialis were the first affected muscles in both groups.<br/><br/>In experimental mice, deficiency of dysferlin disrupts the ability to reseal injured sarcolemma, resulting in muscle degeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Loss of dysferlin induces complement-mediated inflammation, which contributes to muscle injury in dysferlinopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/11,15-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,15-20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sarcoglycanopathies (ie, LGMD2C, 2D, 2E, and 2F), are early-onset autosomal recessive LGMDs caused by mutations in alpha, beta, gamma, and delta sarcoglycans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. These are members of the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66588\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66588 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dystroglycanopathies include a variety of autosomal recessive muscular dystrophies caused by mutations in several genes, including FKRP, GMPPB, ISPD, LARGE, POMGnT1, POMT1, and POMT2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/4,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,22</a>]. The underlying pathogenic mechanism for these mutations is reduced glycosylation of the extracellular alpha-dystroglycan protein (ie, secondary dystroglycanopathies). Mutations in all these genes but LARGE are associated with autosomal recessive LGMD variants with childhood or adult onset.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, a mutation in the core dystroglycan protein itself (ie, a primary dystroglycanopathy), caused by a missense mutation in the DAG1 gene, has been identified as a cause of LGMD associated with cognitive impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Several of the gene mutations that cause secondary dystroglycanopathy are also associated with congenital muscular dystrophies, including Walker-Warburg syndrome, Fukuyama type of congenital muscular dystrophy, and muscle-eye-brain disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oculopharyngeal-distal-and-congenital-muscular-dystrophies#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oculopharyngeal, distal, and congenital muscular dystrophies&quot;, section on 'Congenital muscular dystrophies'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laminopathies are caused by mutations in the LMNA gene encoding lamin <span class=\"nowrap\">A/C</span> and encompass a number of conditions with diverse phenotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>], including autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emery-dreifuss-muscular-dystrophy#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy&quot;, section on 'Laminopathies'</a>) and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1B (LGMD1B) with cardiac conduction system disease (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Autosomal dominant subtypes'</a> below).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Caveolinopathies are caused by mutations in the caveolin 3 gene (CAV3). The phenotype of caveolinopathies is broad and includes asymptomatic creatine kinase elevation, myalgias and cramps, rippling muscle disease and distal myopathy, which appear to be more common than the classic LGMD presentation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H367879\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Together, the group of disorders that constitute LGMD is the fourth most common genetic cause of muscle weakness &ndash; behind the dystrophinopathies (Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy), myotonic dystrophy, and facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy &ndash; with an estimated minimum prevalence of 1 in 20,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The age of onset of LGMD varies from early childhood to adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/5,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The general features of the disorders that make up LGMD are progressive weakness and muscle atrophy mainly involving the shoulder girdle (scapulohumeral type), the pelvic girdle (pelvifemoral type), or both. Most childhood-onset cases have a pelvifemoral distribution of weakness. By comparison, adult-onset disease usually involves both shoulder and pelvic girdles with gradually increasing proximal limb weakness, thereby leading to restriction of mobility and eventually to wheelchair confinement.</p><p>Facial weakness is usually mild and, in some cases, totally absent. Extraocular muscles are completely spared in the LGMDs. Distal muscle strength is usually preserved, even at the late stage of the disease, but distal muscle weakness can be an early or prominent feature in some LGMD subtypes</p><p>Intellect is usually normal, though intellectual disability is a feature of LGMD2K and has been reported in LGMD2N [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Many of the subtypes of LGMD have characteristic though nonspecific clinical manifestations. They are discussed below according to pattern of inheritance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F78969\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78969 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The most prevalent LGMD subtypes are the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LGMD2A (calpainopathy)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LGMD2B (dysferlinopathy)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LGMD2C through 2F (the sarcoglycanopathies)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LGMD2I (dystroglycanopathy)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LGMD2L (anoctamin 5)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LGMD1B (laminopathy)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Autosomal dominant subtypes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presentation of autosomal dominant LGMD (designated LGMD1) shows greater clinical heterogeneity, later age of onset, more gradual progression, and a creatine kinase elevation that may be minimal compared with autosomal recessive subtypes.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nasal quality of speech, dysarthria, and slow disease progression is typical in LGMD1A (myotilinopathy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LGMD1B (laminopathy) is the most common autosomal dominant type, and accounts for 5 to 10 percent of all cases of LGMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Though autosomal dominant, there may be variable penetrance from generation to generation. The typical age of onset ranges from 2 to 25 years of age, but earlier or later onset can occur. The pattern of weakness is limb-girdle or humeroperoneal. Cardiac conduction defects, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, and mild elbow and neck contractures are common manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/2,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,28</a>], thus overlapping with autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emery-dreifuss-muscular-dystrophy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy&quot;</a>). Creatine kinase levels range from 200 to 2000 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Cardiac involvement is generally seen by the second or third decade in LGMD1B. Most affected individuals require pacemakers; worsening heart failure due to arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy may necessitate heart transplantation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LGMD1C is an autosomal dominant condition caused by mutations in the caveolin 3 (CAV3) gene on chromosome 3p25 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Caveolin acts as a scaffolding protein in the formation of caveolae, which are small invaginations of the cell membrane involved in T-tubule formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Caveolin 3 localizes to the sarcolemma of skeletal and cardiac muscle and plays a role in signal transduction, sodium channel function, vesicular trafficking, and maintenance of plasma membrane integrity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with CAV3 mutations may develop symptoms in childhood or adult life. The phenotype is variable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Asymptomatic creatine kinase elevation, myalgias and cramps <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> stiffness after exertion, rippling muscle disease, and distal myopathy involving the tibialis anterior or gastrocnemius muscles may be more common than the classic LGMD presentation (ie, proximal weakness, often with calf hypertrophy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/6,30,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,30,34,35</a>]. Familial isolated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Although inheritance is autosomal dominant, the lack of a family history does not exclude the diagnosis of LGMD1C. Mutations of CAV3 exhibit intrafamilial variability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Laboratory testing shows a 3- to 25-fold elevation of creatine kinase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], and muscle biopsy demonstrates nonspecific myopathic findings with normal sarcoglycan, merosin, and dystrophin staining [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. However, staining for caveolin 3 may be reduced or absent in the sarcolemma, and electron microscopy shows diminished density or loss of caveolae in the muscle membranes. DNA testing for caveolin mutations is commercially available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rippling muscle disease (RMD) is an allelic autosomal dominant genetic disorder with a phenotype that overlaps that of LGMD1C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-41</a>]. While some patients with RMD have mutations in the CAV3 gene, sporadic cases associated with myasthenia gravis have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. RMD disease typically starts in childhood or adolescence with myalgias, cramps, and stiffness induced by exercise, but rarely presents in adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The most frequently affected muscles are the quadriceps and biceps brachii. Associated muscle hypertrophy, particularly of the calves, is common. Direct percussion of muscle produces continuous rolling, rippling waves of muscle contractions that spread across the muscle, sometimes with a distinctive rapid muscle contraction, and in some patients with a painful mounding up of the muscle. Percussion of muscle may also produce a contraction very similar to percussion myotonia. Muscle rippling is accompanied by needle electromyographic silence. In the absence of family history of RMD, an evaluation for myasthenia gravis may be necessary, particularly if genetic testing for CAV3 mutations is negative. In patients with severe stiffness and painful cramps, treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dantrolene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dantrolene</a> sodium or benzodiazepines may be helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/39,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,44</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LGMD1D, designated as LGMD1E by the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim&amp;token=ODIqmPyH03K5IrNHL4ootvp3ssM86wOnxIOFqyKtC9PVT+Q7Wyoj4BSo1aAOfH84&amp;TOPIC_ID=6190\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man</a> (OMIM) database, is characterized by adult-onset, slowly progressive muscle weakness with mild dystrophic changes, vacuoles and abnormal protein aggregation on muscle biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/45-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-48</a>].

When the involvement is only distal, it is known as Miyoshi distal myopathy. In LGMD2B, arm weakness may occur with progression, but scapular winging is not seen. Likewise, there is no facial weakness or dysphagia. Cardiac or pulmonary involvement is uncommon; when it does occur, it is usually asymptomatic and late in the course of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/1,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,66</a>].

Although these data are not definitive, they suggest that low-impact aerobic exercise and supervised submaximal strength training routines are probably safe for patients with LGMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Confirmation of these findings in larger trials is needed before exercise can be routinely recommended for patients with LGMD.</p><p>Based upon theoretical concerns that patient with muscular degeneration due to muscular dystrophy are at increased risk for exercise-induced muscle injury, national guidelines advise that patients with muscular dystrophy should maintain adequate hydration, avoid supramaximal, high-intensity exercise, and avoid exercising to exhaustion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, they should be informed about warning signs of excessive exercise and myoglobinuria, which include feeling weaker rather than stronger within 30 minutes after exercise, excessive muscle soreness 24 to 48 hours after exercise, severe muscle cramping, feeling heaviness in the limbs, and prolonged shortness of breath. These symptoms suggest that the exercise program is too aggressive and should be reduced.</p><p>There are only limited data supporting the use of other rehabilitative therapies for LGMD, such as bracing, assistive devices, and computer-based interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H367887\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many subtypes of LGMD have associated cardiac involvement, including LGMD1A, LGMD1B, LGMD1D, LGMD1E, LGMD2C to 2K, and LGMD2M to 2P. In many cases, patients with these subtypes lack overt symptoms of cardiac disease that may herald cardiac morbidity or sudden death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Therefore, all patients with these LGMD subtypes and those with an LGMD phenotype who do not have a specific genetic diagnosis should have a baseline cardiology evaluation that includes examination, ECG, and structural heart studies with echocardiography or cardiac MRI to guide management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. Patients with abnormal findings on these studies or those with symptoms suggesting arrhythmias (eg, dizziness, palpitations, or syncope) should have prolonged cardiac event monitoring. Patients with LGMD2C, 2D, 2E, and 2F (the sarcoglycanopathies) and LGMD2I who are asymptomatic with normal cardiac findings should have follow-up cardiac evaluations every two years to include examination, ECG, and echocardiography; patients with abnormal cardiac findings should have such follow-up annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. Patients with LGMD1B should have similar follow-up, with the addition of ambulatory cardiac event monitoring every two years if asymptomatic and annually if there are abnormal cardiac findings. All patients with LGMD and cardiac symptoms should be referred to a cardiologist.</p><p>Heart transplantation has been successful in some patients with LGMD1B and other LGMDs who developed severe congestive failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/101,102\" class=\"abstract_t\">101,102</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H367927\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A few LGMDs (eg, LGMD2I) are associated with weakness of respiratory or oropharyngeal muscles and an increased risk of respiratory failure with disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Similar to cardiac involvement, patients with respiratory compromise due to LGMD often lack symptoms that herald the onset of respiratory failure. Therefore, patients at risk for pulmonary complications should have pulmonary function testing or referral for pulmonary evaluation at the time of diagnosis. Periodic pulmonary function testing or pulmonary follow-up is indicated if testing identifies pulmonary disease or if the LGMD subtype is associated with a high risk of respiratory failure.</p><p>Patients with LGMD who have evidence of respiratory insufficiency, daytime somnolence, or symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing may benefit from noninvasive ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H367964\"><span class=\"h2\">Swallowing and feeding complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dysphagia and arm weakness associated with LGMDs can lead to difficulties maintaining adequate nutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

In other cases, particularly those inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, the weakness may not be apparent until early or even late in adult life. The course is usually one of slowly progressive, mostly symmetric weakness, with the exception of a few types with rapid progression or asymmetric weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

It is used as a generic term to describe those patients with muscular dystrophy of girdle distribution, having a predominantly proximal distribution of weakness that, early in the course of the disease, spares distal muscles as well as facial and extraocular muscles. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LGMDs are inherited in an autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant pattern. In some families, the inheritance pattern cannot be determined. The nomenclature designates the autosomal dominant forms as LGMD1A, 1B, 1C, etc, and the autosomal recessive forms as LGMD2A, 2B, 2C, etc (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F78969\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78969 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Together, the group of disorders that constitute LGMD are the fourth most common genetic cause of muscle weakness, with an estimated minimum prevalence of 1 in 20,000. The age of onset of LGMD varies from early childhood to adulthood.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weakness in LGMD may affect the shoulder girdle (scapulohumeral type), the pelvic girdle (pelvifemoral type), or both. Facial weakness is usually mild and, in some cases, totally absent. Extraocular muscles are completely spared in the LGMDs. Distal muscle strength is usually preserved, even at the late stage of the disease; however, distal muscle weakness and atrophy may occur in certain forms of LGMD. Intellect is usually normal. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many of the subtypes of LGMD have distinguishing though nonspecific clinical characteristics (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F78969\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78969 \">table 1</a>). They are discussed above according to pattern of inheritance. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Autosomal dominant subtypes'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Autosomal recessive subtypes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients suspected of having LGMD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F97687\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef97687 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F97685\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef97685 \">algorithm 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F97686\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef97686 \">algorithm 3</a>), we suggest genetic testing prior to obtaining a muscle biopsy. Single-gene testing, rather than the entire LGMD profile, is preferred whenever the clinical findings point to a particular subtype of LGMD. A muscle biopsy is appropriate if genetic and protein testing for LGMD is uninformative or unavailable. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of conditions characterized by proximal-predominant muscle weakness are more prevalent than LGMD, and should be excluded early in the evaluation. The list includes the dystrophinopathies (Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy), acquired muscle disorders such as toxic, endocrine, and autoimmune myopathies, and nonmuscle disorders such as myasthenia gravis and spinal muscular atrophy. Pompe disease should also be excluded because it is treatable. (See <a href=\"#H86863489\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of LGMD is supportive; no disease-modifying treatments are available. Goals of therapy include maintaining mobility and functional independence, managing associated complications, and maximizing quality of life. Multidisciplinary treatment involving physical and occupational therapy, respiratory therapy, speech and swallowing therapy, cardiology, pulmonology, orthopedics, and genetics is recommended to provide optimal care.
