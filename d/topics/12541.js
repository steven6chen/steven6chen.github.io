However, the rate of decline varies with age, underlying etiology, and clinical findings. An improvement in renal function is often seen in the first two years of life, and this may be followed by a period of stability until puberty, when declining function develops [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt-for-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Children with glomerular disease, proteinuria, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypertension are more likely to have a progressive fall in renal function regardless of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt-for-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Nevertheless, as the estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) declines to less than 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (CKD stage 4), preparations for renal replacement therapy (RRT) are needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt-for-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The family and, if appropriate, the child should be provided with information related to preemptive kidney transplantation, peritoneal dialysis (PD), and hemodialysis (HD).</p><p>The choice and timing of RRT for children with CKD are reviewed here.

GFR increases with maturation from infancy and approaches adult mean values by two years of age. Children under two years of age, therefore, do not fit within the above classification system because they normally have a low GFR even when corrected for body surface area. For this reason, an improvement in GFR can be seen at this age range in CKD as well. In these patients, calculated GFR based upon serum creatinine can be compared with normative age-appropriate values to detect kidney impairment.

The highest estimated incidence of ESRD in children was reported in New Zealand with an annual rate of 18 per million children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt-for-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In the United States, the incidence of ESRD peaked in 1996 and decreased to 15 per million children in 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt-for-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A low annual incidence of ESRD has been reported in Japan with a rate of 4 per million children at or below 19 years of age. The incidence even varies within Europe, being 3.6 per 1 million age-related population in eastern Europe, 7.2 in southern Europe, 7.8 in western Europe and 8.1 in northern Europe. The differences, which particularly affected younger children, were related to economic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt-for-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The incidence of pediatric ESRD increases with age: For example, in the United Kingdom approximately 3 percent of the total RRT population are less than two years of age, 28 percent are aged two to eight years, 28 percent are 8 to 12 years, and 40 percent are 12 to 16 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt-for-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The variability in the incidence of ESRD is thought to be affected by genetic and environmental factors, the ability to diagnosis and manage children with significant renal impairment, and the threshold for when RRT is initiated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt-for-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In particular, the developed countries are more likely to possess the necessary resources for the detection and treatment of ESRD.</p><p>In the United States, the incidence of starting RRT for pediatric ESRD is approximately 14.2 patients per million children, which represented 1398 new patients &lt;21 years old in 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt-for-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

In addition, because pediatric nephrologists generally follow their patients from the early stages of CKD, they can more easily prepare the patient and their family for transplantation and avoid initiating dialysis. If a living related donor is not available, many countries prioritize children on the deceased donor transplant waiting list.</p><p>Despite these advantages, preemptive transplantation is still not achieved in the majority of children with ESRD because they may present in CKD stage 5 with insufficient preparatory time required for transplantation prior to the need for dialysis or because transplantation is not possible or advisable due to small size, comorbidity, non-adherence to medical therapy, family instability, or other factors.</p><p>Preemptive transplantation has increasingly become the initial choice of treatment for pediatric ESRD.

At that level of kidney function, the classical clinical indications for dialysis include fluid overload, uremic symptoms, and uncontrolled metabolic abnormalities (eg, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia). In Europe, the average GFR at the time of commencement of RRT was 9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt-for-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>RRT may be initiated earlier in children with CKD primarily to permit the provision of the nutritional needs necessary to maintain normal (or near normal) growth. As noted above, preemptive renal transplantation is the preferred modality, as it is the intervention that provides the best outcomes regarding growth, development, quality of life, and patient survival. On the other hand, some children with continuing good urine volumes can be maintained off dialysis for a substantial period of time with very low GFRs if strict attention is paid to growth, nutrition, and therapeutic control of metabolic abnormalities. There is no evidence that either approach is better. (See <a href=\"#H445803611\" class=\"local\">'Preemptive renal transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p>For patients who undergo dialysis as the initial RRT, earlier indications for intervention prior to CKD stage 5 may include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with nephrotic syndrome requiring bilateral nephrectomies pretransplant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Correction of metabolic abnormalities that fail medical management including hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and metabolic acidosis.

This is especially an issue with infants who are maintained on a completely liquid diet (ie, formula or breast milk).

Vascular access options include arteriovenous (AV) fistula or a central venous tunneled catheter. AV fistulae require time to mature prior to use, which may be several weeks to months. As a result, if an AV fistula is chosen, it needs to be several weeks to months prior to the initiation of dialysis. As in adults, the &quot;fistula first&quot; policy applies to children as well, as AV fistulae are associated with a lower incidence of complications compared with catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt-for-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. The use of a central venous catheter, which is associated with a greater rate of infectious complications when compared with AV fistulae, should ideally be reserved for patients too small to permit surgical construction of a fistula or when there is an expectation for expeditious (&lt;1 year) kidney transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt-for-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The need for increased attention for advanced proactive planning for placement and maturation of an AV fistula (optimal vascular access) is reflected by the finding that most pediatric patients (81 percent) in the United States initiate HD with a central venous catheter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt-for-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Use of a double cuff catheter and perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis within 60 minutes prior to the incision for catheter placement has been associated with fewer infectious complications of PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt-for-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Ideally, there should be ample time for the abdominal wound to heal prior to the initiation of dialysis, thereby avoiding complications of leaking and infection. The minimum timeframe for healing is approximately two weeks.

This variability is thought to be due to genetic and environmental factors, as well as the ability to detect ESRD and provide RRT to children with significant renal impairment. (See <a href=\"#H363124244\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology of ESRD and RRT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common cause of pediatric ESRD is congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT). The proportion of cases with CAKUT decreases with increasing age due to the increasing incidence of acquired glomerular disease.

(See <a href=\"#H363124528\" class=\"local\">'Choice of RRT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Preemptive transplantation is the preferred RRT, because it is associated with better long-term outcomes (eg, growth, development, quality of life, and mortality) and less disruption to patients and their families. (See <a href=\"#H445803611\" class=\"local\">'Preemptive renal transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>When preemptive transplantation is not an option, the choice between the two forms of dialysis for ESRD is generally dictated by technical, social, and compliance issues, and family preference. (See <a href=\"#H445803487\" class=\"local\">'Choice of dialysis modality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As in adults, some form of RRT may be needed in children when the GFR falls below 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (CKD stage 5). RRT may be occasionally initiated earlier in children, primarily to maintain normal growth and to manage metabolic abnormalities that are unresponsive to other medical interventions. However, some children, and in particular, infants, with maintained urine output may continue without dialysis for years if attention is paid to their nutritional and therapeutic management.
