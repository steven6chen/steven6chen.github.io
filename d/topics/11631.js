Neonates and especially premature infants are at risk for calcium salt crystallization because of renal tubule immaturity, and increased likelihood of hypercalciuria (increased promoting factor) and hypocitraturia (loss of inhibiting factor) as discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111582676\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111584190\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal tubular immaturity in preterm infants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preterm infants are at increased risk for nephrocalcinosis due to renal tubular immaturity, which increases with decreasing birth weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrocalcinosis-in-neonates/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Nephrogenesis is not completed until 34 to 36 weeks gestation. As a result in the developing kidney, there is continuing proliferation of renal epithelium cells within the renal tubule that are thought to be more susceptible to crystal formation and aggregation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrocalcinosis-in-neonates/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

This enhances crystal formation and aggregation particularly in the setting of tubular fluid supersaturation, which is promoted by hypercalciuria and hypocitraturia (commonly observed findings in preterm infants).</p><p>Very low birth weight preterm infants (birth weight &lt;1500 g) also have decreased bicarbonate reabsorptive capacity.

Nephrocalcinosis occurs more frequently in neonates, especially preterm infants because of their renal tubular immaturity and administration of medications and nutritional supplements that promote calcium salt deposition.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The reported incidence of nephrocalcinosis in preterm infants ranges from 7 to 41 percent. (See <a href=\"#H111578371\" class=\"local\">'Incidence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors for neonatal nephrocalcinosis include prematurity, administration of loop diuretics, increased dietary calcium, and vitamin D supplementation. Genetic disorders associated with neonatal nephrocalcinosis include those with hypercalcemia (Williams-Beuren syndrome and idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia) and those with hypercalcuria in the setting of normal blood levels of calcium (distal renal tubular acidosis [RTA] and Bartter syndrome).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neonates with nephrocalcinosis are asymptomatic. Nephrocalcinosis presents as either an incidental finding when renal imaging is performed for another reason or when renal ultrasound screening is performed for at-risk infants. (See <a href=\"#H451774301\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis is typically made by renal ultrasound (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F106015\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef106015 \">image 1</a>), although nephrocalcinosis can be detected by whole body or abdominal radiography or computed tomography. (See <a href=\"#H760376\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An initial diagnostic evaluation is performed for all neonates with nephrocalcinosis to determine the underlying cause (if possible). It includes a focused medical history, and laboratory evaluation that includes urine and blood tests to detect hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, impaired urinary concentrating ability or distal renal acidification, and alterations in <span class=\"nowrap\">acid/base</span> status (eg, metabolic acidosis and alkalosis). (See <a href=\"#H760543\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial management of neonatal nephrocalcinosis is directed towards treating the underlying cause. (See <a href=\"#H451774307\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For infants with nephrocalcinosis due to medications (eg, loop diuretics) or nutritional supplementation (eg, calcium or vitamin D), elimination of the causative agent is usually sufficient to stop further progression of calcium salt deposition and begin nephrocalcinosis resolution. For furosemide-associated nephrocalcinosis in preterm infants, we recommend that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">furosemide</a> be discontinued and replaced by a thiazide diuretic (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For infants with genetic disorders, therapy is directed towards addressing the metabolic abnormalities that contribute to the development of nephrocalcinosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although nephrocalcinosis resolves in the majority of cases, it remains unclear whether nephrocalcinosis results in significant chronic kidney injury. As a result, continued follow-up of affected patients is required to ascertain the long-term renal effect of neonatal nephrocalcinosis.
