If refrigerated serum and plasma both form a precipitate, then the precipitated proteins are referred to as cryoglobulins (CGs). If, however, precipitation develops after refrigeration of plasma but does not occur in cold serum, the plasma precipitate is referred to as cryofibrinogen (CF).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Cryoprecipitates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both CGs and CF typically redissolve with warming to 37&ordm;C, but the components of CF and CG differ. CGs typically contain immunoglobulins and complement components. Although CF may also contain immunoglobulins, CF is characteristically composed of fibrinogen, fibrin, fibronectin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fibrin degradation products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryofibrinogenemia/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].

Three different types of CGs are recognized and the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and treatment associated with each type are discussed elsewhere. The following is a brief summary of the types of cryoglobulinemia (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cryoglobulins and cryoglobulinemia&quot;, section on 'Classification'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type I cryoglobulinemia, in which there is a monoclonal immunoglobulin that is most often due to an underlying B cell proliferative disorder such as multiple myeloma or Waldenstr&ouml;m&rsquo;s macroglobulinemia.

Some people with cryofibrinogenemia are asymptomatic, while others have clinical features resulting from thrombosis. Cryofibrinogenemia may also be associated with other disease processes, such as malignancy, infection, and connective tissue and autoimmune disorders.</p><p>The remainder of this topic review addresses issues related to the measurement of CF and the significance of cryofibrinogenemia in healthy people and patients in whom such cryoprecipitates play a clinically important pathologic role.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">MEASUREMENT OF CRYOFIBRINOGEN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The accuracy of cryofibrinogen (CF) assays is critically dependent upon the method of collection. Collected blood should be anticoagulated with ethylenediaminetetraacetate&nbsp;(EDTA), citrate or oxalate, and maintained at 37&ordm;C until the plasma is collected. Ideally, this includes separation in a temperature controlled centrifuge. The plasma is placed in a Wintrobe tube and refrigerated at 4&ordm;C for 72 hours, at which time the &quot;cryocrit&quot; is quantitated by centrifuging the specimen while it remains cooled to 4&ordm;C.</p><p>A positive result is typically reported as percentage of cryocrit (as measured in a graduated Wintrobe tube). Quantitation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> identification of the individual CF components may be facilitated by use of a number of techniques, such as chromatography, immunodiffusion, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> electrophoresis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryofibrinogenemia/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>The formation of a cryoprecipitate before the plasma is assayed can lead to a falsely negative result if collection is not performed at 37&ordm;C. A false positive result may occur if heparin is present as an anticoagulant in the blood collection tube or from therapeutic use, because it can complex with fibrinogen, fibrin, and fibronectin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryofibrinogenemia/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several disease processes have been associated with cryofibrinogenemia, which may be classified as primary (or essential or idiopathic) versus secondary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F72157\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72157 \">table 1</a>). The most frequently associated disorders include malignancy (8 to 39 percent), infections (11 to 32 percent), and inflammatory processes such as systemic rheumatic diseases (14 to 82 percent) or thromboembolic conditions (0 to 7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryofibrinogenemia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. These disorders may or may not be evident at the time of diagnosis of cryofibrinogenemia, but become clinically apparent later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryofibrinogenemia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Rare familial forms have been described, but their molecular bases remain unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryofibrinogenemia/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].</p><p>The underlying pathogenesis of sporadic cryofibrinogenemia is uncertain. Pathology in cryofibrinogenemia is attributed to &quot;in situ&quot; thrombosis mediated by circulating CF. The major components of CF include fibrinogen, fibrin, and fibronectin (also called cold-insoluble globulin, or CIg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryofibrinogenemia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Fibronectin has been characterized functionally by the ability to bind to fibrin and fibrinogen, and &quot;in vitro&quot; studies have suggested that fibronectin acts as a nucleus for the cold-induced cryoprecipitation of fibrinogen-fibrin complexes. Other components of CF include alpha(1)-antitrypsin, and alpha(2)-macroglobulin, both of which can inhibit plasmin activity and thereby contribute to thrombus formation.</p><p>Fibronectin within the CF complex may also interact with circulating immunoglobulins or immune complexes, and thus contribute an inflammatory component to the potentially prothrombotic nature of CF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryofibrinogenemia/abstract/6,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,16</a>]. An immunologic mechanism may play a significant role in the pathophysiology of cryofibrinogenemia associated with malignancies, infections, and connective tissue diseases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, cryofibrinogenemia has been associated with a number of disease states, but may also be present in otherwise healthy individuals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Asymptomatic cryofibrinogenemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some &quot;cases&quot; of cryofibrinogenemia are discovered incidentally upon testing of asymptomatic individuals. Several studies have estimated that the prevalence of asymptomatic cryofibrinogenemia is approximately 2 to 9 percent of normal subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryofibrinogenemia/abstract/5,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,17-19</a>]. In such studies, amounts of cryofibrinogen (CF) were typically less than 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L,</span> contrasting significantly with CF in patients with symptoms referable to cryofibrinogenemia, in whom levels often exceed 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L</span>. Indeed, significant levels of CF are quite rare in clinical practice, even among patients with cryoprecipitates: one study analyzed 335 patient samples with measurable cryoprecipitates, identifying only one as CF, the remainder as CGs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryofibrinogenemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Therefore, in the absence of appropriate clinical signs or symptoms, incidentally identified cryofibrinogenemia typically does not warrant further evaluation. However, the presence of high CF titers, or the presence of referable signs or symptoms (eg, cold sensitivity, Raynaud phenomenon), should prompt clinical evaluation for phenomena that warrant active treatment (eg, painful ulcers, history of thromboses). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below and <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with cryofibrinogenemia present in their fifth through seventh decade, with a modest female predominance. Signs and symptoms of circulating CF generally reflect cutaneous manifestations of cold-induced thromboses, increases in blood viscosity, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vascular reactivity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F102404\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102404 \">table 2</a>). Findings may include cold sensitivity, painful ulcers or skin necrosis, purpura, livedo reticularis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> painful or pruritic erythema (perniosis) of the extremities, as well as arthralgias and Raynaud phenomenon, although reported prevalences vary widely among studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryofibrinogenemia/abstract/11,12,17-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,17-24</a>].</p><p>Several other conditions have been associated with cryofibrinogenemia, though a causal relationship has not been proven. Among these, thrombotic events including stroke, myocardial infarction, limb and bowel ischemia or infarction, thrombophlebitis, pulmonary emboli, and ocular thrombi including retinal arterial <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> venous occlusions, as well as gangrene, have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryofibrinogenemia/abstract/19,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,25,26</a>].</p><p>Cryoprecipitates that contain both CF and immunoglobulins are more often found in association with secondary cryofibrinogenemia. This was illustrated by a study of 49 patients with cryofibrinogenemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryofibrinogenemia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Secondary cryofibrinogenemia, associated with connective tissue diseases, infections, or malignancies, was more common among patients with immunoglobulin-containing CF when compared with patients with isolated CF (79 versus 47 percent, respectively). The absence of immune components in the cryoprecipitate was associated with an increased incidence of cutaneous (77 versus 58 percent) and thrombotic (13 versus 3 percent) symptoms, typically characterized by cold-induced, painful, recurrent skin ulcers.</p><p>CF are often closely correlated with CG, where their presence may be associated with more severe CG vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryofibrinogenemia/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biopsies of skin lesions reveal occlusion of the small dermal vessels by fibrin and platelet thrombi with a perivascular mononuclear infiltrate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryofibrinogenemia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Similar findings have been described in the lung, muscle, and kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryofibrinogenemia/abstract/12,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,30</a>]. True leukocytoclastic vasculitis is atypical, though occasionally described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryofibrinogenemia/abstract/29,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,31</a>]. Other histopathologic features have been noted in cases with distal cold-induced painful <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pruritic lesions (perniosis) including interface dermatitis, lymphocytic infiltrates, dilated vessels, and mucinosis; these features are nonspecific and were shared by patients with perniosis due to systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrome, and hypergammaglobulinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryofibrinogenemia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence or absence of cryofibrinogen (CF) is determined by laboratory testing. However, making a diagnosis of clinically significant cryofibrinogenemia requires that in addition to having a circulating CF, a patient also have suggestive clinical features and histopathological demonstration of typical &quot;in situ&quot; thrombi.</p><p>Testing for CF could be considered in all patients who demonstrate typical clinical findings of cryofibrinogenemia, particularly in the presence of cold-related signs or symptoms, such as Raynaud phenomenon, cold sensitivity, or livedo reticularis. However, since treatment options are often limited to cold avoidance, many practitioners limit CF testing to patients with more severe manifestations, such as when such manifestations warrant active therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> in the presence of thromboses, ulcerations, or clinically significant cryoglobulinemia, which may coexist with cryofibrinogenemia.</p><p>Diagnostic criteria proposed for essential cryofibrinogenemia include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryofibrinogenemia/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compatible clinical presentation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of CF in plasma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of cryoglobulins (CGs)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of causes of secondary CF (eg, infection, neoplasm)</p><p/><p>Angiographically demonstrated abrupt complete occlusion of small to medium-sized arteries, or typical pathologic findings on biopsy of affected tissue, are also supportive findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryofibrinogenemia/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Possible benefit from use of anticoagulants has been reported, but is uncertain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h3\">Fibrinolytic approaches</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Agents that promote or cause fibrinolysis such as stanozolol, streptokinase, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a>, streptodornase, or urokinase have been reported to be beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryofibrinogenemia/abstract/12,29,33-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,29,33-37</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For severe, acute manifestations such as thrombosis, intravenous fibrinolytic therapy, such as with streptokinase (eg, 25,000 to 200,000 units daily) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a> (eg, 10 mg daily) may be indicated. Intravenous administration of these agents limits their potential as long-term therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For less acute manifestations, oral stanozolol (2 to 4 mg twice daily) can be effective. Several days of treatment may be needed before a beneficial effect is observed, limiting usefulness in acute settings.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h3\">Immune-based approaches</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunomodulatory approaches, including glucocorticoids, cytotoxic therapy, and plasmapheresis, may be of some limited value when used individually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryofibrinogenemia/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. Combinations of glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressive agents have also been used. As an example, in small studies the combined use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (10-60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> (150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorambucil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorambucil</a> (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> were both of benefit, including successful treatment of acute attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryofibrinogenemia/abstract/5,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,32</a>]. A case report of a patient with cold-induced necrotic lesions and an associated monoclonal paraprotein improved with a course of monthly intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryofibrinogenemia/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19725056\"><span class=\"h3\">Anticoagulant approaches</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Agents that inhibit coagulation, such as heparin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> in standard therapeutic doses, have also been reported in individual cases to be beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryofibrinogenemia/abstract/12,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,41</a>]. However, their use has also been associated with progression of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryofibrinogenemia/abstract/5,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,32</a>]. Thus, some experts do not endorse their routine use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryofibrinogenemia/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, in combination with corticosteroids, has been advocated for nonsevere symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryofibrinogenemia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h2\">Secondary cryofibrinogenemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In secondary cryofibrinogenemia, specific treatment of the underlying disease can lead to improvement in cryofibrinogenemia-related symptoms. Thus, for all patients with cryofibrinogenemia, age-appropriate malignancy screening and evaluation for possible underlying infection or systemic inflammatory disease are indicated. However, since the prevalence of various malignancies and infections in cryofibrinogenemia remain largely uncharacterized, work-up for underlying conditions should be directed by the patient's clinical presentation.</p><p>Patients with underlying systemic lupus erythematosus or other connective tissue diseases may respond to glucocorticoids, cytotoxic therapy, or plasmapheresis as dictated by their underlying disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryofibrinogenemia/abstract/42-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-45</a>], while patients with infections or malignancies may respond to specific antimicrobial therapy or oncologic interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryofibrinogenemia/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. Outcomes for such approaches, however, are limited to individual or small series case reports, making generalized statements regarding treatment difficult.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A person whose plasma, but not serum, forms a cryoprecipitate is referred to as having cryofibrinogenemia.
