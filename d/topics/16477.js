Adding to the complexity, many HIV-infected persons have difficulty with treatment adherence due to their behavior patterns as well as specific neuropsychiatric disorders associated with HIV disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-abuse-and-addiction-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Substance abuse and addiction in HIV-infected patients will be reviewed here. An overview of the range of neuropsychiatric conditions associated with HIV infection and more detailed reviews of other specific conditions are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-neuropsychiatric-aspects-of-hiv-infection-and-aids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the neuropsychiatric aspects of HIV infection and AIDS&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-associated-neurocognitive-disorders-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=depression-mania-and-schizophrenia-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Depression, mania, and schizophrenia in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Substance abuse is defined as a maladaptive pattern of substance use that has become socially, legally, or occupationally problematic for the individual. Substance dependence refers to tolerance or the physical need for a substance. Tolerance is the need to use increasing amounts of a substance in order to achieve the desired effect. While the term addiction has often been rejected due to the difficulty in developing a clear definition, it persists among clinicians because of its utility in describing patients. We define addiction as a pattern of increasing drug use in an increasingly stereotypical manner for intoxication despite increasing negative consequences of the behavior. &#160; </p><p>Dependence is divided into two components: physiological and psychological. An example that illustrates the difference between abuse and dependence is to compare the college fraternity student who becomes intoxicated at a fraternity party and behaves badly (alcohol abuse) with the retired businessman who drinks martinis on a daily basis and suffers tremors and anxiety when he stops drinking (alcohol dependence). Physiological dependence occurs when an individual has physically adapted to a substance to the point that he or she must continue using the substance in order to feel normal. If the physically dependent individual stops using the substance abruptly, he or she will experience uncomfortable physical withdrawal symptoms that could be relieved by using the substance. Psychological dependence occurs when the individual believes that he or she needs to continue using the substance to feel emotionally stable.</p><p>Primary substance abuse disorders include both substance abuse and dependence. Secondary substance-induced disorders include substance intoxication, substance withdrawal, substance-induced psychotic disorder, substance-induced mood disorder, substance-induced anxiety disorder, substance-induced sleep disorder, substance-induced persisting dementia disorder, substance-induced amnestic disorder, and substance-induced sexual dysfunction. These secondary disorders typically resolve with elimination of the underlying substance abuse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND HIV TRANSMISSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Substance abuse is a primary vector for the spread of HIV through engagement in a number of high-risk behaviors, either when intoxicated (disinhibited) or in order to obtain drugs. Such behaviors include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sharing of unclean needles</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prostitution</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risky sexual behavior (eg, not using condoms)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sexual contact within a high-risk population of injection drug users (IDUs)</p><p/><p>The proportion of IDUs with HIV infection markedly increased in the United States from 17 percent during the years 1981 to 1987 to 33 percent during 1993 to 1995. However, with the advent of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) and needle exchange programs in some cities, determining the incidence of HIV infection among IDUs has become more complex. While some studies show that the rate of acquisition of new infection has declined with more widespread use of antiretrovirals and needle exchange [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-abuse-and-addiction-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>], high-risk sexual behaviors may in some circumstances increase with the perception that HIV may be more treatable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-abuse-and-addiction-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Substance abuse also plays a major role in HIV transmission among non-injection drug users. For example, crack cocaine abusers are more likely to engage in prostitution in order to obtain money for drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-abuse-and-addiction-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]; men who use crack cocaine are more likely to engage in unprotected anal sex with casual male contacts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-abuse-and-addiction-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]; and alcohol intoxication precipitates risky sexual behaviors through cognitive impairment and disinhibition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-abuse-and-addiction-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">COMORBIDITIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extensive psychiatric, psychological, and medical comorbidities are associated with substance abuse and addiction in HIV disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychiatric comorbidity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most significant psychiatric comorbidity with HIV and substance abuse is major depression, which is associated with HIV and substance abuse at a prevalence rate of 15 to 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-abuse-and-addiction-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Depression is associated with worsening of addictions and resistance to treatment. While anhedonia in depression makes it difficult for any patient to respond to and enjoy life's rewards, potential rewards may especially pale for the HIV-infected substance abuser in comparison to the intense ephemeral charge of intoxicating drugs that stimulate the mesolimbic reward system of the brain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=depression-mania-and-schizophrenia-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Depression, mania, and schizophrenia in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Depressed patients often find it more difficult to engage in, invest in, and sustain treatment due to their anergy and negativism. It is thus essential to recognize and treat depression early in order to maximize successful treatment outcomes for both substance abuse and HIV disease. Because it may be difficult to distinguish transient depressive symptoms precipitated by drug withdrawal, demoralization or grief reactions from the persistent depressive symptoms of a major affective disorder, it may be necessary to observe the substance abuse patient over a sustained period of abstinence in order to accurately diagnose depression.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Personality comorbidity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Personality factors, as described more fully below, may lead to greater risk taking and increased sensitivity to rewards. An increased tendency to take risks subsequently precipitates greater likelihood to engage in high-risk behaviors, while greater sensitivity to rewards is associated with increased sensitivity to the reinforcing properties of drugs and decreased sensitivity to the consequences of drug use. On the other hand, personality types that are consequence- and risk-avoidant are relatively protected from addiction.</p><p>Maladaptive personality traits, generally found in the cluster B personality disorders in DSM-5 (antisocial, borderline, narcissistic, and histrionic), are present in as many as 49 percent of all substance abusers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-abuse-and-addiction-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. It is critical to identify personality vulnerabilities in these patients because they have profound effects on treatment and prognosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical comorbidity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with concurrent drug use disorders, another psychiatric disorder, and HIV are abundant in HIV treatment settings because of their symptom severity and chronicity. In inner city Baltimore, for example, 44 percent of new entrants to the HIV medical clinic at Johns Hopkins had an active substance abuse disorder, and 24 percent of these patients had both a current substance use disorder and another nonsubstance-related Axis I diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-abuse-and-addiction-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Accumulation of medical sequelae from chronic substance abuse accelerates immunocompromise and amplifies accumulating burdens of HIV infection. Injection drug users (IDUs), for example, have a higher risk of developing pneumonia, sepsis, soft tissue infections, and infective endocarditis. Tuberculosis, sexually transmitted diseases, viral hepatitis, and coinfection with human T-lymphotropic virus types I and II also occur more commonly among HIV-infected IDUs.</p><p>Diagnosis and treatment of comorbid conditions is often difficult because there is substantial overlap between clinical manifestations of substance abuse and sequelae of HIV infection. For example, both AIDS dementia and drug intoxication can present with apathy, disorientation, aggression and altered consciousness, and both drug withdrawal and opportunistic infections of the central nervous system can present with seizures and neurovegetative symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-associated-neurocognitive-disorders-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-hiv-infected-patients-with-central-nervous-system-lesions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to HIV-infected patients with central nervous system lesions&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The duration of survival in HIV-infected IDUs has improved substantially since 1997 with the introduction of effective antiretroviral therapy, reaching rates similar to those in HIV-seronegative IDUs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-abuse-and-addiction-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, clinicians must be especially mindful of interactions among antiretroviral agents, drugs HIV-infected patients may take to prevent opportunistic infections, and substances that these patients may abuse. Opioid users, for example, are at particular risk for medication interactions. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rifampin</a> increases the rate of elimination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> from the body and may result in the rapid onset of withdrawal symptoms in patients on methadone maintenance therapy. Decreased plasma levels of methadone also occur with concurrent administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ritonavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ritonavir</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nelfinavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nelfinavir</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=efavirenz-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">efavirenz</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nevirapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nevirapine</a>, which necessitates adjustments in methadone maintenance if withdrawal should occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-abuse-and-addiction-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Antiretroviral medications such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=didanosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">didanosine</a> may also cause peripheral neuropathies that can be worsened by the neurotoxic effects of alcohol and malnutrition related to chronic substance abuse. However, with the advent of newer antiretroviral agents with less mitochondrial toxicity, safer alternatives are now available.</p><p>Of particular relevance to the HIV-infected population is coinfection with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Some clinics have reported that 50 percent of HIV-infected patients are also infected with HCV, and coinfection may be as high as 70 percent among IDUs. Underlying HIV infection appears to facilitate. HCV progression to cirrhosis and liver failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-natural-history-and-diagnosis-of-hepatitis-c-in-the-hiv-infected-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, natural history, and diagnosis of hepatitis C in the HIV-infected patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although very little is known about specific psychiatric disturbances in <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/HCV</span> coinfected patients, neuropsychiatric complications of treatment with interferon (IFN)-alpha, a mainstay of therapy for HCV, are well known. IFN-alpha has been associated with depressive syndromes, suicide and mania. Patients with preexisting depression or bipolar disorder are more likely to develop affective symptoms while receiving IFN-alpha but may not be more likely to stop treatment than patients developing these symptoms &quot;de novo&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-abuse-and-addiction-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Patients coinfected with HIV and HCV should be screened for mental illness, and mental health monitoring should be performed during the period of treatment with IFN-alpha to achieve early recognition and treatment of affective symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS IN HIV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A simplified series of steps for substance abuse in HIV patients includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acceptance of the role as a patient</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Detoxification</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rehabilitation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of comorbid conditions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintenance treatment and relapse prevention</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Acceptance of patient role</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most daunting task in treatment of drug addiction is often initial engagement and guiding the individual to accept the role of a patient to achieve longer-term health goals. Whereas individuals who are addicted to drugs tend to present to treatment settings for comfort or crisis relief, medical care providers are focused on long-range goals of improving health and overall functioning. It is the task of the healthcare provider to guide the patient's attitudes to coincide with those of the provider's treatment plan. Here, a number of stages that a patient goes through (transtheoretical stages of change) provide a framework for viewing the recovery process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-abuse-and-addiction-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Precontemplation &mdash; Patient has no intention of altering addictive behavior</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contemplation &mdash; Patient has considered change, often after recognizing negative consequences of his or her drug use, but remains ambivalent to change</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preparation &mdash; The patient shows intent to change by making initial steps to seek treatment</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Action &mdash; The patient decides to modify behavior, environment and circumstances in order to relinquish his or her addictive lifestyle</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintenance &mdash; The patient works to prevent relapse through consolidation of changed behavior and lifestyle</p><p/><p>The most difficult transition in truly accepting the patient role is from contemplation to action. Using empathy and confrontation to amplify the discrepancy between current lifestyle and long-term life enhancing goals is essential. Motivational interviewing is a nonconfrontational intervention that can help transition patients through this process. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=motivational-interviewing-for-substance-use-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Motivational interviewing for substance use disorders&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Detoxification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is virtually impossible for intoxicated patients to understand and process the cognitive steps needed for recovery without first undergoing detoxification. Slowly tapering either the drug of dependence or using a cross-dependent drug with similar pharmacologic mechanism best accomplishes this goal.</p><p>There is no evidence to support the notion that noxious withdrawal during detoxification improves outcome. Rather, some studies suggest that patients suffering through severe withdrawal develop conditioned withdrawal such that exposure to environments similar to the one experienced during severe withdrawal can bring back withdrawal symptoms months later. Effort should be directed to help patients remain reasonably comfortable during drug withdrawal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-moderate-and-severe-alcohol-withdrawal-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of moderate and severe alcohol withdrawal syndromes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-opioid-intoxication-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute opioid intoxication in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Sedative-hypnotic drugs that enhance gamma-aminobutyric acid transmission, such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and alcohol, cause a withdrawal that can be life threatening, and patients should be slowly tapered with long-acting benzodiazepines such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlordiazepoxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlordiazepoxide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxazepam</a>. Detoxification from opiates is accomplished through taper of long-acting opioid agonists, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a>, slow release <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a>, or slow release <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxycodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxycodone</a>. The use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buprenorphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buprenorphine</a>, a partial opioid agonist, can be problematic in higher dose users, as it can precipitate withdrawal in dependent patients. Most heroin users or those who are using modest opiate doses can be effectively tapered using buprenorphine, but for patients on high doses of opiates (usually for chronic pain), an experienced clinician should be consulted before using a buprenorphine taper. The uncomfortable symptoms of sedative-hypnotic and opiate detoxification can be ameliorated with several adjunctive medications, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyzine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyzine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methocarbamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methocarbamol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a>, and valproic acid. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of comorbid psychiatric conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Comorbid psychiatric conditions should be treated in order to maximize compliance and abstinence. Conditions such as major depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia are best managed with the pharmacologic strategies routinely employed for other patients with these disorders. Medications should be started at low doses and titrated slowly to minimize development of adverse side effects and delirium. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=depression-mania-and-schizophrenia-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Depression, mania, and schizophrenia in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Personality disorders may manifest as staff splitting, doctor shopping, general noncompliance, and manipulative behavior. These symptoms are magnified by the discomforts of withdrawal and the discomforts of facing the consequences of addictive behaviors during the early periods of sobriety. These individuals are best managed through psychotherapy with firm limit setting and consistency on the part of all their health care providers. There should be a documented treatment plan with clear goals agreed upon by all treatment staff. This treatment plan should be reviewed with patients at the initiation of treatment so that they clearly understand what is expected of them and what they can expect from the treatment providers if they are adherent to the stated goals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Maintenance treatment and relapse prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because HIV-infected patients with substance abuse problems are complicated and vulnerable to recidivism, an integrated approach to long-term treatment should include a treatment team of medical providers, psychiatrists, social workers, housing counselors, daycare workers, and substance abuse counselors. Group therapy is also important because more experienced members of the group can provide both confrontation and support for newly initiated members and a positive view of the benefits of recovery.</p><p>Commitment to a community of recovery fosters protection from the influences of the drug community and provides new bonds that help maintain a sense of purposefulness and hopefulness. Specific HIV-positive recovery groups are also available. Although these groups specifically address HIV-related issues, they are not necessary for recovery from substance abuse.</p><p>Individual and family therapies can enhance the treatment, but they should not replace group therapy. Successful therapy generally focuses on identifying triggers to substance use, minimizing exposure to substances, and defining a clear plan of action if relapse occurs. Relapse is often the rule rather than the exception, and prophylactic plans should be made for early intervention. Monitoring measures such as urine and serum toxicologies and Breathalyzer tests can help enforce compliance, and contingency management using positive and negative reinforcers linked to urine toxicology results are highly effective in helping patients maintain sobriety.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H441198507\"><span class=\"h2\">Adjunctive pharmacotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pharmacologic approaches to maintenance and relapse prevention can be divided into aversive therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disulfiram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">disulfiram</a> for alcohol abuse), blockade of reinforcement (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naltrexone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naltrexone</a> for opioid abuse), drive suppression (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a> or naltrexone for tobacco abuse, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buprenorphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buprenorphine</a> for cocaine abuse) and substituted addiction (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a>, LAAM, or buprenorphine for opioid abuse). Because relapse can occur impulsively in a single moment, many patients benefit from and appreciate these strategies.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=disulfiram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Disulfiram</a> inhibits acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, causing accumulation of acetaldehyde after alcohol ingestion, which results in nausea, flushing, headaches, and hypotension. Due to the risk of hepatotoxicity, liver enzymes should be monitored during disulfiram treatment. It has rarely been successful as a monotherapy for alcohol, but may be useful in preventing relapse in a situation known to have triggers (such as attending a wedding where alcohol will be served). </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=naltrexone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Naltrexone</a> is an opioid antagonist with high affinity for mu receptors that is taken once daily in doses ranging from 50 to 100 mg or as a monthly injection. Naltrexone blocks the euphoric effects of opioids and makes opiate use unrewarding (blocks the &ldquo;high&rdquo;). As with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disulfiram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">disulfiram</a>, liver function tests should be monitored in patients taking naltrexone due to a risk of hepatotoxicity. A caution is that it must be started carefully as it precipitates withdrawal symptoms in dependent individuals. Naltrexone has also been shown to reduce alcohol craving. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-alcohol-use-disorder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for alcohol use disorder&quot;</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methadone</a> is the opioid agonist most traditionally used for opiate maintenance treatment, in varying doses from 40 to 140 mg daily. Methadone is administered under daily supervision until the patient has established a pattern of abstinence, at which point take-home doses are allowed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-opioid-use-disorder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for opioid use disorder&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The partial agonist <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buprenorphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buprenorphine</a> is a useful alternative to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a>, and has the advantage that it can be administered by primary care physicians to opiate-dependent individuals, thereby removing the stigma associated with daily visits to drug treatment centers that can be a barrier to medication adherence. It is best used as part of a treatment program and not simply a drug solution to addiction. A primary care provider must be certified through an authorized training program, obtain a waiver from the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4847512\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Substance abuse is defined as a maladaptive pattern of substance use that has become socially, legally, or occupationally problematic for the individual.
