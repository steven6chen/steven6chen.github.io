An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is defined as a dilated aorta with a diameter at least 1.5 times the diameter measured at the level of the renal arteries. In most individuals, the diameter of the normal abdominal aorta is approximately 2.0 cm (range 1.4 to 3.0 cm). For practical purposes, an AAA is diagnosed when the aortic diameter exceeds 3.0 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The majority of aneurysms never rupture, but when they do, sudden death from retroperitoneal or intraperitoneal exsanguination is usual unless surgery or endovascular repair is performed immediately. Acute AAA rupture is one of the most dramatic emergencies in medicine, particularly because it often masquerades as another problem. In the United States, ruptured AAA is estimated to cause 4 to 5 percent of sudden deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>A byproduct of the increasing use of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the discovery of asymptomatic and previously undiagnosed AAAs. The concern raised by people who become incidentally aware of a &quot;ticking bomb&quot; in their abdomen presents a common dilemma to clinicians. The decision to perform elective endovascular or surgical repair to prevent aneurysm rupture must be weighed against immediate procedural risks in an often older adult population and the low likelihood that a rupture will occur before death from other causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The trade-off between present and future risk should involve patient preference as an important consideration in the decision to screen for an AAA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm#H611107773\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Introduction'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The dilemmas associated with the incidental discovery of an AAA make decisions regarding screening difficult. Systematic population screening would yield many previously undiagnosed small aneurysms that are unlikely to rupture, resulting in needless disease labeling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Only aneurysms of a certain size would be considered for endovascular or surgical repair, with smaller aneurysms subject to watchful waiting.</p><p>Issues related to screening for AAAs will be reviewed here.

The prevalence of screening-detected AAA was 1.5 percent. After a mean of 4.5 years, 29 percent of patients with AAA had undergone endovascular or surgical repair. Screening significantly reduced the incidence of AAA-specific mortality (mean 4 percent per year of screening). The number needed to screen to prevent one premature death was 667, and the number needed to repair to prevent one premature death was 1.5. With a total population of 9.5 million, the Swedish national AAA-screening program was predicted to prevent 90 premature deaths from AAA annually and gain 577 QALYs.

The combination of male sex and age &ge;65 years, and either smoking &gt;100 cigarettes in a lifetime or having a family history of AAA repair or rupture, places a patient at high risk of AAA. Among women, the combination of age &gt;65 years and a family history of AAA elevates risk somewhat above the average range.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3286361744\"><span class=\"h2\">Shared decision-making</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to explore patient preferences and to explain the benefits and harms of screening. An abdominal ultrasound is a simple test that does not itself carry risks to the patient. However, the test may detect a small aneurysm for which regular follow-up will be recommended, which may result in anxiety for the patient. Many small aneurysms will never grow sufficiently to warrant surgical repair, and, for those patients, knowing of an AAA may cause worry and may or may not have been of benefit, depending in part on whether the patient makes medication or lifestyle changes that could affect morbidity or mortality from other diseases (eg, smoking cessation). However, some AAAs will grow, and the patient may then choose to have elective repair and thus avoid an AAA rupture with its significant risk of mortality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2343418698\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening high-risk patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend one-time screening for AAA with abdominal ultrasonography in men ages 65 to 75 who have ever smoked. We also suggest one-time screening with abdominal ultrasonography in men ages 65 to 75 who have a first-degree relative who required AAA repair or died from AAA rupture. We offer screening to women who have a strong family history of either AAA repair or death due to AAA rupture, basing the decision to screen upon their values and preferences. Screening generally is not indicated for other women, although data are limited.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">MAJOR SOCIETY AND GOVERNMENTAL GUIDELINES AND POLICIES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H151211802\"><span class=\"h2\">The US Preventive Services Task Force</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm-screening&amp;token=RP2Zqac1tFTM6a1DeNFI0ZrCXMsbPE7IE/u/3D4kq5fawm1rKYM6T6SAl4eV/3RHT5/jY9y4wHg96R3/He2PIrypNlndvQap9LNJJZ+lgsr6AjloZnXGxruvJjoeKDuAjKpIpEA81FmFgxKL3qbzpw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=4845\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) AAA Screening</a> makes the following recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/42,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,73</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The USPSTF recommends one-time screening with ultrasonography in men ages 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively offer screening for AAA in men ages 65 to 75 who have never smoked, based on the patient's medical history, family history, other risk factors, and the patient&rsquo;s preferences</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The USPSTF concludes that evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening women aged 65 to 75 who have ever smoked</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The USPSTF recommends against routine screening for women who have never smoked</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H151211814\"><span class=\"h2\">Major United States professional societies</span></p><p>In 2005, the American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC/AHA)</span> published guidelines on peripheral artery disease in conjunction with major societies in vascular medicine, vascular surgery, and interventional radiology, including the Society for Vascular Surgery and the Society for Vascular Medicine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].
