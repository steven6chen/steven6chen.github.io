Fever can be the sole manifestation of an adverse drug reaction in 3 to 5 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The risk of developing drug fever increases with the number of drugs prescribed, especially in older adult patients. Individuals with active HIV infection also appear to have an increased susceptibility to drug reactions of all types, including fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p>The recognition of drug fever is clinically important. Failure to recognize the etiologic relationship between a drug and fever often has undesired consequences including extra testing, unnecessary therapy, and longer hospital stays.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For the purpose of this discussion, drug fever is defined as &quot;a disorder characterized by fever coinciding with administration of a drug and disappearing after the discontinuation of the drug, when no other cause for the fever is evident after a careful physical examination and laboratory investigation&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Others have applied definitions such as &quot;the febrile response to a drug without cutaneous manifestations&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], but, in our view, such a definition is overly restrictive. Data on drug fever are largely derived from hundreds of single case reports and a few small series. There are no controlled trials on this subject, and reporting bias may significantly distort our view.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanisms of drug fever are multiple and, in many cases, are poorly or incompletely understood. However, most authorities classify drug-related fevers into five broad categories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/1,2,7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,7-9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypersensitivity reactions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Altered thermoregulatory mechanisms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reactions that are directly related to administration of the drug</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reactions that are direct extensions of the pharmacologic action of the drug</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Idiosyncratic reactions</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Fever associated with hypersensitivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypersensitivity is the most common cause of drug fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/1-3,6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,6-8</a>]. Various mechanisms can cause fever, including the formation of circulating antibody-antigen complexes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a T cell immune response provoked by a drug or its metabolites. Any one episode may involve multiple antigenic determinants and mechanisms. Fever is occasionally recognized when certain drugs are used in combination, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> in the treatment of refractory rheumatoid arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Many clinicians are reluctant to diagnose a drug fever due to hypersensitivity if the patient has been on the drug for a period of time. However, the timing of the onset of fever due to hypersensitivity is often not a reliable diagnostic clue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/7,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11</a>]. In most cases, fever appears several days to three weeks after the drug has been started, but the lag time can be as long as several years. On the other hand, fever can arise within hours of a rechallenge, intentional or otherwise, in a previously sensitized patient.</p><p>Withdrawal of the offending drug usually results in defervescence within 72 to 96 hours, which helps to confirm the diagnosis, but delays of five to seven days have been observed. The issue of rechallenge is discussed below.</p><p>Febrile drug reactions, often associated with a rash, are common in patients with active HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/3,12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12-14</a>]. Mechanisms are probably multifactorial, involving both hypersensitivity and direct toxicity of drug metabolites. The febrile reaction to some antiretroviral drugs, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a>, may be genetically determined and prevented with pharmacogenetic testing prior to commencement of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The new onset of drug reactions in a previously healthy person may even lead a clinician to suspect the diagnosis of HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-hypersensitivity-reaction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abacavir hypersensitivity reaction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-and-rash-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fever and rash in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Drug fever due to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a>, a prostaglandin analog used for treatment of postpartum hemorrhage and termination of pregnancy, may also be genetically determined; however, there is no routinely available pharmacogenetic test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>An unusually high incidence of drug fever is also seen in patients with cystic fibrosis. The parenteral beta-lactams, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piperacillin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piperacillin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipenem-and-cilastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipenem</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/cilastatin</span> seem to be particularly likely to cause fever in this patient population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40988538\"><span class=\"h3\">Associations with specific agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although virtually any drug is capable of causing fever via a hypersensitivity mechanism, five drugs or drug classes deserve special mention, as discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h4\">Anticonvulsants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aromatic anticonvulsants such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenobarbital</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">primidone</a> are important causes of drug fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/18-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-22</a>]. The estimated incidence is 1 reaction per 5000 treated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Fever usually begins five to six days after commencement of the drug and may be accompanied by an illness resembling infectious mononucleosis or even a pseudolymphoma syndrome. When the drug is discontinued, there may be slow resolution of fever and lymphadenopathy, taking from two to six weeks.</p><p>Skin reactions often accompany fever. Most patients have a morbilliform skin rash, but some develop severe skin reactions including Steven Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis, which can be fatal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Some patients develop concurrent hepatitis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> interstitial nephritis, but virtually any organ of the body may be damaged in patients with the anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome.</p><p>A family history of a drug hypersensitivity reaction should alert physicians to the possibility of familial inheritance of abnormal drug detoxification pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Clinicians also need to be aware that cross-sensitivity may occur between drugs in this class.</p><p>Anticonvulsants are also associated with the drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H40988394\" class=\"local\">'DRESS syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h4\">Minocycline</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=minocycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Minocycline</a> is a widely used antimicrobial agent, especially for the treatment of acne. Long-term minocycline therapy is also sometimes used for patients with osteomyelitis or prosthetic-related infection due to methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Various febrile reactions have been reported, some associated with joint, lung, liver, and skin involvement and often accompanied by eosinophilia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>]. In most of these reports, patients were taking minocycline for many months to years before the reaction occurred; this may result in the drug being overlooked as the cause of the fever.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h4\">Other antimicrobial agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antimicrobials, along with antipyretics, are the most common drugs to be prescribed for febrile illnesses; antimicrobial agents are also the most common cause of drug fever, accounting for approximately one-third of episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This especially applies to beta-lactams, sulfonamides, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrofurantoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrofurantoin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Drug fever due to an antimicrobial agent can cause clinical confusion because the return of a fever in an infected patient who has defervesced on antimicrobial treatment may be misinterpreted as relapse of the original infection. Unless drug fever is considered, further investigations usually follow; the drug is changed or other antimicrobials added; and treatment is unnecessarily prolonged or complicated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h4\">Allopurinol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Allopurinol</a> is an uncommon but important cause of drug fever. It is usually prescribed for the prevention of gout but is also used to diminish tumor lysis syndrome in patients receiving chemotherapy for malignancy. Allopurinol-induced fever is often accompanied by hepatotoxicity, deterioration of renal function, severe rash, and eosinophilia (60 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Allopurinol</a> should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of fever in patients taking this drug. There is probably a genetic predisposition and the reaction is more likely to occur in the presence of drug accumulation, especially when there is renal impairment <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> concurrent use of thiazide diuretics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Allopurinol</a> is also associated with DRESS syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H40988394\" class=\"local\">'DRESS syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h4\">Heparin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heparin is a rare cause of drug fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Heparin-induced fever can be particularly difficult to diagnose in critically ill or postoperative patients who often receive the drug for prophylaxis against thromboembolism. To date, low molecular weight heparins do not appear to cause drug fever.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40988394\"><span class=\"h3\">DRESS syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although fever may be the sole manifestation of drug hypersensitivity reactions, some patients may develop severe and even life-threatening illness with multiorgan dysfunction. One specific variant of severe hypersensitivity reactions has come to be known as DRESS syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. DRESS syndrome can be caused by numerous drugs, most commonly anticonvulsants, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a>, sulfonamides and related drugs, other antibiotics, and even nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F86760\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86760 \">table 1</a>). In addition to eosinophilia, patients with DRESS syndrome typically have a diffuse morbilliform rash, lymphadenopathy, atypical lymphocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and hepatitis sometimes with abnormalities of lung and kidney function. There is often reactivation of herpes viruses, notably human herpes virus 6 and 7 viremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. The latency period between drug exposure and onset of illness is typically two to six weeks. DRESS syndrome has a reported mortality of 5 to 10 percent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-reaction-with-eosinophilia-and-systemic-symptoms-dress\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Fever due to altered thermoregulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A wide array of drugs can cause fever by disrupting the normal thermoregulatory mechanisms of the body. Body temperature is primarily regulated by the anterior hypothalamus, balancing heat loss via the periphery against heat production by the tissues. Normally, the body's &quot;thermostat&quot; is set at just below 37&ordm;C with a diurnal variation of about 1&ordm;C.</p><p>Hyperthermia occurs when metabolic production of heat exceeds heat dissipation. Fever, which is a regulated response, occurs when the thermoregulatory center is reset at a higher temperature by &quot;endogenous pyrogens,&quot; including the cytokines interleukin (IL)-1 alpha and -1 beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and -beta, and interferon alpha [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In response to infection, inflammation, injury, or antigenic challenge, specific host cells produce these pyrogenic polypeptides. Cyclooxygenase and local prostaglandin E2 levels in turn mediate the temperature-resetting mechanism, which includes muscle activity (shivering), vasomotor tone of the skin, and sweating.</p><p>Determinants of body temperature include the time of day, age, severe debility, thyroid function, and treatment with glucocorticoid and antiprostaglandin agents. Raised body temperature is most commonly due to the febrile response, but other mechanisms include abnormal hypothalamic function, decreased heat dissipation, and increased heat production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Drugs can alter or modify all of the mechanisms described above in the following ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exogenous thyroid hormone can increase the metabolic rate and directly increase heat production.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drugs with anticholinergic activity, such as tricyclic antidepressants, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a>, antihistamines, phenothiazines, and butyrophenone tranquilizers can cause fever by disturbing central hypothalamic function and the peripheral effector mechanisms detailed above. Marked hyperthermia can ensue when these drugs are taken in combination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/2,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7,8</a>]. Oligohydrosis and hyperthermia has also been reported with the antiepileptic drug <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zonisamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zonisamide</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sympathomimetic agents such as amphetamines, cocaine, and related agents cause peripheral vasoconstriction as a result of disturbances in central hypothalamic function and peripheral effector mechanisms. In addition, drug-induced psychomotor agitation may in turn lead to increased muscle activity and secondary heat production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. 3,4-methylene dioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or &quot;ecstasy&quot;) is a recreational drug with sympathomimetic properties that can cause a potentially fatal acute syndrome characterized by hyperthermia, seizures, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and coagulopathy, especially when taken prior to vigorous exercise, such as dancing. It is likely that this reaction is also related to the serotonin syndrome (see below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Fever associated with drug administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The parenteral administration of a wide variety of drugs can directly lead to fever. Solutions containing drugs can become contaminated with endotoxin or other exogenous pyrogens. Fever can also accompany a chemical phlebitis caused by drug administration, and local inflammation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sterile abscesses can occur at sites of injection. Fever sometimes follows injections with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paraldehyde-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paraldehyde</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentazocine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentazocine</a>, and other drugs. Many routine vaccinations are associated with low-grade fever for 48 hours or less.</p><p>Pyrogenic contaminants in intravenous fluids are occasionally responsible for dramatic febrile episodes with rigors and hypotension that usually occur shortly after the infusion has commenced. This may cause considerable confusion during the perioperative period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Some drugs, such as amphotericin B and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a>, have intrinsic but poorly understood pyrogenic properties. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-of-amphotericin-b\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology of amphotericin B&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the past, fever sometimes resulted from drug impurities; this was a particular problem with earlier, less highly purified formulations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Fever as an extension of the pharmacologic effect of a drug</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common example of fever as an extension of the pharmacologic effect of the drug is the fever observed following chemotherapy for various solid tumors, lymphomas, and leukemias. Cell necrosis and lysis release various pyrogenic substances from damaged cells; the resulting inflammatory response is also accompanied by cytokine activation of the febrile response. Fever most commonly commences three to four days after chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>] and may last for one week or more. This early febrile response usually can be distinguished from febrile neutropenia, which rarely develops before the second week after chemotherapy.</p><p>Drug fever can occur when BRAF inhibitors and <span class=\"nowrap\">BRAF/MEK</span> inhibitor combinations are used for treatment of metastatic melanoma. Most notably, the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabrafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dabrafenib</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trametinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trametinib</a> causes fever in 40 to 60 percent of people; the mechanism is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

Fever and transient exacerbation of constitutional symptoms are thought to result from the sudden release of bacterial products from injured <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> killed bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Classically, this reaction was described following treatment for secondary and tertiary syphilis, brucellosis, and enteric fever. It can also occur with treatment of schistosomiasis and trypanosomiasis.</p><p>Severe reactions of this type have been observed following treatment of borreliosis, particularly <em>Borrelia recurrentis</em>, with a mortality rate of approximately 5 percent (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-relapsing-fever\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and management of relapsing fever&quot;</a>). In one study of 49 patients with proven louse-borne relapsing fever, pretreatment with anti-TNF-alpha antibodies reduced the incidence of rigors from 90 percent in placebo recipients to 50 percent, and the mean increase in temperature from 1.5&ordm;C to only 0.8&ordm;C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Fever due to an idiosyncratic reaction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Febrile idiosyncratic drug reactions are a heterogeneous category of drug-induced fevers.

The condition is inherited as an autosomal-dominant trait in 50 percent of cases and thought to be present in 1 in 15,000 to 1 in 40,000 of the general population. Fifty percent of clinical cases occur in children. The primary defect is a mutation in the gene for the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RyR1), which is a calcium channel found in the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

The probability of developing NMS is directly related to the antidopaminergic potency of the neuroleptic agent. Abrupt withdrawal of dopaminergic agents also can precipitate NMS.

Serotonin syndrome is a predictable consequence of excess agonist activity of serotonin on central and peripheral 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Features include agitation, confusion, hyperthermia, and autonomic hyperactivity such as diaphoresis, tachycardia, and neuromuscular disturbances, including rigidity, clonus, and tremors. Serotonin syndrome is increasingly common because of the widespread use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in the treatment of various psychiatric disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. It may also be precipitated alone or in combination by L-tryptophan, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=linezolid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">linezolid</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>], lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a>, L-dopa, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dextromethorphan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dextromethorphan</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tramadol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tramadol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meperidine-pethidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meperidine</a>, and the monoamine oxidase inhibitors.

The first assumption of most clinicians is that fever is due to infection, which may not always be easy to exclude. Connective tissue diseases and malignancy, which are other causes of fever of unknown origin, are also often difficult to exclude (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiologies-of-fever-of-unknown-origin-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiologies of fever of unknown origin in adults&quot;</a>). Thus, in hospitalized patients, undiagnosed drug fever may prolong the hospitalization and result in extensive and expensive investigation. In one large study, hospital stay was prolonged by a mean of 8.7 days per episode, generating an average of 5 blood cultures and 2.85 radiologic studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Presence of rash</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rash, when present, may be a valuable clue to the presence of drug fever, but its absence should not deter the clinician from suspecting the diagnosis. In one series of 51 episodes of drug fever, rash occurred in only 18 percent of cases and was rarely urticarial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Fever patterns</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As mentioned above, the timing of the onset of fever in relation to beginning the drug and the pattern of fever are frequently not helpful in making a diagnosis. The median time to onset is about eight days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] but varies from less than 24 hours to many months. Similarly, the pattern of fever may vary from a low-grade fever without other associated symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] to a &quot;hectic&quot; pattern with chills and rigors. The latter pattern was observed in approximately 40 percent of hospitalized patients in one report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The spiking pattern of fever in such patients can be exacerbated by regular treatment with antipyretics.</p><p>Some patients with drug fever look severely ill, as if they were profoundly septic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]; others look and feel surprisingly well while febrile. Relative bradycardia, in which there is a large dissociation between the temperature and pulse rate, can occasionally be a useful clue to the presence of drug fever but occurs in only about 10 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory investigations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The white blood cell count can be elevated with accompanying eosinophilia in drug fever, but these findings occur in less than 20 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-fever/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), are often increased, but this is a nonspecific finding. Unexplained disturbance of liver function <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> renal impairment can provide clues to the diagnosis. If urine microscopy reveals pyuria, a stain for eosinophils can be performed and may be positive, especially in interstitial nephritis caused by beta-lactam antibiotics.

In clinical practice, rechallenge is not often performed.

Fever can be the sole manifestation of an adverse drug reaction in 3 to 5 percent of cases. The risk of developing drug fever increases with the number of drugs prescribed, especially in older adult patients. Patients with HIV infection also appear to have an increased susceptibility to drug reactions of all types, including fever. Failure to recognize the etiologic relationship between a drug and fever often has undesired consequences including extra testing, unnecessary therapy, and longer hospital stays.
