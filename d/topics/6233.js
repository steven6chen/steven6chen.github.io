Mumps occurs most commonly among school-aged children and college-aged young adults; it is rare among infants less than one year of age, who have protection via maternal antibodies.</p><p>Before the United States mumps vaccination program began in 1967, about 186,000 cases were reported each year; the actual number of cases was likely much higher due to underreporting. Since implementation of routine vaccination, there has been a more than 99 percent decrease in mumps cases in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mumps/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

The number of cases reported in 2016 and 2017 (6369 and 5629, respectively) were the highest in a decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mumps/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3825225876\"><span class=\"h2\">Transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mumps is highly infectious and is transmitted by respiratory droplets, direct contact, or fomites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mumps/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Mumps spreads rapidly among susceptible individuals living in close quarters, such as young adults living in college dormitories. Infection among school-aged children may be associated with further spread to household family members.</p><p>Viral shedding in respiratory secretions precedes the onset of symptomatic illness. The incubation period is usually 16 to 18 days (range 12 to 25 days) from exposure to onset of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mumps/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Individuals with mumps are typically infectious from two days before until five days after onset of parotitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mumps/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2480787895\"><span class=\"h2\">Outbreaks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several sporadic mumps outbreaks (the occurrence of &ge;3 cases linked by place and time) have occurred among susceptible individuals in a variety of settings, including military posts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mumps/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], schools [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mumps/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>], colleges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mumps/abstract/17-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-22</a>], and summer camps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mumps/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].

During outbreaks, mumps cases have occurred among vaccinated individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mumps/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]; high vaccination coverage helps limit the size, duration, and spread of mumps.

Parotitis may be unilateral or bilateral; initial unilateral involvement is followed by contralateral involvement a few days later in 90 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mumps/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Parotid swelling can last up to 10 days.</p><p>On physical examination, parotid swelling may obscure the angle of the mandible (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F53503\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53503 \">picture 1</a>), and the orifice of Stensen's duct is erythematous and enlarged (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F115303\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115303 \">figure 2</a>).

Asymptomatic infection occurs in 15 to 20 percent of cases; it is more common in adults than in children.

Of these, 82 percent had parotitis approximately 10 days prior to development of orchitis, and 91 percent had never received mumps vaccination. In another series including 67 men with orchitis (unilateral in 90 percent and bilateral in 10 percent), approximately half required hospitalization, and nine patients also had mumps meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mumps/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Testicular atrophy has been observed in 30 to 50 percent of unvaccinated patients following mumps orchitis, and decreased fertility has been reported in cases of bilateral orchitis; however, these complications are uncommon and sterility is very rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mumps/abstract/46,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,48</a>].

Viral parotitis may be distinguished from suppurative (bacterial) parotitis by a prodromal period followed by acute swelling of the involved gland, which can last 5 to 10 days and is often bilateral. Viral parotitis does not cause a purulent discharge from Stensen's duct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mumps/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>].

This is because the immune response to EBV produces a polyclonal B cell stimulation with broadly reactive cross-reacting antibodies.

Since implementation of routine vaccination in the United States, there has been a more than 99 percent decrease in mumps cases; a few hundred to a few thousand cases continue to occur each year (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F110959\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110959 \">figure 1</a>). During outbreaks, mumps cases have occurred among vaccinated individuals; however, high vaccination coverage helps limit the size, duration, and spread of mumps. (See <a href=\"#H3307335150\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2480787895\" class=\"local\">'Outbreaks'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mumps virus is highly infectious and is transmitted by respiratory droplets, direct contact, or fomites. Viral shedding in respiratory secretions precedes the onset of symptomatic illness. The incubation period is usually 16 to 18 days (range 12 to 25 days) from exposure to onset of symptoms. Individuals with mumps are typically infectious from three days before until nine days after onset of symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H3825225876\" class=\"local\">'Transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mumps typically begins with a few days of fever, headache, myalgia, fatigue, and anorexia; these symptoms and signs are usually followed by development of salivary gland swelling within 48 hours. Parotitis may be unilateral or bilateral; initial unilateral involvement may be followed by contralateral involvement a few days later. Parotid swelling can last up to 10 days. Mumps is usually self-limited; most individuals recover completely within a few weeks. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications of mumps include orchitis or oophoritis, neurologic manifestations (including meningitis, encephalitis and deafness), and other less common complications. Complications of mumps may occur in the absence of parotitis. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of mumps should be suspected in patients with typical clinical manifestations (parotitis [or other salivary gland swelling], orchitis, or oophoritis) and relevant epidemiologic exposure (respiratory or household contact with an individual with known or suspected mumps). Individuals who are known to be unimmunized are at highest risk for infection, though mumps should also be suspected among vaccinated individuals with relevant symptoms and epidemiologic exposure. Patients being evaluated for mumps should be placed on droplet precautions. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the setting of parotitis (or other salivary gland swelling), the diagnosis may be established based on characteristic clinical features. Laboratory testing to confirm a diagnosis of mumps is warranted in the setting of extrasalivary gland involvement <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> in the setting of a possible mumps outbreak. Laboratory diagnosis of mumps virus infection may be achieved via serology, reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), or culture. At the initial clinical presentation, two diagnostic specimens should be collected: an acute-phase blood specimen and a buccal or oral swab.
