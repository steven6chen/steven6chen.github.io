When people have Barrett's esophagus, the normal cells in the lower part of their esophagus are replaced by a different type of cell.</p><p>Barrett's esophagus is usually caused by acid reflux. Acid reflux is when the acid that is normally in your stomach backs up into the esophagus. Many people with acid reflux never get Barrett's esophagus, but some do.</p><p>If you have had acid reflux for a long time, it's important to know if you also have Barrett's esophagus. That's because Barrett's esophagus can later turn into pre-cancer or cancer of the esophagus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29762318\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of Barrett's esophagus?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Barrett's esophagus does not cause any symptoms. But people usually have symptoms from their acid reflux, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Burning in the chest, known as heartburn</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Burning in the throat or an acid taste in the throat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomiting after eating</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble swallowing</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29762325\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for Barrett's esophagus?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor can do a test called an upper endoscopy to check for Barrett's esophagus. Your doctor might do this if you have had acid reflux for more than 5 years.</p><p>During an upper endoscopy, a doctor puts a thin tube with a camera and light on the end into your mouth and down into your esophagus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F75392\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75392 \">figure 2</a>). He or she will look at the lining of the esophagus and take a small sample of it. Another doctor will look at the cells under a microscope to see if you have Barrett's esophagus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29762332\"><span class=\"h1\">How is Barrett's esophagus treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Barrett's esophagus is treated by reducing or getting rid of a person's acid reflux. Treatment does not usually cure Barrett's esophagus, but it keeps it from getting worse.</p><p>Your doctor will likely give you medicines to stop your stomach from making acid. He or she might also recommend that you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid caffeine drinks, alcohol, chocolate, peppermint, and fatty foods. These foods can make acid reflux worse.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid eating before going to bed, eating large meals, or lying down after eating</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Raise the head of your bed by 6 to 8 inches (for example, by putting wood blocks under 2 legs of the bed)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29762339\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I follow up with my doctor?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you have Barrett's esophagus, you should follow up with your doctor. He or she will keep checking that your Barrett's esophagus does not turn into pre-cancer or cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29762346\"><span class=\"h1\">What if my Barrett's esophagus turns into pre-cancer or cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If this happens, your doctor will talk with you about different ways to treat it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29762353\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acid-reflux-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux disease) in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=upper-endoscopy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Upper endoscopy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=esophageal-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Esophageal cancer (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=barretts-esophagus-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Barrett's esophagus (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acid-reflux-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux disease) in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=upper-endoscopy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Upper endoscopy (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
