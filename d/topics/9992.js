Characteristic clinical features include livedoid skin changes (linear or angular, erythematous nodules), atrophie blanche (smooth, ivory-white plaques), and ulceration. The diagnosis is confirmed through a skin biopsy that demonstrates characteristic vascular abnormalities, including intraluminal thrombosis, endothelial proliferation, and subintimal hyaline degeneration.</p><p>The pathogenesis of livedoid vasculopathy is unclear. The disorder can occur either independently or in association with acquired or inherited thrombophilia or various systemic diseases. </p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of livedoid vasculopathy are reviewed here. Cutaneous vasculitis and other causes of leg ulcers are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cutaneous-small-vessel-vasculitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cutaneous small vessel vasculitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-differential-diagnosis-of-leg-ulcers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the differential diagnosis of leg ulcers&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NOMENCLATURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The literature on livedoid vasculopathy is highly problematic with regard to nomenclature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/livedoid-vasculopathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A variety of other terms have been used to refer to this condition, most often &quot;atrophie blanche&quot; and &quot;livedoid (or livedo) vasculitis.&quot; However, &quot;atrophie blanche&quot; is most appropriately used as a descriptive term for the smooth, ivory-white plaques that characteristically occur in livedoid vasculopathy but may also occur in other disorders, particularly venous insufficiency. The use of &quot;vasculitis&quot; should be avoided because true vasculitis, as demonstrated by destructive inflammation within the blood vessel wall, is absent. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2706739058\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> below.)</p><p>Less common terms that have been used to refer to livedoid vasculopathy in the literature include segmental hyalinizing vasculopathy, livedo reticularis with summer ulcerations, livedo reticularis with winter ulcerations, and <strong>p</strong>ainful <strong>p</strong>urpuric <strong>u</strong>lcers with <strong>r</strong>eticular <strong>p</strong>atterning on the <strong>l</strong>ower <strong>e</strong>xtremities (PURPLE).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2197963612\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Livedoid vasculopathy primarily occurs in young to middle-aged adults and is more common in females than males. The pathogenesis is not well understood but is postulated to involve increased coagulation or impaired fibrinolysis that results in occlusion of dermal blood vessels with fibrin thrombi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/livedoid-vasculopathy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Livedoid vasculopathy occurs on the lower leg (most common site), ankle, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dorsal foot [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/livedoid-vasculopathy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The presentation is often bilateral, but unilateral involvement may also occur. The characteristic clinical findings are livedoid changes and atrophie blanche. Ulceration is an additional common finding.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Livedoid changes</strong> &ndash; Livedoid changes are deep, barely palpable, slightly erythematous nodules that have a linear or angular shape. The appearance resembles patchy livedo reticularis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F113793\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113793 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Atrophie blanche</strong> &ndash; Atrophie blanche appears as smooth, ivory-white, atrophic plaques surrounded by hyperpigmentation and telangiectasias (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F82968%7ERHEUM%2F82969%7EDERM%2F113792\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82968 graphicRef82969 graphicRef113792 \">picture 2A-C</a>). The plaques often have small amounts of stippled pigment. Atrophie blanche can develop in sites of prior ulceration or in the absence of preceding ulcers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ulcers</strong> &ndash; Superficial ulcers are common and typically range from 1 to 5 mm in diameter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F113791%7ERHEUM%2F52615\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113791 graphicRef52615 \">picture 3A-B</a>). Larger and deeper ulcers may also occur. Removal of eschar will reveal a punched-out, angular, or stellate ulcer. </p><p/><p>Livedoid changes are often the initial clinical manifestation of livedoid vasculopathy. Alternatively, ankle edema or small, slightly raised papules with telangiectasias or purpura and peripheral petechiae may precede livedoid changes. Ulcers are often persistent; even with treatment, healing may take several months.</p><p>Most patients with livedoid vasculopathy experience substantial pain, burning, or itching in involved areas.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2706739058\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The characteristic pathologic changes occur in the blood vessels of the upper, middle, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lower dermis. The blood vessels demonstrate thickening and focal thrombosis, with endothelial proliferation and hyaline degeneration of the subintimal layer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/livedoid-vasculopathy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The hyaline material stains positively by the periodic acid-Schiff technique but is also visualized well on hematoxylin eosin staining (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F55773\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55773 \">picture 4</a>).</p><p>The elastic laminae of involved vessels are usually preserved, and the vascular wall is rarely destroyed. Vessel lumina are occluded by proliferating cells embedded within loose, fibrinoid material. The surrounding inflammatory reaction is relatively mild and consists primarily of lymphocytes. Extravasation of red blood cells may be present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSOCIATED DISORDERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Livedoid vasculopathy can occur with or without identifiable predisposing risk factors for thrombosis. Examples of risk factors for thrombosis that have been linked to livedoid vasculopathy include antiphospholipid antibodies, paraproteinemias, and genetic disorders that predispose to thrombosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-causes-of-venous-thrombosis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the causes of venous thrombosis&quot;, section on 'Inherited thrombophilia'</a>.)</p><p>Livedoid vasculopathy can also occur in the setting of a defined illness, particularly a systemic rheumatic disease. The diseases most commonly diagnosed in the setting of livedoid vasculopathy are the primary antiphospholipid syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, mixed connective tissue disease, and undifferentiated connective tissue disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/livedoid-vasculopathy/abstract/3,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of livedoid vasculopathy is confirmed through the detection of consistent histologic findings in a patient with suggestive physical findings (eg, livedoid changes, atrophie blanche, ulcers) on the lower extremities. The cutaneous manifestations alone are insufficient to confirm the diagnosis, as similar findings may occur in other disorders. Thus, a skin biopsy is mandatory. (See <a href=\"#H498849275\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>For patients with ulcers, a careful history and physical examination can be helpful for determining whether other diagnoses should be included in the differential diagnosis. The approach to the differential diagnosis of leg ulcers is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-differential-diagnosis-of-leg-ulcers#H477419\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the differential diagnosis of leg ulcers&quot;, section on 'Patient evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>The ideal biopsy type is a fusiform incisional biopsy that includes subcutaneous fat. Alternatively, a 4 to 6 mm punch biopsy can be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/livedoid-vasculopathy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The optimal site for a biopsy is the edge of a new ulcer or a new purpuric papule. The histologic findings in the dermal vasculature that strongly support a diagnosis of livedoid vasculopathy are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/livedoid-vasculopathy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intraluminal thrombosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endothelial proliferation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subintimal hyaline degeneration</p><p/><p>After the diagnosis has been confirmed histopathologically, an underlying disorder must be excluded. (See <a href=\"#H4243190975\" class=\"local\">'Additional evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H498849275\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of livedoid vasculopathy includes a broad array of conditions that may cause skin discoloration, cutaneous ulcers, or nodules of the lower extremities. The most common disorders in the differential diagnosis are lower extremity chronic venous disease, peripheral vascular disease, and vasculitis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chronic venous disease</strong> &ndash; Venous insufficiency involving the lower extremities often presents with cutaneous hyperpigmentation, edema, and varicosities on the lower extremities. Ulceration can occur and is most often found near the medial malleolus. Ulcers are typically shallow with irregular borders and yellow, fibrinous exudate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F104173\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef104173 \">picture 5</a>). Atrophie blanche may also occur. The diagnosis often can be made clinically; venous ultrasonography can be helpful when the diagnosis is uncertain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of lower extremity chronic venous disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Peripheral vascular disease</strong> &ndash; Peripheral vascular disease of the lower extremities can result in ischemic ulcers, which are often located on the toes, heel, malleoli, or shin. The painful ulcers are well demarcated, with a &quot;punched-out&quot; appearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F104174\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef104174 \">picture 6</a>). Peripheral pulses are diminished. The diagnosis is made through ankle-brachial index testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of lower extremity peripheral artery disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vasculitis</strong> &ndash; Vasculitis involving medium-sized cutaneous blood vessels (eg, cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody [ANCA]-associated vasculitis, mixed cryoglobulinemia, thromboangiitis obliterans, lymphocytic thrombophilic arteritis) may present with subcutaneous nodules, ulcers, livedo reticularis, or livedo racemosa. A skin biopsy can differentiate livedoid vasculopathy from vasculitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-adults-with-cutaneous-lesions-of-vasculitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of adults with cutaneous lesions of vasculitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Examples of other disorders in the differential diagnosis include pyoderma gangrenosum, factitial or traumatic skin injury, and the various additional causes of leg ulcers. An overview of the differential diagnosis of leg ulcers is provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pyoderma gangrenosum: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-differential-diagnosis-of-leg-ulcers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the differential diagnosis of leg ulcers&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4243190975\"><span class=\"h1\">ADDITIONAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After the diagnosis of livedoid vasculopathy has been confirmed histologically, patients should be evaluated for underlying disorders. The evaluation should begin with a complete history, review of systems, and physical examination to assess for findings suggestive of thrombophilia or a systemic rheumatic disease. Although we typically perform laboratory testing for thrombophilia in all patients, we limit laboratory investigation for systemic rheumatic diseases to patients who exhibit other findings suggestive of such diseases. </p><p>Examples of studies often included in our laboratory assessment include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests for acquired and inherited thrombophilia (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluating-adult-patients-with-established-venous-thromboembolism-for-acquired-and-inherited-risk-factors#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluating adult patients with established venous thromboembolism for acquired and inherited risk factors&quot;, section on 'Hypercoagulable tests'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete blood count</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Comprehensive metabolic panel</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinalysis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rheumatoid factor and antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptides</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum complement levels (eg, CH50, C3, and C4)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antinuclear antibody titer</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum cryoglobulins </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation</p><p/><p>The primary value in evaluating patients for a systemic rheumatic disease is the identification of patients at risk for other complications of the identified condition. Treatment of the underlying systemic rheumatic disease does not seem to have a consistent effect on livedoid vasculopathy, and the presence of a systemic rheumatic disease does not usually alter the approach to treatment. In contrast, the presence of thrombophilia influences our approach to treatment. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of livedoid vasculopathy usually involves a combination of interventions. No single therapeutic approach is effective for all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/livedoid-vasculopathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3198028558\"><span class=\"h2\">General measures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain management and wound care are important components of management. Smoking cessation and compression also may be beneficial.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pain management </strong>&ndash; Pain secondary to livedoid vasculopathy can be severe. Our first-line approach to pain management usually consists of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a>. Treatments typically used for neuropathic pain, such as tricyclic drugs, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>, may be useful for patients with recalcitrant ulcerations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/livedoid-vasculopathy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Wound care </strong>&ndash; Wound care should involve maintenance of a moist wound environment and control of superinfection. General principles of wound management are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-of-wound-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles of wound management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Smoking cessation </strong>&ndash; Although the effects of smoking cessation on livedoid vasculopathy have not been studied, we encourage patients to stop smoking because of the negative effects of smoking on wound healing. In addition, there is a proposed relationship between livedoid vasculopathy and smoking. In a series of 45 patients with livedoid vasculopathy evaluated at a tertiary care center in the United States, 47 percent reported a history of smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/livedoid-vasculopathy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Improvement may be related to a stimulatory effect of compression on fibrinolytic activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/livedoid-vasculopathy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Benefit from immunomodulatory, vasodilatory, and other interventions has also been reported.

Our approach is reviewed here. Other approaches may be reasonable.</p><p>The antiplatelet agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, a generally well-tolerated and widely available oral agent, is our preferred first-line therapy for patients without an identified thrombophilia. We typically prescribe aspirin alone for initial therapy, though combination therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dipyridamole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dipyridamole</a> is used by some clinicians. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentoxifylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pentoxifylline</a> is our favored initial treatment for patients who cannot tolerate aspirin. For patients who can tolerate aspirin but fail to improve on aspirin alone, we typically add pentoxifylline. </p><p>When patients have insufficient responses to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentoxifylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentoxifylline</a>, we often proceed to anticoagulation. We typically use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, low molecular weight (LMW) heparin, or a direct oral anticoagulant, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rivaroxaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rivaroxaban</a>. Most patients respond to one of these agents. For our rare patients with refractory disease, we have had some success with tissue thrombolytic therapy (tissue plasminogen activator).</p><p>Our approach to patients with identified thrombophilia differs. Anticoagulants are often used as first-line therapy; however, selection of an initial agent should be based upon knowledge of the therapies known to reduce thrombosis in the specific thrombophilia.</p><p>There is no fixed endpoint for therapy in patients who respond to treatment.

Long-term treatment with an effective regimen is usually necessary. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Livedoid vasculopathy is a chronic, recurrent, thrombo-occlusive vasculopathy of the distal lower extremities and feet that can lead to ulcer formation. Livedoid vasculopathy can occur independently or in the setting of a variety of thrombophilic states and underlying systemic disorders. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Associated disorders'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Characteristic clinical features of livedoid vasculopathy include livedoid changes, atrophie blanche (ivory-white plaques with peripheral hyperpigmentation and telangiectasias), painful ulcers, and edema. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A skin biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. The biopsy should include the full thickness of the dermis as well as subcutaneous fat. The optimal sites for biopsy are at the edge of a new ulceration or over a new purpuric papule. The histologic findings that strongly support a diagnosis of livedoid vasculopathy include intraluminal thrombosis, endothelial proliferation, and subintimal hyaline degeneration in dermal blood vessels. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2706739058\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Livedoid vasculopathy may occur in association with thrombophilia and systemic rheumatic diseases. Patients diagnosed with livedoid vasculopathy should be assessed for these conditions. (See <a href=\"#H4243190975\" class=\"local\">'Additional evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data on treatment options for livedoid vasculopathy are limited, and the best approach to treatment is unclear. Pain control and wound care are important components of management. Smoking cessation and compression may also be beneficial. (See <a href=\"#H3198028558\" class=\"local\">'General measures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Therapies reported as beneficial for livedoid vasculopathy have included antiplatelet, anticoagulant, fibrinolytic, immunomodulatory, and vasodilatory agents. For patients without an identified thrombophilia, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> as initial treatment based upon case reports and case series that suggest benefit as well as the tolerability, wide availability, and low cost of this therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentoxifylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pentoxifylline</a> is an alternative first-line treatment option that may be particularly useful for patients who cannot tolerate aspirin. Patients who do not respond to first-line treatments may benefit from other anticoagulants or other interventions. (See <a href=\"#H4262310548\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Selection of treatment for patients diagnosed with thrombophilia is based upon knowledge of the therapies known to reduce thrombosis in the specific thrombophilia.
