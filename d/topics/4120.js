The following parameters are important for ensuring accuracy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Collection tube</strong> &ndash; Samples for testing coagulation must be drawn into a tube containing an inhibitor of coagulation that can be removed at the start of the assay. A sodium citrate solution (3.2 percent sodium citrate) in a tube with a light blue top is most commonly used. The amount of citrate solution in the tube is fixed to provide an appropriate ratio of one part citrate solution to nine parts whole blood when the tube is properly filled. Patients with polycythemia require removal of some of the citrate due to a reduced plasma volume. (See <a href=\"#H17737815\" class=\"local\">'Sources of interference'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Blood volume</strong> &ndash; The tube must be filled with enough blood to provide an appropriate ratio of citrate to whole blood. Underfilled tubes can result in artificially prolonged coagulation times. Tubes should not be uncapped as it will result in an incorrect volume of blood being added [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-coagulation-tests/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Tubes must be filled to within 90 percent of the full collection volume. If the tube is underfilled it may lead to inaccurate results. Improperly filled tubes should be discarded and a new draw requested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-coagulation-tests/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mixing</strong> &ndash; Because blue top tubes contain a liquid sodium citrate solution, they should be inverted gently a few times as soon as possible after phlebotomy, in order to mix the citrate solution with the blood. The tube should not be shaken as this can cause hemolysis and may lead to inaccurate results.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Elapsed time</strong> <strong>and temperature</strong> &ndash; The sample should be tested in a timely manner to avoid degradation of the labile coagulation factors (especially factors V and VIII and protein S); substantial degradation of coagulation factors could lead to artificial prolongation of coagulation times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-coagulation-tests/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The total time between phlebotomy and testing should not exceed 24 hours. Primary coagulations tubes cannot be frozen prior to separation of plasma from cells.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17737815\"><span class=\"h2\">Sources of interference</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inaccurate results may occur if the following are present:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intravenous solutions</strong> &ndash; Ideally, coagulation specimens should be obtained by percutaneous phlebotomy. A discard tube is not required when drawing blood from percutaneous phlebotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-coagulation-tests/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. However, in intensive care unit settings coagulation testing is often obtained from indwelling catheters. The sample must be free of solutions delivered through indwelling intravenous lines, which may dilute the sample <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> introduce heparin. This is especially important for blood obtained from central venous catheters or ports, which are often flushed with heparin or citrate solutions that could lead to artificial prolongation of coagulation times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-coagulation-tests/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. When drawing samples from indwelling lines, the first few milliliters withdrawn are discarded, and the required sample is obtained from a second syringe or tube to avoid contamination with solution in the line.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anticoagulants</strong> &ndash; Good medical practice dictates awareness by the laboratory of anticoagulant therapy as this may greatly impact test interpretation and patient care. This may be done by the physician as part of the order entry procedure, by the laboratory personnel checking patient medications in the electronic medical record, or by contacting the ordering physician directly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other substances</strong> &ndash; Lipemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and hemolysis can all interfere with determination of clotting times. If it is not possible to avoid such an interference, dilution of the sample may allow an estimate of the clotting time. The need for sample dilution can be assessed by the laboratory at the time of testing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Polycythemia (eg, hematocrit &gt;55 percent) causes a corresponding reduction of plasma volume in the blood collection tube. Thus, patients with polycythemia require removal of some of the citrate solution to maintain the correct ratio of citrate to whole blood and to prevent artificial prolongation of coagulation times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-coagulation-tests/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. There are no corresponding recommendations for severe anemia. The best approach to such situations is to be aware of the potential interference and to contact the coagulation laboratory for guidance in proper collection if accurate clotting times are required for patient care.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1882137942\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF ASSAYS AND SPECIFIC TESTS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10463901\"><span class=\"h2\">Clotting times</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clotting times measure the time it takes plasma to clot when various substances are added. The citrate in the blue top collection tube chelates calcium in the collection tube so that coagulation is unable to proceed, because calcium is required for assembly of coagulation factor complexes on activated cell surfaces or phospholipids. Sufficient calcium to overcome the chelator is added back to the sample at the time of test initiation, along with a source of phospholipid and an initiator (tissue factor for the prothrombin time [PT]; silica or diatomaceous earth for the activated thromboplastin time [aPTT]). The precise composition of PT and aPTT reagents is proprietary and generally not disclosed. PT instrument reagent systems are standardized using the international normalized ratio (INR). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Prothrombin time (PT) and INR'</a> below.)</p><p>While the PT and aPTT provide an overall assessment of clot formation, they do not provide information about fibrin crosslinking or clot dissolution and will thus be insensitive to abnormalities of factor XIII function or abnormal fibrinolysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Prothrombin time (PT) and INR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prothrombin time (PT) measures the time it takes plasma to clot when exposed to tissue factor, which assesses the extrinsic and common pathways of coagulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F79998\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79998 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hemostasis#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hemostasis&quot;, section on 'Extrinsic pathway'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hemostasis#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hemostasis&quot;, section on 'Thrombin generation'</a>.)</p><p>The PT test is performed by recalcifying citrated patient plasma in the presence of tissue factor and phospholipid and determining the time it takes to form a fibrin clot. The formation of a fibrin clot is detected by visual, optical, or electromechanical methods. The result is measured in seconds and reported along with a control value <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an INR.</p><p>The normal range for the PT varies by laboratory and <span class=\"nowrap\">reagent/instrument</span> combination, and local institutional ranges should be used. In most laboratories, the normal range is approximately 11 to 13 seconds.</p><p>The INR is dimensionless. It is calculated as a ratio of the patient&rsquo;s PT to a control PT obtained using an international reference thromboplastin reagent developed by the World Health Organization (WHO), using the following formula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-coagulation-tests/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">INR &#160;= &#160;[Patient PT &divide; Control PT]<sup>ISI</sup></p></div></div><p/><p>The control value for the PT is the mean normal PT for the laboratory determined from &ge;30 fresh, normal plasmas handled identically to patient material. The ISI (international sensitivity index) is based on an international reference thromboplastin reagent; however, it is useful to have the ISI value confirmed within each laboratory for each PT reagent and instrument to account for effects of handling and equipment performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-coagulation-tests/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>Unlike the PT, the results of the INR will be similar on a blood sample tested in any laboratory using any thromboplastin <span class=\"nowrap\">reagent/instrument</span> system when calibrated correctly. This allows comparison of the patient&rsquo;s testing performed at different times <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> locations, which is a great benefit for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> monitoring (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-and-other-vkas-dosing-and-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Warfarin and other VKAs: Dosing and adverse effects&quot;</a>). Use of the INR is also extremely valuable for research studies because it allows investigators to compare the degree of anticoagulation of patients from different institutions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1473802\"><span class=\"h4\">Uses of the PT/INR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical uses of the PT include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation of unexplained bleeding &ndash; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-a-bleeding-diathesis#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult patient with a bleeding diathesis&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic approach'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosing disseminated intravascular coagulation &ndash; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation in adults&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obtaining a baseline value prior to initiating anticoagulation &ndash; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-and-lmw-heparin-dosing-and-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Heparin and LMW heparin: Dosing and adverse effects&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-and-other-vkas-dosing-and-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Warfarin and other VKAs: Dosing and adverse effects&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitoring <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> therapy &ndash; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-and-other-vkas-dosing-and-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Warfarin and other VKAs: Dosing and adverse effects&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment of liver synthetic function &ndash; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tests-of-the-livers-biosynthetic-capacity-eg-albumin-coagulation-factors-prothrombin-time\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tests of the liver's biosynthetic capacity (eg, albumin, coagulation factors, prothrombin time)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p>As noted above, the INR was developed to allow patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> at steady state to compare values obtained at different times and from different laboratories.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-and-other-vkas-dosing-and-adverse-effects#H633998\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Warfarin and other VKAs: Dosing and adverse effects&quot;, section on 'Monitoring (PT/INR)'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other anticoagulants</strong> &ndash; Heparins (unfractionated or low molecular weight) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fondaparinux-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fondaparinux</a> should in theory prolong the PT because they inhibit thrombin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> factor Xa. However, most PT reagents contain heparin-binding chemicals (eg, heparinase, polybrene) that block this effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-coagulation-tests/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, the PT may become elevated at heparin concentrations above 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/mL,</span> such as after a heparin bolus, due to saturation of the heparin binders. All of the available direct acting anticoagulants prolong the PT, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=argatroban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">argatroban</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabigatran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dabigatran</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rivaroxaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rivaroxaban</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apixaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">apixaban</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=edoxaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">edoxaban</a>. However, the degree of prolongation varies by the particular drug and the PT reagent used, and therefore the PT is not reliable for monitoring drug effect. All of the DOACs listed here are approved for use without monitoring except argatroban, which is a parenteral direct thrombin inhibitor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vitamin K deficiency</strong> &ndash; Potential causes include impaired nutrition, prolonged use of broad spectrum antibiotics, or fat malabsorption syndromes. When vitamin K deficiency is mild, only the PT may be prolonged due to a predominant effect on factor VII. However, in severe vitamin K deficiency, both the PT and aPTT may be prolonged. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-vitamin-k#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of vitamin K&quot;, section on 'Deficiency'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-lactam-antibiotics-mechanisms-of-action-and-resistance-and-adverse-effects#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Beta-lactam antibiotics: Mechanisms of action and resistance and adverse effects&quot;, section on 'Hematologic reactions'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Liver disease</strong> &ndash; Liver disease may be associated with decreased production of both vitamin K-dependent and vitamin K-independent clotting factors. When liver disease is mild, only the PT may be prolonged due to a predominant effect on factor VII. However, in severe <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chronic liver disease, both the PT and aPTT may be prolonged. Importantly, liver disease is also associated with decreased production of anticoagulant factors. Thus, a prolonged PT does not reflect the overall hemostatic picture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemostatic-abnormalities-in-patients-with-liver-disease#H61498865\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemostatic abnormalities in patients with liver disease&quot;, section on 'Effects of hepatic dysfunction'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>DIC</strong> &ndash; In disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), coagulation factors become consumed and depleted. This may result in prolonged PT and aPTT. Importantly, anticoagulant factors may also be depleted, and the PT does not reflect the overall hemostatic picture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Factor deficiency</strong> &ndash; Deficient activity of coagulation factors in the extrinsic pathway may be due to inherited disorders or acquired inhibitors (eg, autoantibodies). This includes deficiency of fibrinogen and factors II, V, VII, or X, or a combined deficiency involving one of these factors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rare-inherited-coagulation-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rare inherited coagulation disorders&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-inhibitors-of-coagulation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired inhibitors of coagulation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Antiphospholipid antibodies</strong> &ndash; Lupus anticoagulants with specificity for prothrombin (factor II) may cause hypoprothrombinemia and prolongation of the PT; occasionally patients with such antibodies and high antibody titers present with hypoprothrombinemia and bleeding. The combination of high antiprothrombin antibody titers and low prothrombin levels can result in false-negative lupus anticoagulant tests because of a prozone effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-coagulation-tests/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, isolated prolongation of the aPTT is more common. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Causes of prolonged aPTT'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>As noted above, polycythemia (hematocrit &gt;55 percent) can artificially prolong the PT if the amount of citrated anticoagulant solution in the collection tube is not appropriately decreased. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Sample collection and handling'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT, PTT) measures the time it takes plasma to clot when exposed to substances that activate the contact factors, which assesses the intrinsic and common pathways of coagulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F79998\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79998 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hemostasis#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hemostasis&quot;, section on 'Intrinsic or contact activation pathway'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hemostasis#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hemostasis&quot;, section on 'Thrombin generation'</a>.)</p><p>The aPTT test is performed by recalcifying citrated plasma in the presence of a thromboplastic material that does not have tissue factor activity (hence the term partial thromboplastin) and a negatively charged substance (eg, celite, kaolin [aluminum silicate], silica), which results in contact factor activation, thereby initiating coagulation via the intrinsic clotting pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-coagulation-tests/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The thromboplastic material provides a source of phospholipids.</p><p>The normal range for the aPTT varies by laboratory and <span class=\"nowrap\">reagent/instrument</span> combination, and local institutional ranges should be used. In most laboratories, the normal range is approximately 25 to 35 seconds.</p><p>There is no standardization of the aPTT test across different <span class=\"nowrap\">reagent/instrument</span> systems analogous to the INR for the PT. Thus, aPTT values from different laboratories cannot be compared directly. For heparin monitoring, it is recommended that each laboratory establish the therapeutic range by determining the aPTT range that corresponds to 0.2 to 0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> by protamine titration or 0.3 to 0.7 anti-factor Xa <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span>.

It is important to distinguish between factor VIII inhibitors and other inhibitors in the aPTT assay such as lupus anticoagulants because factor VIII inhibitors may be associated with life-threatening bleeding whereas lupus anticoagulants may be associated with thrombosis.

This is a functional assay performed by adding patient plasma to reagent factor Xa and measuring the activity of factor Xa using an artificial factor Xa substrate that releases a colored compound when cleaved (ie, chromogenic assay) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-coagulation-tests/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

For monitoring LMW heparin, anti-factor Xa activity should be tested four hours after the dose is administered. Oral direct anti-Xa drugs may also be monitored by anti-factor Xa activity in assays calibrated for the drug; however, there is no established range as these drugs were brought to market without a monitoring requirement.</p><p>Anti-factor Xa testing can be calibrated to estimate the specific level of other anticoagulants, and in such cases, the results of anti-factor Xa activity may be reported as an anticoagulant level (eg, heparin level). The activity of factor Xa is inversely proportional to the amount of the heparin or other factor Xa inhibitor in the plasma.</p><p>Results of anti-factor Xa assays may differ between centers due to variability in the type of assays used. Because of these differences, target anti-factor Xa levels may vary for different laboratories. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some centers use separate titration curves for unfractionated and low molecular weight (LMW) heparins, while other centers use a single hybrid curve. Depending on which is used, there may be slight differences in anti-factor Xa activity units reported from different centers. Using an anti-factor Xa assay to measure oral direct factor Xa inhibitor effect requires calibration for that drug to give accurate results.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of centers (80 to 90 percent) use assays without added antithrombin (AT). Rarely, a center may use an assay that adds exogenous AT to potentiate the effect of heparin. This can affect results of anti-Xa testing in patients with underlying AT deficiency.</p><p/><p>Other anticoagulants with anti-factor Xa activity besides unfractionated and LMW heparins include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fondaparinux-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fondaparinux</a>, which inhibits factor Xa indirectly (via antithrombin), and direct factor Xa inhibitors such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rivaroxaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rivaroxaban</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apixaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">apixaban</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=edoxaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">edoxaban</a>.

The most common inherited bleeding disorders presenting with this picture are von Willebrand disease (VWD), in which factor VIII levels may be reduced due to decreased stability of factor VIII; or isolated deficiencies of factors VIII (hemophilia A), factor IX (hemophilia B), or factor XI. Common acquired causes of this pattern are heparin therapy and the lupus anticoagulant phenomenon, caused by the presence of antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies. VWD and deficiencies or acquired inhibitors of factors VIII, IX, or XI can cause clinical bleeding, and aPL antibodies can cause thrombosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Isolated prolongation of the aPTT is also seen with deficiencies of factors XII, prekallikrein (PK), or high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK); in contrast to the deficiencies of factors VIII, IX, and XI, deficiencies of factors XII, PK, and HMWK are not associated with clinical bleeding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the patient has a known family history of VWD or a specific factor deficiency, it is appropriate to test for the disorder, as discussed in separate topic reviews.

Rarer causes include an acquired inhibitor of factor VII or a congenital factor VII deficiency. Warfarin use, chronic liver disease, and vitamin K deficiency are usually obvious from the medication list, patient history, and liver function testing. However, if these are not revealing, a mixing study and measurement of factor VII activity is appropriate.

Mixing studies are useful because they distinguish between an abnormally prolonged clotting time due to a factor deficiency versus a factor inhibitor. Inhibitors typically are autoantibodies that interfere with coagulation factor function in the patient (eg, acquired factor VIII inhibitor) or in the laboratory test (eg, lupus anticoagulant). Other interfering substances such as heparin can also act as inhibitors. Mixing studies can be performed for any of the standard coagulation tests, including the prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and thrombin time (TT).</p><p>Discussion with the consulting hematologist <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> laboratory personnel may be helpful to ensure that appropriate testing is done in a timely fashion.</p><p>Mixing studies are performed by measuring the clotting time of the patient&rsquo;s plasma diluted serially with normal plasma. The clotting time of a 1:1 mixture of patient plasma and normal plasma can be measured immediately upon incubation, and after incubation at body temperature (typically, two hours). The degree of &quot;correction&quot; of the coagulation time at both time points (immediately and after incubation) is reported.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1090045\"><span class=\"h3\">Clotting time corrects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following are the most common causes of abnormal clotting times that correct in a mixing study:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pure factor deficiency</strong> &ndash; Any pure factor deficiency will correct in a mixing study. This is because a 1:1 mix with normal plasma will provide at least 50 percent activity of any factor required for the test, which is more than sufficient to normalize the clotting time. If the 1:1 dilution corrects the abnormal test, the deficient factor(s) can be determined by individual clotting factor assays. The coagulation factor(s) evaluated depends on which clotting test is prolonged (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F79969\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79969 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1471052\" class=\"local\">'Coagulation factor assays'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Multiple factor deficiency</strong> &ndash; Certain conditions can cause deficiency of multiple coagulation factors. Examples include severe liver disease, vitamin K deficiency, and rare inherited coagulation disorders that affect more than one factor. Typically, these will be obvious from the patient history (or the family history in the latter case). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemostatic-abnormalities-in-patients-with-liver-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemostatic abnormalities in patients with liver disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-vitamin-k#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of vitamin K&quot;, section on 'Deficiency'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rare-inherited-coagulation-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rare inherited coagulation disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1090052\"><span class=\"h3\">Clotting time does not correct</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most factor inhibitors will not correct in a mixing study. This is because most antibodies will not be sufficiently diluted by an equal volume of normal plasma to result in correction of the clotting time. Importantly, however, some antibodies do not act immediately on their target coagulation factor. This delayed activity is characteristic of factor VIII inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-coagulation-tests/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In such cases, the mixing study will appear to correct at the early time point, but will not correct after one or two hours of incubation. The laboratory should report results from the immediate mix as well as after incubation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-inhibitors-of-coagulation#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired inhibitors of coagulation&quot;, section on 'Inhibitor screen (mixing test)'</a>.)</p><p>If the 1:1 dilution does not correct, the subsequent evaluation depends on the suspected cause of the inhibitor and the patient&rsquo;s clinical status. Early involvement of the consulting hematologist <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> appropriate laboratory personnel is advised as some of these conditions can cause potentially life-threatening bleeding (eg, acquired factor inhibitors), thrombosis (eg, antiphospholipid antibodies), or both (eg, disseminated intravascular coagulation [DIC]).</p><p>Common causes of coagulation inhibitors and their evaluations include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acquired coagulation factor inhibitor</strong> &ndash; Autoantibodies directed against factors VIII, IX, V, or X may prolong the PT <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> aPTT, depending on which factor is targeted. Importantly, some acquired factor inhibitors can be associated with potentially life-threatening bleeding. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-inhibitors-of-coagulation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired inhibitors of coagulation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Antiphospholipid antibodies</strong> &ndash; Antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies with a lupus anticoagulant effect most commonly prolong the aPTT. A lupus anticoagulant that affects the aPTT will not correct in a mixing study with normal plasma, but it will correct with excess phospholipid. If an aPL is suspected, the dilute Russell's viper venom time (dRVVT) or low phospholipid content PTT reagent (eg, PTT-LA) can be used to evaluate this possibility. (See <a href=\"#H690871\" class=\"local\">'dRVVT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>DIC</strong> &ndash; Fibrin degradation products may cause prolongation of the PT and aPTT, as may occur in patients with DIC or thromboembolism.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=factor-viii-and-factor-ix-inhibitors-in-patients-with-hemophilia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Factor VIII and factor IX inhibitors in patients with hemophilia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Heparin</strong> &ndash; Heparin in the blood sample prolongs the aPTT and TT but not the reptilase time (RT). Thus, the RT can be used to confirm a suspected diagnosis of heparin effect. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Reptilase time (RT)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>If an inhibitor is present, mixing studies can also be used to determine the titer of the inhibitor when appropriate. Serial dilutions of patient plasma are mixed with normal plasma until the proportion of patient plasma is reduced to the point that the mixing study does correct. The titer often is reported in Bethesda units (BU); the titer is equal to the reciprocal of the dilution of patient plasma that results in 50 percent factor activity. The titer correlates with the strength of the inhibitor (ie, the stronger the inhibitor, the higher the titer). Assessment of the titer is appropriate for patients who may receive factor replacement or may require other therapies for bleeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H311052\"><span class=\"h2\">Shortened PT and/or aPTT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Under most circumstances, shortening of the PT <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> aPTT reflects poor sample collection or preparation techniques. (See <a href=\"#H17738316\" class=\"local\">'Ensuring an accurate test result'</a> above.)</p><p>However, clotting factors may be increased or activated in vivo, as in malignancy, DIC, or following short-term exercise, resulting in shortening of clotting times, especially the aPTT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-coagulation-tests/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>A shortened clotting time that does not appear to reflect technical error has been associated with an increased risk of thrombosis, recurrent thrombosis, recurrent miscarriage, or bleeding, and may increase the risk of thrombosis associated with other common thrombotic risk factors (eg, factor V Leiden, obesity, increased levels of D-dimer) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-coagulation-tests/abstract/42-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-49</a>].
