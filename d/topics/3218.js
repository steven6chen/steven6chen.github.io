Atypical glandular cells (AGC) are found most commonly in women age 40 or older. As an example, AGC occurred more frequently in women ages 40 to 69 than in other age groups (1.1 to 2.4 versus 0 to 0.8 per 1000 women) in a study of over 75,000 cervical cytology specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cytology-evaluation-of-atypical-and-malignant-glandular-cells/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Histologic evaluation may identify normal findings or squamous or glandular lesions.</p><p>The distribution of histology and anatomic site was illustrated in the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two literature reviews that included approximately 4300 women with AGC (or atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance [AGUS] for specimens evaluated using the pre-2001 Bethesda classification) (see <a href=\"#H29161205\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cytology-evaluation-of-atypical-and-malignant-glandular-cells/abstract/9,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,17</a>].

In this study, AGC was classified by the Swedish Association for Clinical Cytology, and subcategories of AGC were not used. Follow-up of the AGC cytology specimen within six months showed the following prevalences and histologies of cervical cancer:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Squamous cervical carcinoma &ndash; 0.3 percent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cervical adenocarcinoma &ndash; 0.99 percent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">With long-term follow-up, the study found that women with AGC continued to be at a higher risk of cervical cancer than women with normal cytology for up to 15.5 years, with the highest risk being within 3.5 years, and then decreasing over time. Compared with women with normal index cytology, the risks were 24-fold at 0.5 to 3.5 years, 10-fold at 3.5 to 6.5 years, and 4.8-fold at 10.5 to 15.5 years. Women with AGC were at a higher risk of adenocarcinoma than squamous carcinoma. Interestingly, for up to 10.5 years, women with AGC were at a higher risk of developing cervical cancer (either adenocarcinoma or squamous) than women with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), and the risk became comparable from 10.5 to 15.5 years. A limitation is that the study followed patients forward from an index cytology result, but did not include information about subsequent cytology results.</p><p/><p>The lower rate of glandular compared with squamous cervical abnormalities diagnosed in women with AGC in the literature reviews may be secondary to the lower sensitivity of cervical cytology for detecting endocervical glandular dysplasia and malignancy than for detecting squamous malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cytology-evaluation-of-atypical-and-malignant-glandular-cells/abstract/9,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,17</a>]. This lower sensitivity has been attributed to several factors: it can be difficult for the cytopathologist to distinguish between high-grade squamous cells and glandular cells; endometrial cells, reactive endocervical cells, tubal metaplasia, and cervical endometriosis may mimic adenocarcinoma in situ; and lesions may not be seen or sampled because they are small or high in the endocervical canal. Another reason for underdiagnosis is the presence of minimal, poorly preserved endocervical cells, which are difficult to assess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cytology-evaluation-of-atypical-and-malignant-glandular-cells/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>AGC has also been associated with less frequent histologies, including adenosquamous cervical cancer and uterine carcinosarcoma (formerly referred to as malignant mixed M&uuml;llerian tumors) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cytology-evaluation-of-atypical-and-malignant-glandular-cells/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].</p><p>Rarely, further evaluation results in a diagnosis of disease at sites other than the cervix or uterus. AGC has been associated with ovarian, fallopian tube, or vaginal cancer, and some cases of colon or breast cancer have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cytology-evaluation-of-atypical-and-malignant-glandular-cells/abstract/17,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,23</a>]. Ovarian cancer has been reported in 0.1 to 0.6 percent of women with AGC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cytology-evaluation-of-atypical-and-malignant-glandular-cells/abstract/14,17,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,17,24</a>]. In addition, some women with AGC have benign cervical or endometrial findings (eg, endometrial polyps, tubal metaplasia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cytology-evaluation-of-atypical-and-malignant-glandular-cells/abstract/14,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H483200\"><span class=\"h2\">Modifying factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several patient characteristics and cytologic findings are predictive of the likely type and severity of abnormality associated with AGC.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H483365\"><span class=\"h3\">AGC subcategory</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several subcategories are used to further characterize a result of AGC on cervical cytology (eg, AGC-not otherwise specified [NOS]; AGC-endometrial), as noted above (see <a href=\"#H29161205\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above). The cytologic subcategory is somewhat predictive of the histologic diagnosis. As an example, in a study of 460 women with AGC, the most common lesions for each subcategory were: AGC-NOS (endometrial adenocarcinoma: 10.2 percent), AGC-endocervical (invasive cervical adenocarcinoma: 5.9 percent; adenocarcinoma in situ: 2.4 percent; and CIN 2,3: 5.3 percent), and AGC-endometrial (endometrial adenocarcinoma: 27.8 percent; and atypical complex endometrial hyperplasia: 22.2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cytology-evaluation-of-atypical-and-malignant-glandular-cells/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. A limitation of this study was that it combined AGC, favor neoplasia subcategories with other AGC categories (eg, AGC, favor neoplasia-endometrial was combined with AGC-endometrial), thus increasing the likelihood of malignancy in each subcategory.</p><p>There are few data about the histologic correlation of AGC classified as favor neoplasia. In one study (n = 138), high-grade CIN, adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), or invasive cervical or endometrial cancer was found more often in women with AGC, favor neoplasia compared with other women with AGC (56 versus 8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cytology-evaluation-of-atypical-and-malignant-glandular-cells/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6833383\"><span class=\"h3\">Coexisting squamous cytologic abnormality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately half of women with AGC have a coexisting squamous cytologic abnormality (atypical squamous cells or a squamous intraepithelial lesion), and these women appear to be more likely to have a squamous rather than a glandular lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cytology-evaluation-of-atypical-and-malignant-glandular-cells/abstract/9,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,26,27</a>]. As an example, in a study that included 353 women with AGC who underwent histologic evaluation, the proportion of squamous lesions was higher in those with AGC plus a squamous cytologic finding (squamous: 90 percent; glandular: 10 percent) compared with AGC alone (squamous: 72 percent; glandular: 28 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cytology-evaluation-of-atypical-and-malignant-glandular-cells/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8318502\"><span class=\"h3\">Human papillomavirus infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A positive test for human papillomavirus (HPV) types that are high risk for cervical cancer in women with AGC is associated with a histologic diagnosis of CIN, particularly those with AGC-NOS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cytology-evaluation-of-atypical-and-malignant-glandular-cells/abstract/28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-31</a>].
