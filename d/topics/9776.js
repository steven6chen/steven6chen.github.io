The high level of lead exposure required to cause lead nephropathy is now increasingly rare, particularly in developed countries, due to occupational controls and removal of lead from paint, gasoline, and other environmental sources (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F60319\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60319 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>However, prolonged lead exposure at the lower levels encountered in developed countries may still contribute to renal toxicity, an association that has been referred to as lead-related nephrotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lead-nephropathy-and-lead-related-nephrotoxicity/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This is most likely to occur in patients who have chronic kidney disease (CKD) or are at risk because of diabetes mellitus or hypertension.</p><p>The impact of chronic lead exposure on the kidney will be reviewed here. Other clinical manifestations of lead poisoning, as well as the evaluation and management of lead poisoning in adults and children, are discussed separately.

In addition, since lead accumulates in bone, the body lead burden from past exposures also contributes to current exposure.</p><p>Exposure sources are discussed in detail elsewhere.

The removal of lead from gasoline (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F60319\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60319 \">figure 1</a>) resulted in substantial reductions in lead exposure. Geometric mean blood lead levels in adults in the United States fell from 15.8 and 11 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (0.76 and 0.53 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> in men and women, respectively, in NHANES II [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lead-nephropathy-and-lead-related-nephrotoxicity/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] to 1.09 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (0.053 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> in NHANES data from 2011 and 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lead-nephropathy-and-lead-related-nephrotoxicity/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, levels remain substantially higher than preindustrial levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lead-nephropathy-and-lead-related-nephrotoxicity/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>] due in part to release from lead body stores and continued external exposure.</p><p>In comparison with blood lead, cortical bone lead reflects cumulative lead exposure and the potential for endogenous exposure since bone lead is mobilizable into the circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lead-nephropathy-and-lead-related-nephrotoxicity/abstract/2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8</a>]. Cortical bone lead is measured by x-ray fluorescence (XRF) in the mid-shaft of the tibia. The half-life is estimated to be 10 to 30 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lead-nephropathy-and-lead-related-nephrotoxicity/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Body burden from past environmental exposure can be substantial. For example, the average bone lead in chronically exposed lead workers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lead-nephropathy-and-lead-related-nephrotoxicity/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] was only twice that found in a study of Baltimore residents between 50 and 70 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lead-nephropathy-and-lead-related-nephrotoxicity/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Lead in trabecular bone (measured in the patella or calcaneus) is more bioavailable than lead in cortical bone and has a shorter half-life. As a result, it may be the best measure of lead dose that is both cumulative and bioavailable, although measurement precision is lower than cortical bone lead, which has been a limiting factor in the use of this measure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lead-nephropathy-and-lead-related-nephrotoxicity/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Chelatable lead is thought to represent a bioavailable pool of lead from blood, soft tissue, and bone. Diagnostic chelation, in which lead in urine is measured following administration of a chelating agent, can estimate the size of this pool. Removal of lead from these body stores is the therapeutic principle behind the clinical use of chelation as a component of therapy in selected patients with lead poisoning.

At this level of exposure, lead is generally the primary cause of renal pathology.</p><p>In addition to nephrotoxicity, lead exposure may be associated with both hypertension and increased cardiovascular risk. These issues are discussed elsewhere.

Signs of a Fanconi-type syndrome, such as glucosuria, aminoaciduria, and renal phosphate wasting, have been observed in patients (generally children) with acute, high-level lead poisoning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lead-nephropathy-and-lead-related-nephrotoxicity/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. These findings reflect diminished reabsorption due to proximal tubular injury and are associated with intranuclear inclusion bodies. The Fanconi syndrome generally resolves with treatment of lead poisoning, although glucosuria and aminoaciduria may persist for a prolonged period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lead-nephropathy-and-lead-related-nephrotoxicity/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Patients with lead nephropathy due to more prolonged exposure usually present with an elevated serum creatinine, little or no proteinuria, a relatively normal urine sediment, and hyperuricemia; a history of gout is frequently obtained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lead-nephropathy-and-lead-related-nephrotoxicity/abstract/13,15,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15,18</a>]. These manifestations are not specific, and lead nephropathy may be confused with chronic urate nephropathy, which, in the absence of tophaceous gout, is a relatively rare condition, or hypertensive nephrosclerosis.

In the absence of such indications, the data are limited concerning the renal benefits of therapeutic chelation in patients with lead nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lead-nephropathy-and-lead-related-nephrotoxicity/abstract/13,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,23,24</a>]. One study described the results of chelation therapy in eight lead workers with excessive body lead burdens, defined as urinary lead excretion &gt;1000 mcg (4.8 micromol) in the 24 hours after calcium EDTA chelation, and glomerular filtration rates (GFRs) &lt;90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lead-nephropathy-and-lead-related-nephrotoxicity/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Renal biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of chronic interstitial nephritis, consistent with lead nephropathy, and excluded other causes. The patients were treated with calcium EDTA three times weekly for 6 to 50 months; four had an increase in GFR of &ge;20 percent.</p><p>The mechanism of benefit from chelation therapy in patients with lead nephropathy is not well understood. Studies in rodent models of lead nephropathy found that the improvement in GFR was not associated with a similar degree of histologic improvement, particularly in regard to tubulointerstitial fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lead-nephropathy-and-lead-related-nephrotoxicity/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p>A potential adverse effect of chelation therapy is redistribution of lead into the central nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lead-nephropathy-and-lead-related-nephrotoxicity/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. Mobilization of lead from bone and subsequent excretion via the kidneys is also a potential concern; both are greater at the higher lead body burdens present in lead nephropathy than in the chelation studies discussed below.

However, published chelation experience in patients with renal insufficiency, particularly those with high lead body burdens, is limited.</p><p>Thus, in the absence of elevated blood lead levels and symptoms, the decision to chelate must be made on a case-by-case basis. Referral to a clinician with experience in lead toxicity and chelation is recommended. If chelation is indicated, patients with underlying renal insufficiency should have the dose adjusted for renal function.

However, it is important to note that lead exposure was not measured, but rather defined using an expert rating method based on job history. The patients with severe CKD from this study were then followed prospectively for a mean of 2.5 years.

In a model adjusted for age, sex, <span class=\"nowrap\">race/ethnicity,</span> urban versus rural residence, tobacco smoke exposure, obesity, household income, and education, a twofold higher blood lead level was associated with a 2.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> lower eGFR. Analyses using creatinine-based equations showed similar associations between blood lead and eGFR, although the associations were not significant. Notably, 99 percent of the study participants had blood lead levels &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span>.</p><p>An analysis in 391 participants in the Chronic Kidney Disease in Children (CKiD) prospective cohort study, whose mean blood lead and measured GFR were 1.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> and 44.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>, respectively, observed an association that was significant only among the 73 children with CKD due to glomerular disease. In this group, each 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> increase in blood lead level was associated with a -12.1 (95% CI -22.2 to -1.9) percent decrease in GFR.</p><p>Childhood lead poisoning is a risk for hypertension in adulthood. In a 50-year follow-up study, 21 adults with documented lead poisoning between 1930 and 1942 were compared with 21 control subjects matched for age, sex, race, and neighborhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lead-nephropathy-and-lead-related-nephrotoxicity/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Although blood lead and serum creatinine levels were low in both groups, the individuals with prior lead poisoning had a marked sevenfold increase in the risk of hypertension compared with controls (relative risk [RR] 7.0, 95% CI 1.2-42.3).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Chelation studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Further support for lead-induced nephrotoxicity as a risk factor for the progression of underlying CKD comes from trials of chelation therapy.

Although blood lead does not adequately assess lead body burden, other lead-dose assessment options (eg, bone lead by x-ray fluorescence [XRF]) are not readily available or commonly used in clinical practice.</p><p>Interpretation of the blood lead level requires an understanding of data from the general population. NHANES data from 2011 to 2012, well after the removal of lead from gasoline in the United States, revealed a geometric mean blood lead level of 1.09 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (0.053 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> in adults age &ge;20 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lead-nephropathy-and-lead-related-nephrotoxicity/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

One of these trials included 64 patients with nondiabetic, progressive CKD who had baseline serum creatinine concentration between 1.5 and 3.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (133 and 345 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L),</span> had 72-hour post-calcium EDTA lead excretion of 80 to 599 mcg (0.4 to 2.9 micromol), and had been observed for 24 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lead-nephropathy-and-lead-related-nephrotoxicity/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>The patients were randomly assigned to placebo infusions or weekly calcium EDTA chelation therapy (1 g) for three months, unless 72-hour post-calcium EDTA lead excretion fell below 60 mcg (0.29 micromol). Weekly chelation was repeated over the next two years if there were increases in serum creatinine in association with rebound increases in 72-hour post-calcium EDTA lead excretion. Baseline mean blood lead levels were approximately 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (0.29 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> in the treated and control groups. At 27 months, chelation therapy was associated with a slowing or reversal of the progressive decline in GFR compared with placebo (mean change of +2.1 versus -6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>).</p><p>A later randomized trial by the same group demonstrated a similar magnitude of benefit from chelation therapy in CKD patients with the lowest body lead burden studied to date (defined as 72-hour post-calcium EDTA lead excretion between 20 and 79 mcg [0.1 and 0.38 micromol]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lead-nephropathy-and-lead-related-nephrotoxicity/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that chelation therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dimercaptosuccinic-acid-succimer-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dimercaptosuccinic acid</a> (DMSA) had a beneficial effect on nephrosclerosis in a non-lead-exposed rat model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lead-nephropathy-and-lead-related-nephrotoxicity/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p/><p>However, important questions remain regarding the benefits of chelation in selected patients with CKD. As discussed above, there are potential concerns about the safety of chelation related to both redistribution of lead into the central nervous system and toxicity of the chelating agents (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above). Of particular relevance for the low-lead setting, cognitive impairment has been reported in non-lead-exposed control rats following chelation with succimer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lead-nephropathy-and-lead-related-nephrotoxicity/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

After more prolonged high-level exposure, patients present with an elevated serum creatinine, little or no proteinuria, and a relatively normal urine sediment.
