Normally, the kidneys work to filter the blood and remove waste and excess salt and water (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79864\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79864 \">figure 1</a>). Kidney failure, also called &quot;end-stage renal disease,&quot; is when the kidneys stop working completely.</p><p>With hemodialysis, a machine takes over the job of the kidneys. Blood is pumped from the body, filtered through a dialysis machine, and then returned to the body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F56992\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56992 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29652613\"><span class=\"h1\">Where will I have hemodialysis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people can choose between having hemodialysis at a dialysis center (in a hospital or clinic) or at home.</p><p>There are downsides and benefits to both options:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you have dialysis at a center, you will need to travel there and back. But doctors and nurses at the center can watch you closely during your dialysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you have dialysis at home, you or someone else will need to learn how to do it. You will also need special equipment and supplies. But people who do home dialysis often feel better and feel more independent and in control of their life. Also, some studies show that people who do home dialysis end up being healthier than those who get dialysis in a center.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29652620\"><span class=\"h1\">How often will I have hemodialysis and how long does it take?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You will have hemodialysis at least 3 times a week. Your schedule will depend on where you have it:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People who go to a center usually have dialysis 3 times a week. Each treatment usually takes 3 to 5 hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People do home dialysis 3 to 7 times a week, but they have more choice with their schedule. Some people do dialysis during the day. Each treatment usually takes 3 to 4 hours. Other people do dialysis overnight while they sleep.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29652627\"><span class=\"h1\">When will I start hemodialysis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You and your doctor will decide the right time for you to start hemodialysis. It will depend partly on how well your kidneys work, your symptoms, and your overall health. Your doctor will do blood tests to check how well your kidneys are working.</p><p>Before you start hemodialysis, you need surgery to prepare your body. Your doctor will create an &quot;access,&quot; which is a way for the blood to leave and return to your body (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparing-for-hemodialysis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: Preparing for hemodialysis (The Basics)&quot;</a>). There are 3 different types of access:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AV fistula &ndash; This is the most common type of access (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F71644\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71644 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AV graft (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F59794\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59794 \">figure 4</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central venous catheter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F69685\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69685 \">figure 5</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29652634\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens during hemodialysis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It depends on your access. If you have an AV fistula or AV graft, the doctor or nurse will put 2 needles into your arm, in your access. If you have a central venous catheter, he or she will connect the catheter tube to tubes from the dialysis machine.</p><p>During hemodialysis, blood leaves your body through the access. The blood travels through and is filtered by the dialysis machine. Then the blood returns to your body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29652641\"><span class=\"h1\">What problems can happen with hemodialysis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People can have problems with their access. An access can get infected, get blocked, or stop working.</p><p>People can also have problems during dialysis treatments. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling lightheaded</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belly or muscle cramps</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea or vomiting</p><p/><p>Let your doctor or nurse know if you have any problems. Many of them can be treated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29652648\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything else I should do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you get dialysis on a regular basis, you will need to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take care of your access &ndash; Wash your access with soap and warm water every day and before each dialysis treatment. Don't scratch or pick at the area. Don't let anyone use that arm to take blood or measure blood pressure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Check your access every day &ndash; When your access is working normally and blood is flowing through it, you can feel a vibration over the area. Let your doctor or nurse know if you don't feel a vibration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weigh yourself every day &ndash; When your kidneys don't work, fluid collects in your body. Let your doctor or nurse know if you gain more weight than usual between dialysis treatments.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follow a special diet &ndash; You will need to limit the amount of fluids you eat and drink. You might also need to avoid foods with a lot of sodium, potassium, and phosphorus. These are minerals that can build up in your body if you have kidney problems.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29652655\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I travel if I get dialysis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably. If you do home dialysis, you might be able to take your machine with you. If you get dialysis in a center, you will need to find a dialysis center in the place that you want to visit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29652662\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparing-for-hemodialysis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Preparing for hemodialysis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chronic kidney disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-between-dialysis-and-kidney-transplant-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Choosing between dialysis and kidney transplant (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dialysis-and-diet-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dialysis and diet (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-sodium-diet-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Low-sodium diet (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-potassium-diet-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Low-potassium diet (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-kidney-injury-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Acute kidney injury (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic kidney disease (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemodialysis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hemodialysis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dialysis-or-kidney-transplantation-which-is-right-for-me-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Dialysis or kidney transplantation &mdash; which is right for me?
