The procedure is centuries old and continues to be performed for a variety of religious, cultural, and medical reasons. Debate continues as to the utility of circumcision, The 2012 American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) policy statement regarding newborn circumcision states, preventive health benefits of elective circumcision of male newborns outweigh the risks of the procedure,&quot; but did not recommend it for all newborns, instead leaving the decision to each parent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-circumcision/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Despite this controversy, circumcision is the most common operation in the United States. A survey in 1992 showed 77 percent of US-born men to be circumcised and 42 percent of non-United States born men to be circumcised [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-circumcision/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Complications of circumcision and their management will be reviewed here. Circumcision technique and its risks and benefits are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=techniques-for-neonatal-circumcision\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Techniques for neonatal circumcision&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-circumcision-risks-and-benefits\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal circumcision: Risks and benefits&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Careful, meticulous attention to penile anatomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76391\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76391 \">figure 1</a>) and the correct use of surgical equipment by trained clinicians can prevent most complications from circumcision.</p><p>The rate of procedure-related complications during and after circumcision in the neonate is approximately 2 to 6 per 1000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-circumcision/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. This rate increases 20-fold for boys who are circumcised between one and nine years of age, and 10-fold for those circumcised after 10 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-circumcision/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Inadequate training of clinicians contributes to complications, as practitioners without formal training may not recognize congenital malformations (eg, congenital buried penis and penoscrotal webbing) that are more likely to result in poor results when using routine conventional methods (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F96246\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96246 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F96247\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96247 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-circumcision/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Patients with these abnormalities should be referred to a pediatric urologist.</p><p>Most of these problems are readily treatable and cause no long-term effects. However, when complications occur, especially surgical complications, specialist referral may be required for evaluation and reoperation.</p><p>The most common complications of male circumcision are bleeding and local infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-circumcision/abstract/3,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,8</a>], followed by unsatisfactory cosmetic results (too little or too much skin removed) and surgical trauma or injury. Rare but significant complications include life-threatening sepsis and meningitis, buried penis due to cicatrix formation, amputation of the glans, and necrotizing fasciitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-circumcision/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].</p><p>These points were supported by a large study that compared complication rates among 136,000 circumcised and uncircumcised male infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-circumcision/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The frequency of complications and genitourinary problems during the first month of life among circumcised neonates was 0.19 percent, a figure comparable to the 0.24 percent rate of urinary tract infections (UTI) in uncircumcised neonates. The benefit of circumcision in reducing UTI is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-circumcision-risks-and-benefits#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal circumcision: Risks and benefits&quot;, section on 'Reduction in urinary tract infection'</a>.)</p><p>The following circumcision complications were noted in the 100,157 circumcised patients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding &ndash; 83 cases (0.08 percent), including 31 patients who required ligature to stop the hemorrhage, and 3 requiring transfusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local infection &ndash; 62 cases (0.06 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical <span class=\"nowrap\">trauma/injury</span> &ndash; 25 cases (0.02 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinary tract infections &ndash; 20 cases (0.02 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bacteremia &ndash; 8 cases (less than 0.01 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MEDICAL COMPLICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bleeding is the most frequent complication following circumcision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-circumcision/abstract/3,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,11,12</a>]. It occurs from injury either to the frenular artery or dermal cut edges. The risk of severe bleeding is higher if there is an underlying coagulopathy. Therefore, neonatal petechiae or a family history of bleeding diathesis should prompt further evaluation before the procedure is undertaken. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-bleeding-and-perioperative-management-in-hemophilia-a-and-b\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of bleeding and perioperative management in hemophilia A and B&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There appears to be no difference in the risk of bleeding based on the technique chosen to perform the circumcision. This was illustrated in a randomized trial between Plastibell device circumcision and traditional sleeve technique circumcision that did not find any significant differences in hemorrhage rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-circumcision/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Some authors have reported that a worn Gomco clamp may predispose the infant to bleeding after circumcision due to inadequate crushing mechanisms. Therefore, the Gomco clamp should be carefully checked prior to each circumcision to ensure that there is no visible light between the bell and baseplate, and no stripped threads and screws [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-circumcision/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. There should be a minimum distance of 0.085 inches between the arm and the base plate prior to tightening. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=techniques-for-neonatal-circumcision#H96917995\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Techniques for neonatal circumcision&quot;, section on 'Techniques'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following is our approach to managing bleeding following circumcision:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first step to control minor bleeding is the application of firm manual pressure for 10 to 20 minutes, followed by compression dressing or carefully applied circumferential bandage. Caution should be used when applying any circumferential bandage, as penile ischemia or urinary retention can occur.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Manual compression is followed by topical application of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lidocaine</a> with 1:100,000 <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">epinephrine</a>, fibrin glue, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=silver-nitrate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">silver nitrate</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-circumcision/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In our practice, we prefer manual compression followed by an application of dressing. If this fails to stop the bleeding, the next step is the topical administration (1 cc on a moist sponge) of 1:100,000 lidocaine with epinephrine, which hopefully results in vasoconstriction of the offending blood vessel(s). If a specific bleeding vessel can be identified, then fibrin glue <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> silver nitrate can be directly applied.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If bleeding continues, fine absorbable sutures can be placed if a discrete source is visualized.</p><p/><p>Caution should be used with any of these hemostatic methods in the region over the urethra to prevent inadvertent injury to the urethra. If these maneuvers fail, then a pediatric urology consult should be requested, as formal operative exploration may be required.</p><p>Most commonly, bleeding after circumcision is a technical issue. If the described corrective measures are not effective, or the bleeding seems to be generalized, the patient should be evaluated for a coagulopathy. Evaluation that includes a complete blood count, including platelet count (prothrombin time), PTT (activated partial thromboplastin time), and fibrinogen level, will detect most of the major bleeding disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-bleeding-symptoms#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with bleeding symptoms&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic approach'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wound infection infrequently occurs after circumcision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-circumcision/abstract/3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8</a>]. It is usually mild and manifested by local inflammatory changes, which typically resolve with local topical triple antibiotic ointment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-circumcision/abstract/11,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,15</a>]. However, ulceration, suppuration, and systemic infection (eg, sepsis and meningitis) can occur and should be suspected in cases with systemic symptoms, such as fever, irritability, lethargy, or poor feeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-circumcision/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. These cases require systemic antibiotics and surgical debridement.</p><p>Although urinary tract infection (UTI) can occur in circumcised male infants, the frequency of UTI is significantly lower in circumcised infants compared with uncircumcised infants (0.02 versus 0.19 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-circumcision/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Thus, UTI is not a complication of circumcision, but rather a reduced risk of UTI is a benefit of circumcision.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical complications include the following, some of which may require reoperation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-circumcision/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urethral injuries</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glans injury</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Removal of excessive skin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inadequate skin removal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epidermal inclusion cyst</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal scarring, resulting in adhesions, cicatrix, or penile curvature</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anesthetic complications</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Urethral complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urethral injury can occur if too much upward traction is placed on the foreskin prior to clamp application, as it can cause entrapment of the glans in the clamp, possibly from incomplete separation of the glans from the inner prepuce. To prevent urethral injury, the coronal sulcus should be clearly delineated prior to commencement of the circumcision. Urethral complications include urethrocutaneous fistulas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50774\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50774 \">picture 3</a>) and urethral meatal stenosis.</p><p>If urethral injury is suspected, immediate pediatric urology consultation should be obtained. If the circumcision has not been completed at the time of injury, any prepuce should be left attached until the consultation, as this tissue may be useful in the repair of the urethra.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Urethrocutaneous fistulas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although urethrocutaneous fistula is most frequently associated with hypospadias correction, it may occur as a complication of circumcision (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50774\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50774 \">picture 3</a>). Fistula correction requires a second operation that is performed six months after the initial procedure. These repairs are generally cosmetically and functionally successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-circumcision/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypospadias-pathogenesis-diagnosis-and-evaluation#H4021400979\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypospadias: Pathogenesis, diagnosis, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Other uncommon variants'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Meatal stenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urethral meatal stenosis is almost always a condition of circumcised boys, and is rare in uncircumcised individuals. It is thought that stenosis develops from irritation of the newly exposed meatus, which usually occurs on the ventral lip [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-circumcision/abstract/11,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,15</a>].</p><p>Typical presentations occur after toilet training and include an upward deflected urine stream, inability to direct the stream into the toilet, or a small stream with prolonged voiding time. Often boys will push their penis between their legs to direct the upward pointed urinary stream into the toilet. Other less common presentations include episodes of gross hematuria, dysuria, and urinary infection.</p><p>A typical appearance is scarring on the ventral aspect of the meatus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F86959\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86959 \">picture 4</a>); however, visual inspection of the meatus alone does not make the diagnosis. These patients should seek an outpatient consultation with a pediatric urologist for further evaluation, including direct observation of voiding.</p><p>Treatment involves office or operating room meatotomy where a few millimeters of the ventral lip of the meatus are divided. Sutures are then usually used to reapproximate the cut edges.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Glans injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glans injury, including penile amputation, can occur if the glans is inadequately protected at the time the foreskin is excised, or if the glans is caught in the clamp apparatus when the foreskin is excised. These injuries have been described with Sheldon clamps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-circumcision/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>] and Mogen clamps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-circumcision/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Gomco clamps and Plastibell devices should theoretically protect the glans via the bell attachment; however, such injuries can still occur if the bell is ill-fitting or displaced, or if the incision is made at the incorrect location on the device.</p><p>If the glans is amputated, the tissue should be wrapped in saline-soaked gauze and placed indirectly on ice for transport. The patient should be transferred immediately to a referral center, as successful reattachment is possible if performed within eight hours of injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53520\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53520 \">picture 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-circumcision/abstract/15,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,19,20</a>].</p><p>If the glans is injured but still attached, immediate pediatric urology consultation should be obtained. In mild cases where urethra and corpora cavernosa are not injured, conservative management may be possible (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69887\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69887 \">picture 6</a>).</p><p>Another possible mechanism of glans injury can occur with necrosis of the glans secondary to ischemia from a slipped Plastibell device ring. The Plastibell ring should ordinarily sit over the glans for approximately one week until excess skin sloughs and the ring falls off (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F63926\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63926 \">figure 2</a>). If the ring is over-sized, it can slip proximal to the glans onto the penile shaft where it can cause constriction. If it cannot be removed easily, ring-cutters found in emergency departments can be employed to cut the Plastibell ring off.</p><p>The glans can also be injured when electrocautery is used. Thermal injuries can cause devastating, irreversible destruction that can leave the penis unsalvageable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-circumcision/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. For this reason, electrocautery should be used judiciously by experienced clinicians only or not at all.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Excessive skin removal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Too much penile shaft skin can be removed if upward traction on the prepuce is overly aggressive prior to excision, or if the glans is inadequately separated from the inner prepuce (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F96245\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96245 \">picture 7</a>). Excessive skin removal may result in a denuded penile shaft (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F86961\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86961 \">picture 8</a>).</p><p>In many cases, conservative therapy consisting of wet to dry or antibiotic ointment dressings results in adequate healing by secondary intention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-circumcision/abstract/11,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,15</a>].</p><p>More severe cases require pediatric urology referral for either primary reapproximation or skin grafting. If primary reapproximation is to be attempted, it is imperative that the length of skin prior to closure is adequate for function including erection. If adequate inner prepuce is left, this can be primarily sutured to the penile shaft skin to provide coverage. This method will leave the penis with the slightly altered appearance inherent with inner preputial skin. For cases with inadequate skin for reapproximation, split thickness and full thickness skin have been performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-circumcision/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Too little skin removed</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If insufficient foreskin is removed, the penis may not appear to be circumcised or the result may appear asymmetric (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F86960\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86960 \">picture 9</a>), leading to a displeasing cosmetic appearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-circumcision/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. These cases should be referred to a pediatric urologist for further consultation to determine the need for circumcision revision, which is not usually medically mandated. At that time, the risks of a reoperation, including anesthetic sequelae, need to be weighed against the benefits of improved cosmetic appearance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidermal inclusion cyst</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epidermal inclusion cyst occurs when an island of skin is left to heal underneath the skin of the penile shaft. Cysts usually are diagnosed by physical examination. Treatment consists of formal excision of the entire cyst.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Scarring complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Scarring complications after circumcision include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minor adhesions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dense adhesions referred to as skin bridges</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cicatrix formation</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Minor adhesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Minor adhesions are commonly found after circumcisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-circumcision/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], and consist of tiny areas of fusion between the foreskin and corona. These adhesions usually resolve with time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-circumcision/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Gentle retraction can be used to lyse the adhesion, followed by application of topical petroleum jelly or antibiotic ointment for one week to prevent new adhesions from developing. If gentle traction is not effective, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">betamethasone</a> 0.05 percent ointment or other steroid creams, which are used to treat adhesions in patients with phimosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-circumcision/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], may be tried but usually are not successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-circumcision/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Most minor adhesions can be prevented by instructing the parents to retract and clean any skin covering the glans, beginning a day or two after circumcision when acute bleeding is unlikely, and keratinization of the glans has begun.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Skin bridges</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>More complex fusion where the foreskin adheres higher up on the glans may result in dense adhesions, referred to as skin bridges (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66155\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66155 \">picture 10</a>).</p><p>Skin bridges can be visually displeasing and cause tethering of the penis. These boys should be referred to a pediatric urologist for possible lysis of adhesions via scalpel after the application of a topical anesthetic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-circumcision/abstract/11,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,15</a>]. This procedure may be performed in the office or in the operating room.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Cicatrix</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A cicatrix is a circumferential scar that usually develops at the incision line. It is commonly associated with a hidden penis, in which the scar prevents the penis from being exposed. Over time, this can result in trapping of urine, which causes more inflammation and worsening of the scar (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75225\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75225 \">picture 11</a>). In cases with a trapped penis by a cicatrix, outpatient referral to a pediatric urologist is necessary for assessment and intervention. Revision involves excision of the scar, often with skin flap coverage to substitute for a paucity of penile shaft skin. Adequate results can usually be achieved (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75225\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75225 \">picture 11</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-circumcision/abstract/15,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,27</a>]. One study has reported the use of topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">betamethasone</a> to successfully treat cicatrix without the need for surgery in 9 of 14 subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-circumcision/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Hidden penis due to a cicatrix needs to be distinguished from that commonly seen in overweight males with a large suprapubic fat pad. In overweight patients without any underlying pathology, the penis can be expressed simply by pushing under the pubic bone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71356\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71356 \">picture 12</a>). Circumcision in obese children or those with a relatively small phallus is generally discouraged during infancy because of the tendency for the penis to become buried [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-circumcision/abstract/11,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,29</a>]. If circumcision is performed, then care must be taken to ensure that the parents expose the penis once or twice a day with application of antibiotic ointment until healing resolves to prevent cicatrix development.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Anesthetic complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, most neonatal circumcisions are performed in the nursery and not in an operating room setting. In this setting, the most commonly used anesthetics include penile nerve blocks and topical anesthesia. These analgesic measures and their potential complications are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=techniques-for-neonatal-circumcision#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Techniques for neonatal circumcision&quot;, section on 'Pain control'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
