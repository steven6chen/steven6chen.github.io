Swallowed air usually comes back out as a burp.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eating certain foods, such as beans, broccoli, fruit, wheat, potatoes, corn, and noodles. Bacteria in the intestines digest parts of these foods and spit out gas.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble digesting certain foods, such as wheat or dairy products</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conditions that harm the digestive system</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H461564088\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes bloating?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The colon has a lot of bends in it (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F66110\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66110 \">figure 1</a>). When air gets trapped in these bends, you might feel cramps or sharp pains. This pain is common in the middle and top of the belly on either side.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H461564095\"><span class=\"h1\">How much gas is normal?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people pass gas 14 to 23 times each day. Burping before and after meals is also common. Gas bothers some people more than others.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H461564102\"><span class=\"h1\">Why does my gas smell?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most of the gas that comes out of your anus has no smell. But some of it contains a substance called sulfur. Sulfur smells bad to most people.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H461564109\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to get rid of gas and bloating?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You might feel better if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cut down on certain foods. Write down what you eat so you can figure out which foods are causing your gas. Everyone's body is different. Common causes of gas are:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Milk and dairy products</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Beans</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Some vegetables, such as cabbage, Brussels sprouts, asparagus, broccoli, potatoes, and corn</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Some whole grains, such as wheat</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Most types of fruit</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Artificial sweeteners</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Soda and other fizzy drinks</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Chewing gum</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take medicines that contain <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simethicone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">simethicone</a> (sample brand names: Maalox Anti-Gas, Mylanta Gas, Gas-X, or Phazyme). You can get these at a drug store. Simethicone breaks up gas bubbles in your intestines. Doctors aren't sure how well it works.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take a product called <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beano-alpha-galactosidase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Beano</a>. This can help your body digest beans and some vegetables.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take a medicine called <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bismuth-subsalicylate-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">bismuth subsalicylate</a> (brand name: Pepto-Bismol). This can help make gas smell less bad.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H461564116\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse if you also have any of these symptoms: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unexplained weight loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belly pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood in bowel movements</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of appetite</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unexplained fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Throwing up</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H461564123\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there tests I should have?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse will decide which tests you should have based on your age, other symptoms, and individual situation. There are lots of tests, but you might not need any.</p><p>Here are the most common tests doctors use to find the cause of gas and bloating:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests on a sample of your bowel movements to check for blood, unusual levels of fat, and other things</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood test to see if your body has trouble digesting an ingredient called gluten. Gluten is in bread, pasta, condiments, and other foods.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breath test to see if your body has trouble digesting dairy products or if you have an over-growth of bacteria in your intestines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>X-rays to see if there is something wrong with your intestines</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upper endoscopy or colonoscopy &ndash; For these tests, the doctor puts a thin tube into your stomach or colon. The tube has a camera attached to it, so the doctor can see inside you. The doctor can also take samples of tissue to look at under the microscope (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F52258\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52258 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H461564130\"><span class=\"h1\">How is gas and bloating treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on what is causing your gas and bloating. Treatments can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changing what you eat and drink</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changing how you eat and drink. Eating more slowly can help with burping.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using supplements to help you digest dairy products</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taking medicines that you can buy at a drug store</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taking medicines that your doctor prescribes</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H461564137\"><span class=\"h1\">Can gas be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can reduce your chances of getting gas again by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Staying away from foods and drinks that cause gas for you</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beano-alpha-galactosidase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Beano</a> when you eat beans and some vegetables</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taking supplements that help you digest dairy, if that is your problem</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eating more slowly</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H461564144\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stomach-ache-and-stomach-upset-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Stomach ache and stomach upset (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gas-and-bloating-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Gas and bloating (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
