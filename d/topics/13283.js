Many women with prolapse experience symptoms that impact daily activities, sexual function, and exercise. The presence of POP can have a detrimental impact on body image and sexuality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Treatment of POP requires significant healthcare resources; the annual cost of ambulatory care of pelvic floor disorders in the United States from 2005 to 2006 was almost $300 million [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] and surgical repair of prolapse was the most common inpatient procedure performed in women older than 70 years from 1979 to 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The health care impact of prolapse is likely to expand, based upon estimates of an increasing prevalence in the growing population of elderly women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>The epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and general principles of management are reviewed here.

The endopelvic fascial attachments, in particular condensations of the endopelvic fascia referred to as the uterosacral and cardinal ligaments, stabilize the pelvic organs in the correct position so that the pelvic muscles can provide optimal support (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57811\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57811 \">figure 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H690220\"><span class=\"h2\">Levels of pelvic organ support</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A system of three integrated levels of vaginal support has been described by DeLancey (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F61643\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61643 \">figure 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-management/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. </p><p>All levels of vaginal support are connected through a continuous endopelvic fascia support network:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Level 1 &ndash; <span class=\"nowrap\">Uterosacral/cardinal</span> ligament complex, which suspends the uterus and upper vagina to the sacrum and lateral pelvic side wall. Level 1 support represents vertical fibers of the paracolpium that are a continuation of the <span class=\"nowrap\">uterosacral/cardinal</span> ligament complex which inserts variably into the cervix and vagina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F61643\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61643 \">figure 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study of asymptomatic women, the uterosacral ligaments were found to originate on the cervix in 33 percent, cervix and vagina in 63 percent, and vagina alone in 4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

The pudendal nerve innervates the external anal sphincter, whereas the levators, coccygeus muscles, and urogenital diaphragm appear to be innervated by a direct connection of S2, S3, and S4 nerve fibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21524720\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The exact prevalence of POP is difficult to ascertain, for several reasons: (1) different classification systems have been used for diagnosis; (2) studies vary by whether the rate of prolapse reported is for women who are symptomatic or asymptomatic; and (3) it is unknown how many women with POP do not seek medical attention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-diagnostic-evaluation#H1120849\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic organ prolapse in women: Diagnostic evaluation&quot;, section on 'Classification of pelvic organ prolapse'</a>.)</p><p>The distinction between symptomatic and asymptomatic POP is clinically relevant, since treatment is generally indicated only for women with symptoms. However, there are few high quality data regarding the prevalence of symptomatic POP. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure#H10284328\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic organ prolapse in women: Choosing a primary surgical procedure&quot;, section on 'Women with symptomatic prolapse'</a>.)</p><p>In a cross-sectional study, the United States (US) National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 1961 women aged 20 to 80 years were interviewed. The authors defined symptomatic prolapse as a positive response to the question, &quot;do you experience bulging or something falling out you can see or feel in the vaginal area?&quot; and reported a 2.9 percent prevalence of symptomatic POP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The question used in this study was derived from the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory; a positive response correlates with the presence of a vaginal bulge on examination. However, the question has higher specificity than sensitivity for POP based on examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-management/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Population based surveys have found that 6 to 8 percent of women report symptoms of POP; no physical examination to assess prolapse was performed in these studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-management/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Prolapse estimates using only questionnaires underreport the true prevalence of prolapse based on clinical examination as surveys are likely to only identify women with advanced prolapse. </p><p>A higher prevalence of symptomatic POP is suggested by the number of women who undergo surgical prolapse repair. Approximately 200,000 surgical procedures for prolapse are performed annually in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-management/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Population based studies report an 11 to 19 percent lifetime risk in women undergoing surgery for prolapse or incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-management/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. These data likely underestimate the number of women with symptomatic POP, since many women do not undergo surgery.</p><p>Rates of asymptomatic POP are probably even higher. Several studies have used clinical examination to assess the prevalence of POP in a community-based setting. One study included 497 women who were seen in an outpatient clinic for routine gynecologic care and were assessed using the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantitation (POP-Q) system. The overall distribution of POP-Q system stages was as follows: stage 0, 6.4 percent; stage 1, 43.3 percent; stage 2, 47.7 percent; and stage 3, 2.6 percent. No subjects examined had POP-Q system stage 4 prolapse. The distribution of the POP-Q system stages in the population revealed a bell-shaped curve, with most subjects having stage 1 or 2 support. Few subjects had either stage 0 (excellent support) or stage 3 (moderate to severe pelvic support defects) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>In the Women&rsquo;s Health Initiative study, which used a non-validated physical examination to assess pelvic organ support in postmenopausal women, the overall rates for prolapse in this population were 41 percent for women with a uterus and 38 percent posthysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-management/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Anterior vaginal wall defects (33 to 34 percent) were significantly more common than posterior wall (18 percent) or apical defects (14 percent); it is important to note that the vagina is a continuous organ and defects in the apex contribute to anterior and posterior vaginal wall prolapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This study, however, did not assess women who had undergone previous surgeries other than hysterectomy and so women who have undergone prolapse surgery may have been included in this study population.</p><p>In another study of younger women, the total rate of prolapse on pelvic examination in women was 31 percent, with only 1.6 percent of women with prolapse to the hymen and none beyond the hymen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-management/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21524727\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Established risk factors for POP include parity, advancing age, and obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-management/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].

As an example, the Oxford Family Planning study, a prospective cohort study of more than 17,000 women followed for 17 years found that, compared with nulliparity, the risk of hospital admission for POP increased markedly after the first (fourfold) and second birth (eightfold), and then increased less rapidly for subsequent births (third: ninefold; fourth: 10-fold) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-management/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

As an example, one study of over 1000 women presenting for a routine gynecologic examination reported a progressive increase in the rate of prolapse with increasing age; every additional 10 years of age conferred an increased risk of prolapse of 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-management/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Similarly, in the larger Women's Health Initiative trial (over 27,000 women) there was a small, but statistically significant, progressive increase in the prevalence of rectocele with age (50 to 59 compared to 60 to 69 and 70 to 79 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-management/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

In a meta-analysis of 22 studies reporting the effect of weight on risk of prolapse, overweight and obese women had a nearly 40 and 50 percent increased risk of pelvic organ prolapse compared with normal-weight peers (risk ratio 1.36, 95% CI 1.20-1.53 and 1.47, 95% CI 1.35-1.59, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-management/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. </p><p>While weight gain is a risk factor for developing prolapse, it is controversial whether weight loss results in prolapse regression.

These women are managed conservatively. This condition may manifest initially during the pregnancy; however, in the majority of cases, prolapse is a preexisting condition. This is a rarely reported condition in the United States; the overall incidence of cervical prolapse in pregnancy has been estimated to be 1 case per 10,000 to 15,000 deliveries. Higher prevalence and more severe stages of POP in pregnancy have been reported in other countries with high childbirth rates. The management of POP in women with concomitant pregnancy should be individualized based on symptomatology and clinical findings. These women are managed conservatively with either pelvic floor exercises or pessary management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-management/abstract/100,101\" class=\"abstract_t\">100,101</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &ldquo;The Basics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beyond the Basics.&rdquo; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

Women with chronic constipation, those who have jobs that involve heavy lifting, and Latina and white women may also have an increased risk of POP. (See <a href=\"#H21524727\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common symptom of prolapse is a sensation of pelvic <span class=\"nowrap\">pressure/heaviness</span> or protrusion of tissue from the vagina. Patients frequently describe this as &ldquo;feeling a bulge&rdquo; or like something is &ldquo;falling out of the vagina.&rdquo; Women with prolapse commonly have other pelvic floor disorders, including urinary, bowel and sexual complaints (see <a href=\"#H21524755\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above). Women with symptomatic prolapse can be managed expectantly, or treated with conservative or surgical therapy. Treatment is generally not indicated for women with asymptomatic prolapse. (See <a href=\"#H7157266\" class=\"local\">'Approach to management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conservative treatment options for women with POP include vaginal pessaries and pelvic floor muscle exercises.
