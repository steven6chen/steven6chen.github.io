The normal sequence of activation is altered dramatically in RBBB, with a resultant characteristic appearance on the ECG manifest by a widened QRS complex and changes in the directional vectors of the R and S waves (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64393\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef64393 \">waveform 1</a>).

The right bundle branch is a long, thin, discrete structure that consists of fast response Purkinje fibers. The right bundle branch courses down the right side of interventricular septum near the endocardium in its upper third, deeper in the muscular portion of the septum in the middle third, and then again near the endocardium in its lower third. The right bundle branch does not divide throughout most of its course, but begins to ramify as it approaches the base of the right anterior papillary muscle with fascicles going to the septal and free walls of the right ventricle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14315874\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood supply</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The right bundle branch receives most of its blood supply from septal branches of the left anterior descending coronary artery, particularly in its initial course. In most patients, it also receives some collateral supply from either the right or circumflex coronary systems depending upon the dominance of the coronary system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70956\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70956 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14315790\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrophysiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The right bundle branch consists of a bundle of Purkinje cells covered by a dense sheath of connective tissue. Purkinje cells are specialized to conduct rapidly at 1 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/sec,</span> as phase 0 is dependent on the rapid inward sodium current (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64133\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64133 \">figure 3</a>). Initial activation occurs near the apex of the right ventricular endocardium, subsequently spreading to the septum and the free wall of the right ventricle, then moving much more slowly through the myocardial cells.

There was no significant association with risk factors for, or the presence of, ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular deaths, suggesting that RBBB is usually a marker of a slowly progressive degenerative disease that also affects the myocardium. Similar observations apply to left bundle branch block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/right-bundle-branch-block/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

This information is presented elsewhere.

The ST segment change is usually small, but, when present, it is discordant (ie, has an axis in the opposite direction) to the terminal mean QRS spatial vector. The T wave also tends to be discordant to the terminal conduction disturbance, resulting in inverted T waves in the right precordial leads (where there is a terminal R' wave) and upright T waves in the left precordial leads (where there is a terminal S wave).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H279462\"><span class=\"h2\">Other diagnostic considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several other diagnostic considerations in the ECG interpretation of RBBB:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RBBB does <strong>not</strong> interfere with the diagnosis of coexistent myocardial infarction on the basis of the usual Q and R wave criteria, since the vectorial forces of the initial 30 to 40 milliseconds are essentially normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/right-bundle-branch-block/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased right ventricular pressures may cause the initial vector to swing superiorly and posteriorly, which may produce q waves in the inferior and right precordial leads. This can occasionally simulate the changes seen with inferior and anterior myocardial infarction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a low sensitivity in the voltage criteria for left ventricular enlargement due to the late anterior forces and due to the reduction of amplitude of the S wave in the right precordial leads [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/right-bundle-branch-block/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14316219\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While RBBB has a fairly characteristic appearance on ECG, there are other conditions in which the ECG may have a similar appearance that need to be excluded prior to the diagnosis of RBBB.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H279419\"><span class=\"h2\">Incomplete RBBB</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Delay in the right bundle conduction ranges from trivial to severe, producing a similar spectrum displacement and duration of the rightward terminal conduction disturbance. RBBB is arbitrarily said to be &quot;complete&quot; when the QRS duration is 120 milliseconds or more, and &quot;incomplete&quot; when it is between 100 and 119 milliseconds. A RBBB pattern with a QRS duration less than 100 milliseconds may be a normal variant, presumably reflecting a slight delay in the terminal posterobasal forces in some individuals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H279315\"><span class=\"h2\">Ventricular tachycardia and accelerated idioventricular rhythm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the dominant ventricular rhythm originates from a pacemaker in the ventricle, the QRS will be widened and can have the appearance of a RBBB. However, both ventricular tachycardia (heart rate greater than 100 beats per minute) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63176\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef63176 \">waveform 3</a>) and accelerated idioventricular rhythm (heart rate between 60 and 100 beats per minute) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52385\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef52385 \">waveform 4</a>) are associated with atrioventricular (AV) dissociation, which should distinguish the rhythm from a supraventricular rhythm with aberrant conduction seen with RBBB. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sustained-monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-ventricular-arrhythmias#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: Ventricular arrhythmias&quot;, section on 'Accelerated idioventricular rhythm'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H279352\"><span class=\"h2\">Ventricular pacing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ventricular pacing from the right ventricular apex typically results in a QRS complex resembling that seen with left bundle branch block (LBBB) on the surface ECG. However, the QRS complex resulting from biventricular pacing is more complicated and may sometimes give the appearance of a RBBB (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64812\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef64812 \">waveform 5</a>). When a paced QRS complex has a RBBB morphology in the absence of an LV lead, the possibility of RV lead perforation or inadvertent LV lead placement must be considered. In nearly all patients, however, the presence of pacemaker spikes preceding the QRS complex differentiates a paced complex from a RBBB.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H279217\"><span class=\"h2\">Brugada syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Brugada syndrome is associated with particular ECG changes and an increased risk of sudden death. The ECG pattern of Brugada syndrome occurs in less than 0.2 percent of individuals overall but in as many as 3 to 24 percent of those presenting with idiopathic ventricular fibrillation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brugada-syndrome-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Brugada syndrome: Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The ECG in Brugada syndrome consists of a pseudo-RBBB pattern and ST-segment elevation in leads V1 to V3 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64510\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef64510 \">waveform 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/right-bundle-branch-block/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. The ST-segment elevation usually slopes downward, and the T wave is inverted. The widened S wave in left lateral leads that is characteristic of typical RBBB is absent in most patients with Brugada syndrome. This observation suggests that there is a high takeoff of the ST segment in the right precordium (ie, a &quot;J&quot; wave) rather than a true RBBB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/right-bundle-branch-block/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>In some patients, the ST segment abnormalities are transient but can be exposed by a sodium channel blocker, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flecainide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flecainide</a>, ajmaline, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procainamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procainamide</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/right-bundle-branch-block/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prognosis in patients with RBBB is related largely to the presence, type, and severity of underlying heart disease or associated conduction abnormalities:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with known or suspected cardiovascular disease (CVD), RBBB is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality. Several large cohort studies have shown an increase in mortality among patients with CVD and complete RBBB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/right-bundle-branch-block/abstract/9,26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,26-28</a>]. As an example, among 12,346 women with CVD (excluding those with LBBB) who participated in the Women's Health Initiative trial, there was a significantly greater risk of death from coronary heart disease (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.62, 95% CI 1.08-2.43) but not overall mortality (adjusted HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.84-1.44) among women with RBBB compared with no BBB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/right-bundle-branch-block/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The presence of RBBB after a myocardial infarction is also associated with an increase in mortality.

Several studies have demonstrated the association between RBBB and poorer outcomes after cardiac resynchronization therapy compared to those with LBBB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/right-bundle-branch-block/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>].

The right bundle branch is a long, thin, discrete structure that courses down the right side of interventricular septum, receiving most of its blood supply from the left anterior descending coronary artery, although in most patients, it also receives some collateral supply from either the right or circumflex coronary systems. (See <a href=\"#H14315697\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy and electrophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prevalence of RBBB, which appears to increase with age, has been estimated between 0.2 to 0.8 percent of the general population.

(See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Structural heart disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>RBBB can develop iatrogenically in patients undergoing right heart catheterization or ethanol ablation of the basal ventricular septum. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Iatrogenic RBBB'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The electrocardiographic features of the QRS complex which define RBBB in adults include QRS duration greater than or equal to 120 milliseconds, rsr&rsquo;, rsR&rsquo;, or rSR&rsquo; in leads V1 or V2, S wave of greater duration than R wave or greater than 40 milliseconds in leads I and V6, and normal R peak time in leads V5 and V6 but greater than 50 milliseconds in lead V1. Accompanying ST segment and T wave changes are due to an altered sequence of repolarization. (See <a href=\"#H14316065\" class=\"local\">'Electrocardiographic findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RBBB does <strong>not</strong> interfere with the diagnosis of coexistent myocardial infarction on the basis of the usual Q and R wave criteria, since the vectorial forces of the initial 30 to 40 milliseconds are essentially normal. (See <a href=\"#H279462\" class=\"local\">'Other diagnostic considerations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ventricular rhythms, ventricular pacing, and the Brugada syndrome, conditions in which the QRS complex has a similar morphology to RBBB, need to be excluded prior to making the diagnosis of RBBB. (See <a href=\"#H14316219\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prognosis in patients with RBBB is related largely to the type and severity of any concurrent underlying heart disease and to the possible presence of other conduction disturbances. Long-term outcomes are generally excellent in patients without apparent heart disease, while those with RBBB in the setting of underlying cardiac disease generally have worse outcomes than those without bundle branch block. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For asymptomatic patients with an isolated RBBB (complete or incomplete) and no other evidence of cardiac disease, no further diagnostic evaluation or specific therapy is required. However, permanent pacemaker insertion is indicated for patients with RBBB who develop symptomatic conduction system disturbances, such as third degree or type II second degree AV block that is not associated with a reversible or transient condition.
