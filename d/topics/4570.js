They are the cause of up to one-third of community-acquired upper respiratory tract infections in adults and probably also play a role in severe respiratory infections in both children and adults. In addition, it is possible that certain coronaviruses cause diarrhea in infants and children. Their role in central nervous system diseases, except for a single case report of encephalitis in a severely immunocompromised infant, has been suggested but not proven. (See <a href=\"#H1676302702\" class=\"local\">'Neurologic disease'</a> below.)</p><p>The microbiology, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of community-acquired coronaviruses will be discussed here. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: Virology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">VIROLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Coronaviruses are classified as a family within the Nidovirales order, viruses that replicate using a nested set of mRNAs (&quot;nido-&quot; for &quot;nest&quot;). The coronavirus subfamily is further classified into four genera: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta coronaviruses. The human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are in two of these genera: alpha coronaviruses (HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63) and beta coronaviruses (HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [MERS-CoV], and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [SARS-CoV]) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F101403\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101403 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Viral composition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Coronaviruses are medium-sized, enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses whose name derives from their characteristic crown-like appearance in electron micrographs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F62033\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62033 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. These viruses have the largest known viral RNA genomes, with a length of 27 to 32 kb. The host-derived membrane is studded with glycoprotein spikes and surrounds the genome, which is encased in a nucleocapsid that is helical in its relaxed form but assumes a roughly spherical shape in the virus particle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F53049\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53049 \">figure 2</a>). Replication of viral RNA occurs in the host cytoplasm by a unique mechanism in which RNA polymerase binds to a leader sequence and then detaches and reattaches at multiple locations, allowing for the production of a nested set of mRNA molecules with common 3' ends (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F74041\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74041 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p>The genome encodes four or five structural proteins, S, M, N, HE, and E. HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and the SARS coronavirus possess four genes that encode the S, M, N, and E proteins, respectively, whereas HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 also contain a fifth gene that encodes the HE protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The spike (S) protein projects through the viral envelope and forms the characteristic spikes in the coronavirus &quot;crown.&quot; It is heavily glycosylated, probably forms a homotrimer, and mediates receptor binding and fusion with the host cell membrane. The major antigens that stimulate neutralizing antibody, as well as important targets of cytotoxic lymphocytes, are on the S protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Receptor usage is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Viral serotypes'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The membrane (M) protein has a short N-terminal domain that projects on the external surface of the envelope and spans the envelope three times, leaving a long C terminus inside the envelope. The M protein plays an important role in viral assembly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The nucleocapsid protein (N) associates with the RNA genome to form the nucleocapsid. It may be involved in the regulation of viral RNA synthesis and may interact with M protein during virus budding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes recognizing portions of the N protein have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The hemagglutinin-esterase glycoprotein (HE) is found only in the betacoronaviruses, HCoV-OC43 and HKU1 (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Viral serotypes'</a> below). The hemagglutinin moiety binds to neuraminic acid on the host cell surface, possibly permitting initial adsorption of the virus to the membrane. The esterase cleaves acetyl groups from neuraminic acid. The HE genes of coronaviruses have sequence homology with influenza C HE glycoprotein and may reflect an early recombination between the two viruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The small envelope (E) protein leaves its C terminus inside the envelope and then either spans the envelope or bends around and projects its N terminus internally. Its function is not known, although in the SARS-CoV, the E protein along with M and N are required for proper assembly and release of the virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Viral serotypes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Coronaviruses are widespread among birds and mammals, with bats being host to the largest variety of genotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Animal and human coronaviruses fall into four distinct genera (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F101403\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101403 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. There are five non-SARS coronavirus serotypes that have been associated with disease in humans: HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and a novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV) that emerged in 2012.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The alphacoronavirus genus includes two human viruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63. HCoV-229E, like several animal alphacoronaviruses, utilizes aminopeptidase N (APN) as its major receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In contrast, HCoV-NL63, like the SARS-CoV (a betacoronavirus), uses angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Important animal alphacoronaviruses are transmissible gastroenteritis virus of pigs and feline infectious peritonitis virus. There are also several related bat coronaviruses among the alphacoronaviruses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two of the non-SARS human members of the betacoronavirus genus, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1, have hemagglutinin-esterase activity and probably utilize sialic acid residues as receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This genus also contains several bat viruses, MERS-CoV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>], and SARS-CoV, although the last two are genetically somewhat distant from HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F101403\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101403 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Important animal betacoronaviruses are mouse hepatitis virus, a laboratory model for both viral hepatitis and demyelinating central nervous system disease, and bovine coronavirus, a diarrhea-causing virus of cattle. Bovine coronavirus is so similar to HCoV-OC43 that the two viruses have been merged into a single species termed betacoronavirus 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The species is thought to have jumped from one animal host to the other as recently as 1900 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The gammacoronavirus genus contains primarily avian coronaviruses, the most prominent of which is infectious bronchitis virus of chickens. This is an important veterinary pathogen causing respiratory and reproductive tract disease in chickens.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The deltacoronavirus genus contains recently discovered avian coronaviruses found in several species of songbirds.</p><p/><p>None of the community-acquired human coronaviruses replicate easily in tissue culture, and, until recently, this impeded progress in their study. Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 were discovered in the 1960s and shown in volunteer experiments to produce common colds in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/3,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,20-22</a>]. Studies in the 1970s and 1980s linked them to as much as one-third of upper respiratory tract infections during winter outbreaks, 5 to 10 percent of overall colds in adults, and some proportion of lower respiratory illness in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>].</p><p>Little further information developed after this until the emergence of SARS in 2002 and the development of molecular diagnostic methods. Then HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 were quickly discovered and found to have worldwide distribution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>]. The polymerase chain reaction may be used for the diagnosis of each of the four human coronaviruses, and this technique has allowed substantial investigation into their epidemiology and pathogenicity. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Community-acquired coronaviruses are ubiquitous; wherever investigators have looked, they have been detected. In temperate climates, coronavirus respiratory infections occur primarily in the winter, although smaller peaks are sometimes seen in the fall or spring, and infections can occur at any time of the year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/24,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,30,31</a>]. The human coronavirus (HCoV) strains HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-HKU1 appear to predominate unpredictably in certain years and in certain parts of the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/25,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,31</a>]. HCoV-OC43 is probably the most common of the four strains, followed by HCoV-NL63, but the prevalence of the various strains in any particular year is unpredictable.</p><p>Respiratory coronaviruses probably spread in a fashion similar to rhinoviruses, via direct contact with infected secretions or large aerosol droplets. Immunity develops soon after infection but wanes gradually over time. Reinfection is common, presumably because of waning immunity but possibly because of antigenic variation within strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In hospital settings, spread among pediatric patients probably occurs through shedding by their infected caretakers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Outbreaks are common in long-term care facilities for older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>A large polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based study of viruses in adults and children with acute respiratory illness was performed in Scotland, with sampling in over 44,000 episodes over 9 years and gives some idea of the incidence of community-acquired HCoV infections in relation to other respiratory viruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. HCoV infections were most common in the winter, were distributed across all age groups, were less common than those caused by rhinovirus, influenza, or respiratory syncytial virus, but more common than other respiratory viruses; coinfections were relatively common, particularly in young children.</p><p>MERS and SARS are both zoonoses. Animals implicated in these infections are discussed in detail separately.

It is assumed that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have similar pathogenicity, but proof of this is lacking. Moreover, when tested by sensitive methods, asymptomatic individuals of all ages appear to periodically carry coronaviruses.</p><p>Human coronaviruses probably account for 5 to 10 percent of all acute upper respiratory tract infections in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], with outbreaks during which 25 to 35 percent of respiratory infections can be attributed to a single species. Like rhinoviruses, coronaviruses can be detected in middle ear effusions and have been implicated as important viral causes of acute otitis media in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, surveys that include asymptomatic children indicate that coronaviruses are often found in the absence of symptoms, suggesting that, although common, their pathogenicity in healthy infants and children may be low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-pathogenesis-of-rhinovirus-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and pathogenesis of rhinovirus infections&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-otitis-media-in-children-epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-complications#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute otitis media in children: Epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations, and complications&quot;, section on 'Viruses'</a>.)</p><p>Coronavirus infections have also been linked to more severe respiratory diseases. In adults with community-acquired pneumonia, coronaviruses are detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at frequencies similar to those of other respiratory viruses such as influenza virus, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus. Their etiologic role is not clear, in part because copathogens are often found. In two studies, simultaneous sampling of healthy adults was carried out: one found significantly more frequent coronavirus infection in those with pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], while in the other the numbers were small and the difference was not significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>The ratio of HCoV-OC43 outpatient infections to inpatient infections was threefold lower than that for HCoV-229E, suggesting that HCoV-OC43 may have greater clinical impact. Another survey of severe acute respiratory infections from 2010 to 2014 in Arizona in the United States found influenza virus most frequently (50 cases), followed by human metapneumovirus (25 cases), parainfluenza viruses (20 cases), coronaviruses (16 cases), and respiratory syncytial virus (11 cases); among coronaviruses, HCoV-OC43 predominated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Further information on the role of coronaviruses in acute respiratory illness in adults comes from a four-year cohort study comparing HCoV-229E with HCoV-OC43 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Among older adult patients, there is increasing evidence that coronaviruses are important causes of influenza-like illness, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, and pneumonia, where their frequency is below those of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus but similar to that of rhinoviruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/43-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-46</a>]. Several outbreaks of HCoV-OC43 respiratory disease in older adults living in long-term care facilities have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>], with case-fatality rates of 8 percent. A fatal case of acute respiratory distress syndrome in a 76-year-old woman with no underlying diseases and mono-infection with HCoV-NL63 has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>Coronaviruses have been found in 4 to 6 percent of adults with exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (less frequent than rhinoviruses and respiratory syncytial virus; equally frequent or somewhat less frequent than influenza; and more frequent than parainfluenza viruses, human metapneumovirus, and adenoviruses) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. They have been temporally linked to acute asthma attacks in both children and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-53</a>]. They have been found in variable proportions, ranging from 2 to 8 percent, of neonates, infants, and young children hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia, and have been identified even more frequently in lower respiratory tract disease in outpatients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/23,54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,54,55</a>]. They are also an important cause of nosocomial infections in neonatal intensive care units [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. One of the more recently discovered human coronaviruses, HCoV-NL63, has been associated with croup in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>].</p><p>Coronaviruses also probably cause pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts, including adults with HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/59-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-62</a>], hematopoietic cell transplant recipients, and patients with hematologic malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. There is some evidence of an association between coronavirus infection and acute rejection and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome in lung transplant recipients, although the association is less clear than for other respiratory viruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].

Early human studies depended on finding &quot;coronavirus-like particles&quot; (CVLPs) by electron microscopy in stool samples. The most convincing studies showed a strong association between the presence of CVLPs and diarrhea in infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>] or necrotizing enterocolitis in newborns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. In several studies, CVLPs have been purified that appear to be antigenically related to HCoV-OC43 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p>More recently, all four HCoV species have been found by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the stools of a small proportion of infants and children hospitalized with diarrhea (often with respiratory symptoms as well) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/30,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,67</a>]. Three surveys of diarrhea used molecular methods to screen for all four HCoV species known to cause community-acquired infections. In one study, all four species were found in stools from 2.5 percent of 878 children with diarrhea and 1.8 percent of 112 asymptomatic children by RT-PCR; however, in this and other surveys, most diarrhea-associated coronavirus-positive stools also contained other known pathogens, such as rotavirus or norovirus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68</a>]. In a study that used RT-PCR to investigate the frequency of coronaviruses in stool samples from children and adults with gastrointestinal illness, CoV-HKU1 was found in 4 of 479 patients (0.8 percent), and no other HCoV species were found [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p>Further adequately controlled studies using molecular methods are needed. Although it appears possible that coronaviruses are etiologically related to diarrhea, their role relative to other causes of diarrhea appears to be minor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">POSSIBLE DISEASE ASSOCIATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1676302702\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurologic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clear involvement of several animal coronaviruses in acute and chronic neurologic disease has stimulated a search for similar pathogenicity of human coronaviruses. Community-acquired human coronaviruses (HCoVs) can infect neural cells in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>], and three-week-old mice develop generalized encephalitis after intracerebral inoculation with HCoV-OC43 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. HCoV-OC43 RNA sequences have been detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of a 15-year-old boy with acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (ADEM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. In another report, full-length HCoV-OC43 RNA was recovered from the brain, with widespread cerebral immunohistochemical staining at autopsy, in an 11-month-old boy with severe combined immunodeficiency and acute encephalitis following umbilical cord blood transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p>With the observation that rats and mice infected with certain strains of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) developed a severe demyelinating encephalitis similar to multiple sclerosis (MS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>], investigators have sought to link coronaviruses with MS. Currently available evidence is inconclusive. T cell clones from patients with MS have been shown to react both with HCoV-229E antigens and myelin basic protein, suggesting molecular mimicry as a basis of pathogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Some, but not all, investigators have detected RNA of the human coronaviruses, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E, more frequently in brain tissue from MS patients by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction than in healthy individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p>Despite these findings, an etiologic connection between coronaviruses and MS or other demyelinating diseases remains tentative and unproven.

Others failed to confirm this finding, and, at the present time, it is assumed that known coronaviruses have no role in this disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/78,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,79</a>].

In contrast, diagnosing Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is critically important for understanding outbreak epidemiology and limiting transmission of infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H2707356371\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Until recently, no sensitive, rapid method existed to detect all of the known human coronavirus strains. Rapid techniques that can be used to detect coronaviruses from nasopharyngeal samples include reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunofluorescence antigen detection assays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/80-82\" class=\"abstract_t\">80-82</a>].</p><p>Because of its utility for detecting all four of the known human coronavirus strains to cause community-acquired infections, RT-PCR has supplanted other diagnostic methods. Although broadly reacting pan-coronavirus primers have been developed, they are less sensitive than primers designed for each of the four human strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/80,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,83</a>]. The sensitivity may be further improved by using real-time RT-PCR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

Several antivirals and other agents were used during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak, but the efficacy of these drugs has not been established.

First, four separate species have been described and there is evidence within at least one of these species of clinically significant antigenic variation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In addition, vaccine enhancement of disease has been shown for one animal coronavirus, feline coronavirus; hypersensitivity was induced in some animals by prior exposure to a vaccine containing the S protein, with the production of an immunologically mediated severe disease, feline infectious peritonitis, upon reinfection with a coronavirus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. There has been interest in the development of a SARS-CoV vaccine and a MERS-CoV vaccine.
