In a retrospective cohort study of patients treated over a four-year period at a specialty referral facility offering hyperbaric oxygen treatment, 61 patients treated for carbon monoxide poisoning had a history of exposure to waterpipe smoking. The most common symptoms were syncope, dizziness, headache, and nausea. Clinicians should be alert to this risk and warn patients of this potential consequence of waterpipe use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-pediatrics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Human rhinovirus was most commonly detected. This study supports limiting diagnostic testing for bacterial illness in well-appearing febrile infants 29 to 90 days of age when highly accurate rapid viral testing is positive. However, a full sepsis evaluation is still indicated in neonates, regardless of the results of respiratory virus testing. Highly accurate testing for bronchiolitis and influenza is widely available, while panels for other viral pathogens (eg, human rhinovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> human metapneumovirus) are not always readily available and may be cost-prohibitive.

When UTI is defined as &gt;50,000 colony-forming units on urine culture, this study found that urinalysis has high diagnostic accuracy in febrile young infants.

In January 2018, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) systematic review confirmed that screening is sufficiently sensitive to detect AIS, and bracing may slow curve progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-pediatrics/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, evidence regarding the benefits of other interventions (eg, exercise, surgery), harms of screening, and long-term (adult) outcomes was inadequate, leading to an overall conclusion that evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-pediatrics/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

A large retrospective study compared the risk of a mental health diagnosis or developmental delay for children in 11 separate age cohorts (from &lt;28 weeks to 5 years) undergoing minor common surgical procedures with matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-pediatrics/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Although there was an increased risk for a mental health disorder or developmental delay in children with anesthesia exposure (hazard ratios 1.26 to 1.31), there was no difference in risk between the different age cohorts. There is little support for delaying necessary minor surgery in young children to reduce neurodevelopmental risks.

Added to the risk related to chemical constituents produced during use of an ENDS, there is a risk of burns due to device malfunction. Burns to local tissue have occurred while an ENDS device was stored (eg, in a pants pocket) or during its use, resulting in burns to the thigh, groin, face, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-pediatrics/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Excess prescription has been well documented in adults, but there have been no data on opioid requirements or prescribing practices for pediatric patients. A prospective study of 343 children who were discharged from the hospital with an opioid prescription reported that 58 percent of prescribed doses were not consumed, and only 4 percent of leftover medication was disposed of [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-pediatrics/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Female sex, orthopedic or Nuss procedures, and discharge pain scores <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;5/10</span> predicted higher opioid consumption.

A study analyzed primary care health records from England from 2001 to 2014 and matched over 8,000 children and adolescents (aged 10 to 19 years) who had an episode of self-harm with a cohort of children and adolescents without self-harm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-pediatrics/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Compared with the control group, children and adolescents who harmed themselves were three times more likely to eventually die from natural causes and nine times more likely to die from unnatural causes, including suicide, or alcohol and drug poisoning. Thus, children and adolescents should receive treatment for any episode of self-harm.

In a new meta-analysis of individual-level data from case-control studies, any breastfeeding for at least two months nearly halved the risk for SIDS, after controlling for potential confounders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-pediatrics/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Protection against SIDS increased with longer duration of breastfeeding, but not with exclusive breastfeeding compared with partial breastfeeding.

A large systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies among individuals aged 14 to 30 years showed that, compared with e-cigarette never-users, ever-users had a higher probability of initiating cigarette smoking (31 versus 8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-pediatrics/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. These studies do not distinguish if e-cigarette use increases the desire to smoke conventional cigarettes or whether e-cigarette users have a predisposition to smoke. Nonetheless, the finding of a greater likelihood of future conventional smoking among younger e-cigarette users is useful information for clinicians when educating patients about risks of tobacco use.

They continue to recommend the management and monitoring of transgender adolescents and adult men and women by a multidisciplinary team, as well as counseling patients about the time course of hormone-induced physical changes and options for fertility preservation.

The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported an approximately 18 percent increase in the rate of primary and secondary syphilis (the most infectious stages of the disease) in 2016, with 8.7 cases per 100,000 population, the highest rate since 1993 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-pediatrics/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. More than 600 cases of congenital syphilis were also reported. Although syphilis rates increased among men and women, the rise was primarily attributable to men who have sex with men (MSM). These findings stress the importance of screening and treatment for sexually transmitted infection, especially in MSM and pregnant women.

Children participating in contact sports are more likely to report having had a concussion (32 percent) compared with those reporting noncontact sports participation (18 percent) or no sports participation (11 percent). Participation in contact sports was also associated with reporting more than one concussion. These findings, consistent with other evidence, indicate that concussion is a common injury that occurs most frequently in adolescent athletes who participate in contact sports such as American football, ice hockey, rugby, or soccer.

In a case-control study of nearly 3000 men whose cognitive function was assessed at age 65 years, past participation in high school American football was not associated with worse cognition, mood, or other emotional symptoms compared with non-participation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-pediatrics/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Although somewhat reassuring, these data have significant limitations, and more longitudinal studies are needed to determine modifiable risk factors for CTE and other forms of dementia.

In an earlier study, a single dose of secnidazole was as effective as, but not superior to, metronidazole for seven days. Secnidazole is an option for BV when a single dose is desired (eg, to enhance adherence), but it is more expensive than other regimens.

In a series of 40 children with narcolepsy type 1 who underwent video polysomnography, nearly one-third of patients exhibited motor behaviors during REM sleep ranging from classic dream enactment (eg, vigorous reaching or throwing movements) to more calm, slow pantomime-like events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-pediatrics/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Events were more common among children with impaired nighttime sleep, worse daytime sleepiness, and severe cataplexy.

Based on the review, the FDA removed the &quot;boxed warning&quot; on combination LABA-inhaled glucocorticoid medications. The FDA continues to warn that monotherapy with a LABA (ie, without the concomitant use of an inhaled glucocorticoid) is contraindicated in the treatment of asthma.

However, HSATs are not recommended for diagnosis of OSA in children, as explained in a position paper from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-pediatrics/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. The main concerns are that HSATs may underestimate OSA presence and severity in children and technical challenges of obtaining adequate data in this population.

The approval for F508del homozygotes was based upon a randomized trial that reported modest improvement in pulmonary function and lower risk of pulmonary exacerbations over the duration of the trial, and a good safety profile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-pediatrics/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].
