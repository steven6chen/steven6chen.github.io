Together with the treating clinician, the patient and family must evaluate the risks and benefits of the various treatment options to determine the optimal treatment strategy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-overview-of-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H483677\"><span class=\"h2\">Target goals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of children with ADHD centers upon the achievement of target outcomes that are realistic, achievable, and measurable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-overview-of-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

In a randomized trial, families of 244 children (5 to 12 years of age) with ADHD and parent-reported moderate to severe sleep problems who met diagnostic criteria for at least one sleep disorder (eg, delayed sleep phase, limit setting disorder) were assigned to receive a brief behavioral sleep intervention or usual care; 88 percent of children in both groups were receiving pharmacotherapy (predominantly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methylphenidate</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-overview-of-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The intervention consisted of two consultations about sleep with a trained clinician two weeks apart and a follow-up phone call two weeks later.

Dietary factors (eg, food additives, food allergy or intolerance, etc) generally do not impact behavior to a clinically significant level and do not account for the majority of cases of ADHD.

Indications for referral to or consultation with a specialist (eg, developmental behavioral pediatrician, child neurologist, psychopharmacologist, child psychiatrist, clinical child psychologist) may include (see <a href=\"#H2162173\" class=\"local\">'Indications for referral'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Coexisting psychiatric conditions (eg, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, substance abuse, emotional problems)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Coexisting neurologic, or medical conditions (eg, seizures, tics, autism spectrum disorder, sleep disorder)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lack of response to a controlled trial of stimulant therapy or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atomoxetine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">atomoxetine</a></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For preschool children (age 4 through 5 years) who meet the diagnostic criteria for ADHD, we recommend behavior therapy rather than medication as the initial therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). The addition of medication to behavior therapy may be indicated if target behaviors do not improve with behavioral therapy and the child's function continues to be impaired. When medication is necessary for preschool children, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methylphenidate</a> rather than amphetamines or nonstimulants (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H830607507\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"#H483772\" class=\"local\">'Preschool children'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-treatment-with-medications#H2007898714\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: Treatment with medications&quot;, section on 'Preschool children'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most school-aged children (&ge;6 years) and adolescents with ADHD who meet specific criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66213\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66213 \">table 3</a>), we suggest treatment with medication rather than behavior therapy alone or no intervention (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=4\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2A</a>). However, decisions regarding the choice of therapy should involve the patient and his or her parents. When the decision is made to try medications, we suggest a stimulant as the first line agent (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H483779\" class=\"local\">'School-age children'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacotherapy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-treatment-with-medications#H2007898686\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: Treatment with medications&quot;, section on 'Choice of agent'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For school-aged children (&ge;6 years) and adolescents with ADHD, we suggest that behavioral interventions be added to medication therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Adding <span class=\"nowrap\">behavioral/psychologic</span> therapy to stimulant therapy in school-aged children and adolescents does not provide additional benefit for core symptoms of ADHD, but may affect symptoms of coexisting conditions (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">oppositional/aggressive</span> behavior) and lower the dose of stimulant therapy necessary to achieve the desired effects. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Combination therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children being treated for ADHD should be monitored regularly for adherence to the treatment plan, achievement of target goals, occurrence of core symptoms, and adverse effects of therapy. The frequency of follow-up depends upon the management strategy. (See <a href=\"#H130704242\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with ADHD may require changes in their educational programming, including tutoring, resource room support, or special classes (eg, inclusion classes, blended classes). (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'School-based interventions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest not using elimination diets for most children with ADHD (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, a short trial (no more than five weeks) of an elimination diet may be an option for children with ADHD whose caregivers are concerned about the use and potential side effects of pharmacologic agents and are motivated to comply with the diet. (See <a href=\"#H450433671\" class=\"local\">'Elimination diets'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest not using essential fatty acid supplementation for children with ADHD (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H450433678\" class=\"local\">'Essential fatty acid supplementation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children and adolescents with ADHD have an increased risk of substance use, particularly those with comorbid oppositional defiant disorder, or conduct disorder; and intentional and unintentional injuries; those who drive have an increased risk of motor vehicle accidents.
