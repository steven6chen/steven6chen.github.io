The defect is often asymptomatic until adulthood, with potential presenting complications of atrial arrhythmias and paradoxical embolization. Late complications of larger defects include right ventricular dilatation, tricuspid regurgitation, right heart failure and pulmonary hypertension that can become irreversible and lead to right-to-left shunting (Eisenmenger syndrome). </p><p>The pathophysiology, anatomy, natural history, and clinical features of ASDs in adults will be reviewed here. The identification and assessment of ASDs, methods for treatment, and issues related to ASDs in children are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=identification-and-assessment-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Identification and assessment of atrial septal defects in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-for-closure-and-medical-management-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications for closure and medical management of atrial septal defects in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-atrial-septal-defects-asds-and-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-isolated-asds-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of atrial septal defects (ASDs), and clinical features and diagnosis of isolated ASDs in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-outcome-of-isolated-atrial-septal-defects-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and outcome of isolated atrial septal defects in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H256131897\"><span class=\"h1\">EMBRYOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atrial septation begins as early as the fifth week of gestation. The septum primum arises from the superior portion of the common atrium and grows caudally to the endocardial cushions located between the atria and ventricles, eventually closing the orifice (ostium primum) between the atria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77749\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77749 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>A second orifice (the ostium secundum) develops in the septum primum; this orifice is covered by another septum (the septum secundum) that arises on the right atrial side of the septum primum. The septum secundum grows caudally and covers the ostium secundum. However, the septum secundum does not completely divide the atria, but leaves an oval orifice (the foramen ovale) that is covered but not sealed on the left side by the flexible flap of the septum primum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77749\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77749 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p>In the fetus, the foramen ovale is held open by the pressure gradient between the right and left atria; the right atrial pressure is higher than that of the left and pushes the flexible septum primum aside. At birth, expansion of the lungs lowers right heart pressures at the same time that systemic vascular resistance rises, causing reversal of the inter-atrial gradient. The septum primum is then held against the septum secundum and the interatrial shunt is abolished. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-atrial-septal-defects-asds-and-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-isolated-asds-in-children#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of atrial septal defects (ASDs), and clinical features and diagnosis of isolated ASDs in children&quot;, section on 'Perinatal physiology'</a>.)</p><p>In approximately 70 percent of individuals, the primum and secundum septa fuse after birth creating an intact interatrial septum. However, in a significant proportion of the population, the septa do not fuse. If the foramen ovale is completely covered but not sealed, it is called a &quot;probe patent&quot; or simply &quot;patent&quot; foramen ovale, indicating that the foramen can be opened by a reversal of the interatrial pressure gradient or by an intracardiac catheter. </p><p>Less commonly, an open communication persists between the atria after septation, attributable to an absence of sufficient tissue to septate the atria completely. Such a communication is called an atrial septal defect, with origin location and features as described below. A secundum atrial septal defect is a defect in the septum primum. A primum atrial septal defect is a defect in the septum secundum. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The various types of atrial septal defects (ASDs) are classified according to their location and the nature of the embryologic defect:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isolated ASDs result from abnormal development of the septa that partitions the common atrium of the developing heart into right and left chambers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrioventricular septal defects (AVSD, also known as atrioventricular canal or endocardial cushion defects) result primarily from <span class=\"nowrap\">maldevelopment/mal-alignment</span> of the partitioning of the AV canal by the endocardial cushions.</p><p/><p>Isolated ASDs include patent foramen ovale (PFO), ASD at the fossa ovalis (secundum ASD), superior sinus venosus defect, inferior sinus venosus defect, and coronary sinus defects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52106\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52106 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>AVSDs are by definition not isolated and include complete forms, incomplete forms, and common atrium. Primum ASDs are a type of AVSD that are typically associated with a cleft in the anterior mitral valve leaflet.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Secundum ASD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Defects in the foramen ovalis are classified as secundum type ASD. This type of ASD can result from poor growth of the secundum septum or excessive absorption of the primum septum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52106\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52106 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79348\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef79348 \">movie 1</a>). This defect accounts for 70 to 75 percent of all ASDs and is more common in females. </p><p>The rare combination of an ASD with mitral stenosis, the result of rheumatic valvulitis, is known as Lutembacher syndrome.</p><p>Although most cases of secundum ASD are isolated, some individuals have a family history of this defect with or without other congenital cardiac and extracardiac abnormalities. The best described genetic association is with the NKX 2-5 defect. These syndromes typically present in childhood or adolescence and are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-atrial-septal-defects-asds-and-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-isolated-asds-in-children#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of atrial septal defects (ASDs), and clinical features and diagnosis of isolated ASDs in children&quot;, section on 'Genetic disorders'</a>.)</p><p>Rarely, patients with a secundum ASD have a partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Primum ASD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primum type ASD develops if the primum septum does not fuse with the endocardial cushions, leaving a defect at the base of the interatrial septum that is usually large (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52106\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52106 \">figure 2</a>). This type of defect accounts for 15 to 20 percent of ASDs. It has been suggested that both partial and complete AV canal defects are related to maldevelopment of the ventricular septum rather than a decrease in atrial septal tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Given that the embryologic basis of primum ASDs are malformations in endocardial cushion development, they are nearly always associated with anomalies of the AV valves, particularly a cleft in the anterior mitral valve leaflet, with or without a contiguous defect in the inlet ventricular septum. When the combination of the primum ASD, cleft mitral valve, and an inlet ventricular septal defect are seen, this is called a transitional or partial AVSD. Discrete sub-aortic stenosis as well as elongation (often referred to as a &quot;goose-neck deformity&quot;) of the left ventricular outflow tract are often seen in association with endocardial cushion defects. The most severe form of AVSD (or endocardial cushion defect) is the complete atrio-ventricular septal (or canal) defect in which a primum atrial septal defect and inlet ventricular septal defect are present along with a common atrioventricular valve. Endocardial cushion defects are often noted in patients with Trisomy 21.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Sinus venosus ASD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sinus venosus defects account for 5 to 10 percent of atrial communications. These defects represent an abnormality in the insertion of the superior or inferior vena cava, which overrides the interatrial septum; the interatrial communication is then formed within the mouth of the overriding vein and is outside the area of the fossa ovalis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52106\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52106 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Because of this embryologic origin, sinus venosus defects are not technically ASDs in that the defect is with the sinus venosus septum and not the embryologic atrial septum. An anomalous connection involving one or more pulmonary veins is present in most patients with sinus venosus ASD (eg, 112 of 115 patients undergoing surgical repair) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Sinus venosus ASDs are of two types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Superior sinus venosus defects (sometimes called superior vena caval defects) are located in the atrial septum immediately below the orifice of the superior vena cava. The right upper lobe and middle lobe pulmonary veins often connect to the junction of the superior vena cava and right atrium, resulting in a partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inferior sinus venosus defects, also known as inferior vena caval defects, are less common. They are located in the atrial septum immediately above the orifice of the inferior vena cava. These defects are also often associated with partial anomalous connection of the right pulmonary veins.</p><p/><p>Even if the pulmonary veins are in their usual anatomic location, either of the right pulmonary veins may have its flow directed into the right atrium, depending upon the location of the sinus venosus defect. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=partial-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The hemodynamic effect of partial anomalous venous return depends upon the number of mal-placed pulmonary veins and the proportion of right ventricular stroke volume that perfuses the lung drained by these veins.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Unroofed coronary sinus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With unroofed coronary sinus (also known as a coronary sinus defect), part or all of the common wall between the coronary sinus and the left atrium is absent. This defect accounts for less than 1 percent of ASDs. Many such patients also have a persistent left superior vena cava or complex congenital heart disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Patent foramen ovale</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A PFO, which can be detected in approximately 25 to 30 percent of normal adult hearts, is another form of interatrial communication associated with shunting of blood. This lesion is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patent-foramen-ovale\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patent foramen ovale&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H256132242\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Communications in the atrial septum have several distinctive anatomic locations. (See <a href=\"#H256131897\" class=\"local\">'Embryology'</a> above.) However, the pathophysiology of each lesion is similar. With a small atrial septal defect, left atrial pressure is slightly higher than right atrial pressure, resulting in the flow of oxygenated blood from the left to the right atrium across the defect (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72533\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72533 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80448\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef80448 \">movie 2</a>).</p><p>The pressure gradient between the two atria and the amount of shunt flow depend upon the size of the defect and the relative distensibility of the right and left sides of the heart. Left-to-right shunting occurs primarily in late ventricular systole and early diastole, with some augmentation during atrial systole. Even when the right and left atrial pressures are equal, as occurs with a large defect, left-to-right shunting still occurs because of the greater compliance of the right compared to left ventricle. </p><p>However, shunting varies during the phases of the cardiac cycle&nbsp;and transient intra-cardiac right-to-left shunting in virtually all patients coincides with the onset of ventricular contraction, particularly under conditions&nbsp;of bradycardia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> decreased intrathoracic pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This explains the possibility for right-to-left shunting&nbsp;and neurologic events in patients who are not cyanotic. </p><p>The shunt flow constitutes a &quot;useless circuit&quot; through the right atrium, right ventricle, pulmonary circulation, left atrium, and through the defect back to the right atrium. The pulmonary flow to systemic flow ratio can be as high as 8:1 but, in asymptomatic young adults, is more likely to be in the range of 2:1 to 5:1. The increased flow leads to right-sided cardiac and pulmonary artery dilatation evident on chest radiograph and echocardiographic imaging. The main pulmonary arteries dilate and pulmonary vascularity increases. These changes may be evident on the chest radiograph, and large vessels in both the lower and upper lobes may be seen.</p><p>The right-sided volume overload is usually well tolerated for years. In select patients, development of pulmonary arteriopathy signals the onset of progressive pulmonary hypertension and its sequel tricuspid regurgitation, Eisenmenger syndrome with right ventricular failure, and right-to-left shunting of blood. The development of pulmonary hypertension is highly variable and depends not only on the size and duration of the shunt but on several unknown individual factors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-prognosis-of-eisenmenger-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and prognosis of Eisenmenger syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The natural course of isolated ASDs (which are primarily secundum ASDs) varies from spontaneous closure to enlarging defects and increasing symptoms with age. Most secundum ASDs less than 8 mm in diameter close spontaneously by two to five years of age. Secundum ASDs &ge;8 mm in diameter and other types of ASDs are unlikely to close spontaneously. Spontaneous closure of a secundum ASD is unusual in older children and adults and defect size tends to increase with age. Primum ASDs, sinus venosus defects, and coronary sinus defects do not close spontaneously. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-atrial-septal-defects-asds-and-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-isolated-asds-in-children#H1039317383\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of atrial septal defects (ASDs), and clinical features and diagnosis of isolated ASDs in children&quot;, section on 'Natural history'</a>.) </p><p>Increases in left-to-right shunting with age (due to relative increases in the left versus right ventricular end diastolic pressures) in many patients with uncorrected moderate to large ASDs increase the likelihood of developing symptoms and complications as described in the next section. The increase in ASD size over time also has important implications for treatment, since there is the potential that ASD enlargement will be sufficient to preclude the use of percutaneous transcatheter closure with specific devices. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-for-closure-and-medical-management-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications for closure and medical management of atrial septal defects in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is estimated that most patients with an atrial septal defect (ASD) and significant shunt flow (ie, pulmonary to systemic flow more than 2:1) will become symptomatic and require surgical correction by the age of 40 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, some patients do not become symptomatic until 60 years of age or older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Patients with unexplained right ventricular volume overload should be referred for evaluation of possible obscure ASD, including coronary sinus ASD or partial anomalous venous connection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Initial symptoms associated with an ASD may be mild and ignored by the patient. As an example, in one series of 32 patients diagnosed by incidental findings on physical examination, chest radiograph, or echocardiography who were thought to be asymptomatic, exercise tolerance improved after closure of the ASD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Atrial arrhythmias, exercise intolerance, fatigue, dyspnea, and overt heart failure are common manifestations of symptomatic ASDs. In the series cited above of 481 patients with a secundum ASD who were seen between 1957 and 1976 and who underwent surgery before the age of 40, more than one-half had symptoms of dyspnea and fatigue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Atrial arrhythmias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atrial arrhythmias are a common manifestation of an ASD. In three series with a total of over 600 patients, atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter was present in almost 20 percent overall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/8,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11,12</a>].

In a report of 211 adults, the incidence of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter prior to surgery was 1 percent for those aged 18 to 40, 30 percent for those aged 40 to 60, and 80 percent in those over the age of 60 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

As a result, pulmonary artery pressures do not rise significantly unless the volume of pulmonary blood flow exceeds 2.5 times baseline. The development of pulmonary vascular injury is related to the degree and duration of right heart volume overload. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-pulmonary-arterial-hypertension-group-1#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The epidemiology and pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (Group 1)&quot;, section on 'Congenital heart disease'</a>.)</p><p>Moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension is relatively uncommon in patients with an ASD, being present in less than 10 percent of adults at the time of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/8,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,18</a>]. Patients with a sinus venosus defect have higher pulmonary artery pressures and resistances and develop pulmonary hypertension at an earlier age compared to patients with other forms of ASD. For example, in a study of 169 patients, pulmonary hypertension was present in 26 percent of those with a sinus venosus defect compared to 9 percent with an isolated secundum ASD; elevated pulmonary vascular resistance was present in 16 and 4 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The differences in pulmonary artery pressures between sinus venosus and secundum ASD patients remained when patients were stratified by age.</p><p>The development of severe irreversible pulmonary hypertension or Eisenmenger syndrome with pulmonary arterial pressure at systemic or supra systemic levels and predominantly right to left shunting is now uncommon because of surgical or percutaneous correction of the defect. However, there may be an appreciable lifetime incidence of severe pulmonary hypertension in unoperated ASDs, with some older estimates being approximately 50 percent. Although Eisenmenger syndrome is much less common with ASDs than with ventricular septal defects, ASDs have been a common cause of the syndrome because of their greater prevalence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Multivariate analysis showed that pulmonary artery systolic pressure &gt;40 mmHg, Qp:Qs ratio &gt;2.5:1, and New York Heart Association functional class III or IV were significant risk factors for mortality, while surgical treatment was associated with reduced mortality.

In these cases, some unusual anatomic feature is responsible for directing unoxygenated blood across the defect to the left atrium in the absence of a reversed pressure gradient. Examples include severe tricuspid valve regurgitation as seen in Ebstein&rsquo;s anomaly, right atrial masses, prominent Eustachian valves, distortion of the usual anatomy by a dilated coronary sinus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], and orthodeoxia-platypnea syndrome, which is discussed separately.

Eventually, large left-to-right shunts can lead to one or more of the following findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An enlarged and hyperdynamic right ventricle can produce a right ventricular heave that is most pronounced along the left sternal border and in the subxiphoid area. It can also cause chest wall deformity with asymmetry and a left precordial bulge.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enlargement of the pulmonary artery may be associated with a palpable pulmonary artery impulse at the left upper sternal border. This may be more pronounced in patients with pulmonary hypertension.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Heart sounds</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The characteristic auscultatory finding in ASDs with large left-to-right shunts and normal pulmonary artery pressure is wide, fixed splitting of the second heart sound (S2), in contrast to the normal variation in splitting during the respiratory cycle. The second sound should be evaluated when the patient is sitting or standing because splitting may be relatively wide but not fixed in the supine position. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-heart-sounds\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of heart sounds&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Fixed splitting is thought to result from altered characteristics of the pulmonary vascular bed associated with increased pulmonary blood flow. In all individuals, the aortic and pulmonic closure sounds (A2 and P2) occur shortly after (but not instantly after) ventricular pressure falls below arterial pressure. The delay between the ventricular pressure drop and valve closure is referred to as the &quot;hangout time,&quot; and is the delay due to pressure recoil from the arterial bed.</p><p>In the systemic arterial circulation, the hangout time is short because of high aortic impedance and rapid pressure recoil; it does not vary with respiration. In contrast, the pulmonary hangout time is longer, because of the greater compliance of the pulmonary vascular bed, and is prolonged by inspiration, which increases pulmonary capacitance. As a result, P2 normally occurs after A2, and this separation (&quot;splitting&quot;) of S2 increases with inspiration.</p><p>With an ASD, the capacitance of the pulmonary bed is increased throughout the respiratory cycle without much respiratory variation. The increased and constant capacitance results in an increased and fixed hangout time, with wide splitting between the first and second components of the S2 and little respiratory variation.</p><p>The intensities of the pulmonic and aortic components of S2 are equal in most patients with an uncomplicated ASD. Patients with pulmonary hypertension usually have an accentuated pulmonic component of S2. A similar finding is occasionally seen with normal pulmonary pressures, because of the proximity of the dilated pulmonary artery to the chest wall.</p><p>The first heart sound (S1), which is heard best at the apex and lower left sternal border, is often split and the second component (tricuspid closure) is intensified in patients with an ASD. An explanation for this increase in intensity is that the large volume of diastolic blood flow from right atrium to right ventricle presses the tricuspid leaflets toward the right ventricular wall and the forceful right ventricular contraction causes the tricuspid leaflets to move abruptly cephalad during systole.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Heart murmurs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The shunt flow across the ASD has too low a velocity and produces too little turbulence to be audible, although it can be demonstrated by phonocardiography. However, several other murmurs may be heard. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of cardiac murmurs in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A mid-systolic pulmonary flow or ejection murmur, resulting from the increased blood flow across the pulmonic valve, is classically present with moderate to large left-to-right shunts. This murmur is loudest over the second left intercostal space and is usually not associated with a thrill. The presence of a thrill typically indicates a very large shunt or pulmonic stenosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A murmur of mitral regurgitation may also be heard due to a cleft mitral valve in ostium primum defects and mitral valve prolapse in secundum defects. In the latter setting, an apical late or holosystolic murmur of mitral regurgitation may be heard radiating to the axilla.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A diastolic rumble due to the increased flow across the tricuspid valve may be heard by a careful examiner but is usually quite subtle. The rumble is accentuated by inspiration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A low-pitched diastolic murmur of pulmonic regurgitation may result from dilatation of the pulmonary artery.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Right-to-left shunting due to pulmonary hypertension in the occasional patient with ASD may be associated with the following auscultatory findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A right ventricular fourth heart sound</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A mid-systolic ejection click</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A mid-systolic pulmonic murmur that is softer and shorter because the ejected stroke volume is less</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No tricuspid flow murmur</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased intensity of the pulmonic component of S2, but no fixed splitting</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pulmonic insufficiency murmur, if present, is high-pitched</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A holosystolic murmur of tricuspid insufficiency may result from right ventricular and atrial enlargement</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Eisenmenger syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of Eisenmenger physiology is accompanied by cyanosis, and clubbing, in addition to the auscultatory features of pulmonary hypertension described above. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-prognosis-of-eisenmenger-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and prognosis of Eisenmenger syndrome&quot;</a>.) As the disease progresses, features of right ventricular failure (including elevated jugular venous pressure, hepatic congestion, tricuspid regurgitation, and pedal edema) are noted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H344760002\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL TESTS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrocardiogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An electrocardiogram (ECG) is routinely performed in patients with suspected atrial septal defect (ASD). The ECG may be normal with an uncomplicated ASD and small shunt. Most affected individuals have normal sinus rhythm, but atrial arrhythmias often occur beyond the third decade (especially atrial fibrillation but also atrial flutter and supraventricular tachycardia).</p><p>P waves are typically normal with secundum ASDs. In comparison, sinus venosus defects are often associated with a leftward frontal plane P-wave axis (ie, negative in leads III and aVF and positive in lead aVL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. This leftward shift is caused by an ectopic pacemaker resulting from an ASD located near the sinus node.</p><p>First degree atrioventricular (AV) block can occur in any type of ASD, but is classically present in ostium primum defects in association with complete right bundle branch block and left anterior fascicular block. The rim of the ostium primum defect is in close spatial relationship to the His bundle, accounting for abnormalities of impulse conduction through this area.</p><p>The frontal plane QRS axis often ranges from +95&ordm; to +135&ordm; (right axis deviation) with a clockwise loop. Northwest QRS axis usually suggests the presence of an AV canal defect.</p><p>The QRS complex is often slightly prolonged and has a characteristic rSr' or rsR' pattern that is thought to result from disproportionate thickening of the right ventricular outflow tract, which is the last portion of the ventricle to depolarize. This pattern, which is often described as incomplete right bundle branch block, results from hypertrophy rather than a conduction disturbance. Patients with increasing pulmonary hypertension tend to lose the rSr' pattern in V1 and develop a tall monophasic R wave with a deeply inverted T wave.</p><p>A notch on the R wave in the inferior leads (a pattern called &quot;crochetage&quot;) has also been suggested as a sensitive and specific ECG sign of ASD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F96067\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef96067 \">waveform 1</a>). In one report, this finding was present in 73 percent of patients with ASD versus 7.4 percent of normals, 36 percent of ventricular septal defects, and 23 percent of patients with pulmonic stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In patients with ASD, it correlates with the size of the defect and the degree of left-to-right shunt. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Chest radiograph</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The chest radiograph reflects the dilatation of the right atrium, right ventricle, and pulmonary arteries. Left atrial enlargement may be seen if there is associated mitral regurgitation. Shunt vascularity is characterized by enlarged main and branch pulmonary arteries, without redistribution of flow to the apical pulmonary vessels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64946\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64946 \">image 1</a>).</p><p>In comparison to these classic findings, the radiographic appearance in patients diagnosed at a later age may be atypical. The atypical findings include normal vasculature, evidence of pulmonary venous hypertension, left atrial enlargement, and pulmonary edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In one study, atypical findings were more common in patients over the age of 50 (30 versus 6 percent in younger subjects) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H344760072\"><span class=\"h2\">Echocardiogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Echocardiography is the primary test for the diagnosis of ASDs.

A patent foramen ovale is a foramen that is covered by the septum primum but is not sealed shut in approximately 25 to 30 percent of normal subjects. (See <a href=\"#H256131897\" class=\"local\">'Embryology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pressure gradient between the two atria and the amount of shunt flow depends upon the size of the ASD, and the relative distensibility of the right and left ventricles.
