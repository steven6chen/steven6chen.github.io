Once the decision to transfuse RBCs has been made, the most appropriate RBC product must be chosen. Donated whole blood used for transfusion is modified in several ways that remove varying proportions of non-red cell components, thereby allowing selection of RBC products based upon clinical needs.</p><p>This topic will review the different RBC products and indications for their use in infants and children.

Whole blood has been used in the following circumstances; however, reconstituted blood (ie, RBCs combined with fresh frozen plasma) is more commonly used for these indications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-selection-of-blood-products/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients undergoing major cardiac surgery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Newborns with severe hemolytic disease or hyperbilirubinemia undergoing exchange transfusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients undergoing massive transfusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)</p><p/><p>The use of fresh whole blood for pediatric cardiac surgery is controversial. In the past, fresh whole blood (generally less than 48 hours old) was used for infants undergoing cardiac surgery because it was reported to improve hemostasis, but this is not a standard practice due to lack of supportive evidence and concerns that it may increase perioperative fluid accumulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-selection-of-blood-products/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Leukoreduced RBCs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>&quot;Leukoreduction&quot; refers to the removal of white blood cells (WBCs) from blood products by highly efficient filters that reduce the number of WBCs by more than 99.9 percent, generally to &lt;1 x 10<sup>6</sup> WBCs per red cell unit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-selection-of-blood-products/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Though this process greatly reduces the number of WBCs, the few remaining WBCs are capable of replication and can cause transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD) in susceptible individuals. As a result, irradiation of the RBCs is required to prevent TA-GVHD. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Irradiated RBCs'</a> below.)</p><p>The use of leukoreduced RBCs reduces the risk of the following adverse consequences of transfused WBCs. A more complete discussion of the role of leukoreduction in preventing adverse effects of transfused WBCs is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leukoreduction-to-prevent-complications-of-blood-transfusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Leukoreduction to prevent complications of blood transfusion&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reaction &ndash; Febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions appear to be mediated by leukocyte-derived cytokines and direct donor cell leukocyte interactions. Leukoreduction significantly reduces but does not completely eliminate these reactions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) alloimmunization &ndash; HLA alloimmunization can be induced by HLA antigens expressed on donor leukocytes in recipients who receive multiple transfusions. Allosensitization increases the risk of graft rejection in children who subsequently receive organ or hematopoietic cell transplantation. It also increases platelet refractoriness in patients who need multiple platelet transfusions, (eg, children with leukemia or other malignancies). Leukoreduction reduces the incidence of alloimmunization.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection &ndash; Leukoreduction reduces the transmission of infectious agents that are harbored in WBCs, notably cytomegalovirus (CMV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-selection-of-blood-products/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transfusion-associated immunomodulation &ndash; Transfusion of allogeneic blood has an immunosuppressive effect, which is known as transfusion-associated immunomodulation (TRIM). WBCs are felt to have a major causative role in TRIM and leukoreduction is thought to reduce immunosuppression, but this purported benefit of leukoreduction is not well established and is controversial. Indirect support for this hypothesis is provided by reports of decreased postoperative infections in adults who received leukoreduced RBCs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">TRIM may also result in autoimmune tissue damage, as illustrated in a study of young children undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-selection-of-blood-products/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Patients who received leukoreduced blood had lower levels of malondialdehyde (a marker of cardiac ischemic injury) compared with those who received blood without leukoreduction. Despite these reports, the role of leukoreduction in decreasing TRIM remains uncertain.</p><p/><p>In addition to reducing adverse effects of RBC transfusion, it has been suggested that the removal of WBCs makes transfusion physically easier, especially through the small catheters that may be required in newborns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-selection-of-blood-products/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, evidence to support this is limited.</p><p>Because leukoreduction reduces febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions, prevents alloimmunization, and reduces the transmission of certain infections, many blood centers in the United States and other countries have adopted a policy of &quot;universal leukoreduction,&quot; in which all RBC and apheresis platelet products are leukoreduced. However, there is substantial variation in practice and debate about the wisdom of this policy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leukoreduction-to-prevent-complications-of-blood-transfusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Leukoreduction to prevent complications of blood transfusion&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinician should be aware of the policies of the local blood center and should specifically order leukoreduced products if they are desired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-selection-of-blood-products/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

However, it remains unclear whether leukoreduction and CMV-seronegative products are equivalent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-selection-of-blood-products/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. Note that irradiation does <strong>not</strong> produce a CMV-safe product because the dose of irradiation used is not sufficient to kill viruses.</p><p>The transmission of CMV by transfusion is well known. CMV-reduced risk RBCs should be used for the following populations (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cytomegalovirus-infections-in-children#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cytomegalovirus infections in children&quot;, section on 'Blood products and organ donors'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preterm infants born to CMV-seronegative mothers (who have no protective antibodies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-selection-of-blood-products/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. CMV infection in neonates can range in severity from asymptomatic infection to a severe life-threatening disease. Symptomatic CMV infection is more common in infants born to CMV-negative mothers. Some neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) use CMV-seronegative RBCs for all neonates, in addition to leukocyte reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-selection-of-blood-products/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

However, rare transmission of CMV has been documented when the donor is viremic and in the &quot;window period&quot; following exposure to the virus, and before the development of antibodies, or when the antibody titer is below the limits of detection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-selection-of-blood-products/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>].</p><p>In American populations, 40 to 90 percent of donors are CMV-seropositive. As a result, there may not be sufficient CMV-seronegative donors to fill the need for CMV-safe blood products. Fortunately, leukoreduction also reduces the risk of transmission of CMV, although rare cases of CMV have been associated with transfusion of either leukoreduced or seronegative blood products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-selection-of-blood-products/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

TA-GVHD is caused by viable donor lymphocytes that are transfused into a patient who either does not recognize these cells as foreign or does not have the capacity to destroy them. TA-GVHD usually begins 8 to 10 days following transfusion and is almost inevitably fatal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-associated-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Gamma irradiation of the blood product at a standard dose prior to transfusion stops proliferation of foreign lymphocytes, which entirely prevents TA-GVHD. However, the dose of radiation used for cellular blood products is not sufficient to kill viruses. Thus, irradiation does not provide a CMV-safe product and does not eliminate the need for either leukoreduction or CMV-seronegative blood products if a CMV-safe product is required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-selection-of-blood-products/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Conversely, leukoreduction does not eliminate all viable donor lymphocytes, and leukoreduced but nonirradiated products can result in TA-GVHD disease.

TA-GVHD may develop in a partial HLA match when the recipient is heterozygous at an HLA allele for which the donor is homozygous. In these instances, donor WBCs will not be recognized as foreign by the host, but the donor cells may recognize host cells as foreign and mount a TA-GVHD reaction. There is an increased likelihood of this occurring in blood relatives or if the donor and recipient are members of a population that is genetically homogeneous. As a result, blood products donated by family members should be irradiated before transfusing into a blood relative.

Washing of irradiated RBCs is the most effective method for removing excess potassium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-selection-of-blood-products/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Washing of irradiated RBCs should be reserved for selected situations since it reduces the volume of RBCs available and may minimize the efficacy of the transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-selection-of-blood-products/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Sickle cell negative blood</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood that is &quot;sickle cell negative&quot; has been tested by a rapid screen for the presence of hemoglobin S (HbS).

Autologous donations have been widely used in adults when elective surgery that routinely requires blood transfusion is planned. In the pediatric setting, autologous donations are essentially limited to orthopedic surgery, and especially for scoliosis surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-selection-of-blood-products/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Use of autologous blood avoids most (but not all) of the infectious risks associated with transfusion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-blood-conservation-preoperative-autologous-blood-donation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical blood conservation: Preoperative autologous blood donation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although autologous donation programs are generally safe and may reduce allogeneic blood use, they also lead to substantial wastage of the blood product [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-selection-of-blood-products/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. This is because up to 50 percent of autologous RBC units are not transfused [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-selection-of-blood-products/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. For safety reasons, units collected for autologous transfusion are discarded rather than released to other recipients.

Children as young as eight years have been donors. Blood should only be drawn if the donor's hemoglobin level is at least 11.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> or the hematocrit is at least 33 percent. In any consideration of autologous donation for children, one must consider the ability of the child to donate, both in physical size (including ease of venous access) and developmental maturity. The units are usually used as whole blood, and do not have the same procoagulant activity as products that are collected and stored as separate platelet or plasma components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-selection-of-blood-products/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Directed donations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Directed units are allogeneic units designated for a particular patient. Most often, parents or other family members donate specifically for a patient, but friends or other acquaintances are also recruited. These donors must meet all the usual criteria for donation, although a reduced interval between donations may be authorized if medically appropriate. Delays may arise in finding donors of appropriate type, or in finding CMV-seronegative donors if such are requested. Direct units have a risk of transmission of infectious disease similar to the general blood supply, but families are often more comfortable with such transfusions than with donations from the population at large. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=directed-designated-blood-donation-programs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Directed (designated) blood donation programs&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Directed donations reduce the number of donor exposures for children who will be multiply transfused, since platelets and red blood cells can be obtained repeatedly from the same donor, particularly if apheresis techniques are used. Under most conditions, directed units will be used for other patients if not needed by the specified patient. If blood relatives donate, the units should be irradiated to prevent the development of graft-versus-host disease.

In emergency situations, any neonate requiring transfusion can be issued group O, Rh(D) negative RBCs. In non-emergency settings, the infant's blood is tested for ABO and Rh(D) type, and a screen is performed for unexpected RBC antibodies, using plasma or serum from the infant or mother [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-selection-of-blood-products/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Testing for anti-D is particularly critical because this antibody is found in infants whose mothers were given Rh(D) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">immune globulin</a>.</p><p>There are two approaches to RBC transfusion of newborns: use of group O, Rh(D) negative blood to all newborns, or use of ABO- and Rh(D)-compatible RBC. Institution-specific guidelines should be followed; these are generally developed based on the frequency of newborn transfusions and available blood products:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Group O, Rh(D) negative RBCs for all neonates &ndash; Some institutions use this approach for all transfusions to neonates and infants younger than four months old, to simplify blood banking procedures. Possible risks of this approach are that the group O RBCs may include a small amount of anti-A or anti-B in the associated plasma, which can cause hemolysis in the infant with blood types A, B, or AB. This concern is most relevant in preterm infants because of their small blood volume. Some institutions wash the RBC prior to transfusion to remove these antibodies and reduce the risk of hemolysis; this can also be done for preterm infants.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ABO- and Rh(D)-compatible RBCs &ndash; Some institutions issue ABO- and Rh(D)-compatible RBCs. In this case, the infant must <strong>also</strong> be tested for &quot;passive&quot; anti-A and anti-B (ie, anti-A or anti-B of maternal origin). These antibodies are detected by an indirect antiglobulin (Coombs) test, which can be done on the infant's plasma. If anti-A or anti-B are detected, RBCs lacking the corresponding antigen must be transfused.</p><p/><p>Infants requiring transfusion because of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) require additional considerations when selecting RBCs for transfusion, as outlined below. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn'</a> below.)</p><p>Other aspects of RBC transfusion in the newborn, including the indications and administration, are discussed in a separate topic review.

This approach minimizes the amount of blood that must be drawn from small infants for laboratory testing. A newborn may acquire passive anti-A or anti-B through a transfusion of ABO-incompatible plasma or platelets, or through massive transfusion. In this case, a transfusion of group O RBC may be given.

These antibodies arise in the mother as the direct result of a blood group incompatibility between the mother and fetus. HDFN can be caused by Rh(D) incompatibility, ABO incompatibility, or other blood group incompatibility between mother and infant. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postnatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-hemolytic-disease-of-the-fetus-and-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postnatal diagnosis and management of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For infants with HDFN, Group O, Rh(D)-negative or Rh(D)-compatible RBCs are usually used for simple transfusion or exchange transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-selection-of-blood-products/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

If an exchange transfusion is needed, the RBCs described above are reconstituted with AB plasma (this plasma contains no anti-A or anti-B) or ABO-compatible plasma.</p><p>A history of intrauterine transfusions for HDFN further complicates compatibility testing.

Transfusion in this setting can be complex because erythroid engraftment may be delayed if the recipient has strong antibodies to donated cells. Generally, donor type O or compatible RBCs are washed to remove incompatible plasma. Products containing plasma should be compatible with both donor and recipient cells. These precautions are continued until recipient antibodies are no longer detected.

If the group and type are not known, O RBCs and AB platelets and plasma are used; if the recipient is a female the RBCs should be Rh(D)-negative, to avoid Rh(D) sensitization that could affect a future pregnancy.</p><p>Uncrossmatched blood for emergent transfusion is generally safe, particularly if the child has not been previously transfused and cannot be expected to have developed red cell antibodies.

Massive transfusion increases risk for a variety of metabolic and hemostatic abnormalities, particularly in neonates and infants. Dilutional coagulopathy may occur if only RBCs have been transfused; as a result, plasma and platelets should be included for patients receiving a massive transfusion. Trauma also can contribute to an acute coagulopathy, through a variety of mechanisms. Electrolytes and acid-base balance should be monitored carefully, since the large amount of stored blood products transfused in this setting may lead to serious hyperkalemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-selection-of-blood-products/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

Approximately 30 to 40 percent of patients with SCD will develop at least one antibody and, over the course of years of transfusion, multiple antibodies. In order to find compatible units for transfusion, it may be necessary to procure units of RBCs from a rare donor bank; however, even with this strategy it may be impossible to provide fully compatible blood. Some patients with SCD develop autoantibodies <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> have an unexplained delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction, a phenomenon that is poorly understood. Hemolysis also may occur in the absence of RBC antibodies; this condition is known as &quot;hyperhemolysis&quot; and is characterized by an acute decrease in hemoglobin after the transfusion. The direct antiglobulin test (DAT, also known as Coombs test) is usually negative. The patient's reticulocyte count also drops from the baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-selection-of-blood-products/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

As a result, every available donor unit may appear to be incompatible by crossmatch. It is important for the blood bank to exclude the simultaneous presence of alloantibodies that have developed from previous transfusion(s). If alloantibodies can be excluded, hemolytic transfusion reactions will be rare even if the blood that is incompatible is used. Despite the risks, transfusion therapy should never be withheld from a patient with AIHA and life-threatening anemia.

Leukoreduction is widely used in infants and children to reduce febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions, prevent alloimmunization, and reduce the transmission of certain infections (notably cytomegalovirus [CMV]). However, leukoreduction does not eliminate all lymphocytes. Therefore, blood products given to patients at risk for transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD) should also be irradiated.
