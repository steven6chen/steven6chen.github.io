Although it does not provide any normative data on children less than a year old, limited data suggest that BP is relatively unchanged between the neonatal period and one year of age.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study that measured systolic BP by Doppler ultrasound and sphygmomanometer, the mean BPs in male infants at six months and at one year of age were 92&plusmn;13 mmHg and 94&plusmn;12, and in female infants, mean BPs at six months of age and at one year of age were 93&plusmn;14 mmHg and 93&plusmn;11 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hypertension-in-infants-between-one-month-and-one-year-of-age/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The mean systolic BP rose from 76 mmHg at age four days to 96 mmHg at age six weeks, and showed little further variation at six months and one year. Blood pressure was nearly normally distributed at all ages, and the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile for BP was 95 mmHg at four days and 113 mmHg between six weeks and one year.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective study of 406 healthy term infants, no change in oscillometric BP measurements was noted between 6 and 12 months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hypertension-in-infants-between-one-month-and-one-year-of-age/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The median systolic and diastolic BPs at 6 months of age were 102 (range 72 to 131) and 62.5 (range 34 to 81), and median values at 12 months were 101 (range 75 to 130) and 64 (range 41 to 84), respectively.

For each 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> increase in BMI, systolic pressure increased by 1.1 mmHg and diastolic pressure by 0.4 mmHg.</p><p>The effect of postnatal growth pattern and ethnic differences on the BP in young children was also reported in a prospective study in 560 South Asian infants who were followed from birth to 3 and 12 months of age. Weight gain during the first three months appeared to correlate with higher systolic BP at one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hypertension-in-infants-between-one-month-and-one-year-of-age/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Given the limited amount of available information in infants below one year of age, the above results suggest that normative data for one-year-old children can be used to help determine whether infantile BP values are excessive and guide BP management in affected patients.

This was illustrated in a retrospective study of 650 infants discharged from neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hypertension-in-infants-between-one-month-and-one-year-of-age/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

The data from the National High Blood Pressure Education Program (NHBPEP) Fourth Task Force Report are based on ausculatory measurements, whereas the data presented previously are obtained by oscillometric measurements. Because accurate measurement of BP by auscultation in young infants is often difficult, initial BP measurement in this age group is typically performed by oscillometric devices. If using the NHBPEP Fourth Task Force Report tables to determine the BP percentile, one needs to verify the BP by auscultation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-diagnosis-of-hypertension-in-children-and-adolescents#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and diagnosis of hypertension in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Oscillometric devices'</a>.)</p><p>Using the appropriately sized arm cuff is vital for accurate BP measurement. The appropriate size is a cuff with an inflatable bladder width that is at least 40 percent of the arm circumference at a point midway between the olecranon and the acromion, and the bladder length should cover 80 to 100 percent of the circumference of the arm. The NHBPEP Task Force recommends an arm cuff bladder that is 6 cm wide and 12 cm long for an infant with a maximum arm circumference of 15 cm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58304\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58304 \">table 2</a>). If the choice is between a cuff that is too small or one that is too large, use of the larger cuff will result in less error.

As a result, a high index of suspicion is important to identify infants beyond the neonatal period who are at risk for hypertension, so that hypertension can be diagnosed and managed appropriately.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As is true in older children, hypertension in infants is defined as either systolic or diastolic BP that is &ge;95<sup>th</sup> normative BP percentile measured upon three or more separate occasions. However, there is limited information on normal BP in infants less than one year of age. Currently available literature suggests that normative data from one-year-old children can be used to help guide BP management in younger infants. (See <a href=\"#H21347114\" class=\"local\">'Normal blood pressure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The causes of hypertension in infants between one month and one year of age are similar to those seen in patients with neonatal hypertension. In addition, many of these patients develop hypertension because of neonatal complications, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, renovascular injury due to umbilical artery catheterization, renal vein thrombosis, and neurologic sequelae (eg, intraventricular hemorrhage). Other causes of infantile hypertension include congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), endocrine disorders (eg, congenital adrenal hyperplasia and hyperthyroidism), medications, and coarctation of the aorta. (See <a href=\"#H3752835\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because the incidence of hypertension is low in children less than three years of age, routine BP monitoring is not recommended unless the patient is at risk for hypertension. Infants at risk for hypertension include those with complications that required admission to a neonatal intensive care unit, congenital heart disease, CAKUT, and other illnesses and conditions associated with hypertension. (See <a href=\"#H3752827\" class=\"local\">'Who should be evaluated'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BP measurement in infants should be performed in a standardized approach that routinely measures BP in the same extremity and position, using an appropriate size BP cuff in a quietly awake or sleeping infant. (See <a href=\"#H21347121\" class=\"local\">'Blood pressure measurement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of hypertension is made when repeat BP values on three separate occasions are greater than the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile for age. Because there are no normative data that contain 95<sup>th</sup> percentile BP values for infants less than one year of age, we use the following threshold based on currently available data. (See <a href=\"#H21347142\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For infants with an oscillometric awake BP of <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;100/70,</span> management consists of confirmation with manual reading and follow-up BP monitoring. An evaluation for an underlying cause is initiated for confirmed BP of <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;110/70</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Treatment is generally initiated for BP persistently <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;110/65,</span> or sooner if left ventricular hypertrophy is present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once it has been determined that the infant is hypertensive, an evaluation is performed to identify the cause of hypertension, treat any curable cause, and determine the extent of target organ damage. Because the causes of hypertension in this age group are often due to perinatal events, the evaluation is similar to that performed for neonatal hypertension.
