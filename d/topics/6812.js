This approach is based upon the availability of non-operative therapy for most symptomatic stones and avoids unnecessary therapy in those who would not have a recurrence.</p><p>The limited evaluation should include routine blood chemistries. At least one repeated measurement of serum calcium should be performed in patients whose first value is high-normal since most patients with urolithiasis due to primary hyperparathyroidism, a surgically correctable disease, have values between 10.2 and 11 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.55 and 2.75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-patient-with-established-nephrolithiasis-and-treatment-if-stone-composition-is-unknown/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

This approach should be followed only in individuals willing to make dietary changes or to take medical therapy if warranted by the work-up. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'The complete metabolic evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>Support for this approach comes from a retrospective analysis of male calcium stone formers that found that the likelihood of relapse on medical therapy was directly correlated with the number of pretreatment symptomatic stones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-patient-with-established-nephrolithiasis-and-treatment-if-stone-composition-is-unknown/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The presence and subsequent growth of multiple stones that were originally too small to detect with available imaging modalities could be one explanation for this observation. Thus, waiting for a patient to declare as a multiple stone former may decrease the response to medical therapy. In addition, some studies suggest that residual stone fragments following either shock wave lithotripsy or percutaneous stone removal may facilitate the formation of new stones, and that selective medical therapy may reduce the chance of recurrent stone formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-patient-with-established-nephrolithiasis-and-treatment-if-stone-composition-is-unknown/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>].

At the least, one should wait until the patient has completely recovered from any surgical interventions and make sure that the urine is not infected or the collecting system obstructed. We generally suggest waiting one to two months after the last stone episode since the patient may have temporarily modified their diet.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT IF STONE COMPOSITION IS UNKNOWN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For a patient with recurrent stone disease (but the type of stone is unknown), it is reasonable to assume that the stone is calcium based. In this setting, certain disorders associated with calcium nephrolithiasis should be excluded as possible underlying causes. Although one cannot distinguish between calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate stones radiographically, this is less important, because the evaluation will be the same for both stone types.</p><p>However, if a patient is a recurrent stone former, then it should be made clear to the patient and the treating urologist that a stone <strong>must</strong> be sent for analysis if possible from the next stone episode. Information about stone composition will then allow for more tailored treatment recommendations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=interpretation-of-kidney-stone-composition-analysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Interpretation of kidney stone composition analysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If stone composition is unknown, then treatment recommendations to prevent future stone episodes will be influenced by the 24-hour urine results and the clinical picture.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H723846\"><span class=\"h2\">High urine calcium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the urine calcium is elevated, then attempts to lower the urine calcium concentration should be instituted (often a thiazide diuretic will be necessary). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of recurrent calcium stones in adults&quot;, section on 'High urine calcium'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, primary hyperparathyroidism, sarcoidosis, and distal (type 1) renal tubular acidosis should also be considered in the patient with increased urine calcium levels.

Supplementing alkali intake (eg, potassium citrate or potassium bicarbonate) will increase urinary citrate excretion. However, this will also raise the urinary pH. If the predominant calcium salt is calcium phosphate, which forms more readily in an alkaline urine, supplementation with alkali such as citrate (which is metabolized to bicarbonate in the body) may, in fact, accelerate the rate of stone formation. In this case, the urine pH may be a useful guide. If the urine pH is 6.5 or higher, the use of citrate supplements should be used with caution (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of recurrent calcium stones in adults&quot;, section on 'Low urine citrate'</a>). Since citrate inhibits calcium phosphate crystallization, it remains unclear whether the inhibition by citrate or the promotion by increasing pH predominates. Patients with renal tubular acidosis, for instance, seem to benefit from citrate supplementation despite the potential alkalinization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H723861\"><span class=\"h2\">High urine oxalate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If high urine oxalate is present, a low-oxalate diet should be tried first. The primary foods to avoid are spinach, potatoes, and almonds.

Even if the urine calcium is high, increasing dietary calcium or adding an over the counter <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-citrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium citrate</a> supplement with meals should be considered in addition to a low-oxalate diet if the low-oxalate diet alone is insufficient. However, the amount of urinary oxalate that is derived from the diet is quite variable; thus, if a patient adheres to a low-oxalate diet and the urine oxalate does not fall, then the oxalate restriction can be removed.

This will increase the urine flow rate and lower the urine solute concentration, both of which protect against stone formation. Fluid should be ingested throughout the day, and the volume should be increased when sweat losses are greater, such as at higher ambient temperatures and with exercise. While ingestion of water near bedtime or during the night will reduce urine concentration, the disruption to sleep needs to be considered before making this recommendation.</p><p>The efficacy of increasing fluid intake was illustrated in a controlled trial in which 199 patients with a first calcium stone were randomly assigned to no therapy or recommendation of a high fluid intake to produce two liters of urine per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-patient-with-established-nephrolithiasis-and-treatment-if-stone-composition-is-unknown/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Treatment if stone composition is unknown'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If stone composition is unknown, then treatment recommendations to prevent future stone episodes will be influenced by the 24-hour urine results and the clinical picture: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the urine calcium is elevated, then attempts to lower the urine calcium concentration should be instituted (often a thiazide diuretic will be necessary). (See <a href=\"#H723846\" class=\"local\">'High urine calcium'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the citrate is low, then supplementing alkali intake (eg, potassium citrate or potassium bicarbonate) will increase urinary citrate excretion. If the urine pH is 6.5 or higher, the use of citrate supplements should be used with caution. (See <a href=\"#H723853\" class=\"local\">'Low urine citrate'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If high urine oxalate is present, a low-oxalate diet should be tried first. The following site contains the oxalate value for different foods: <a href=\"https://regepi.bwh.harvard.edu/health/nutrition.html&amp;token=tNBv9GZbg9Tgg0eyEGmf20hEneIDl3YmTrQDjNMJCR31ChhQUCHp82EhBE/DJDbSKKx/am9ijqBlgEelLm1FgQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=7367\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">https://regepi.bwh.harvard.edu/health/nutrition.html</a>. Even if the urine calcium is high, increasing dietary calcium or adding an over the counter calcium supplement with meals should be considered in addition to a low-oxalate diet if the low-oxalate diet alone is insufficient. (See <a href=\"#H723861\" class=\"local\">'High urine oxalate'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If high urine uric acid is present, lifestyle modification to reduce uric acid production may be warranted. If dietary measures are insufficient to lower the urinary uric acid,&nbsp;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a> should be considered. (See <a href=\"#H723868\" class=\"local\">'High urine uric acid'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the urine volume is less than two liters in 24 hours, then patients should increase their fluid intake with the goal of producing at least two liters of urine per day. (See <a href=\"#H729457\" class=\"local\">'Low urine volume'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with stones, radiologic monitoring should be performed initially at one year and, if negative, every two to four years thereafter. (See <a href=\"#H724201\" class=\"local\">'Radiologic monitoring'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-patient-with-established-nephrolithiasis-and-treatment-if-stone-composition-is-unknown/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Kourambas J, Aslan P, Teh CL, et al.
