It is characterized by inflammation of the distal colon in response to one or more food proteins, through a mechanism that does not involve immunoglobulin E (IgE). Cow's milk and soy protein are common triggers. An association of symptoms to food protein antigens requires demonstration of objective improvement following withdrawal of the suspected food antigen, and in some cases, recurrence following a subsequent oral challenge. This disorder will be discussed in this topic review. </p><p>Other disorders of infancy characterized by non-IgE-mediated gastrointestinal inflammatory responses to food are food protein-induced <strong>enterocolitis syndrome</strong> (FPIES), in which the entire gastrointestinal tract is affected and the clinical manifestations are severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], and food protein-induced <strong>enteropathy</strong> in which the small bowel is affected. These disorders are discussed separately.

Guidelines from a panel of experts in allergy and immunology published in 2010 clarified the clinical distinctions and pathophysiologic processes implicated in each of these disorders, and established the classification and terminology used in this topic review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IgE-mediated &ndash; The classical food allergy (food-induced anaphylaxis) is mediated by Ig-E antibodies to food proteins with mast cell activation, and is also termed immediate hypersensitivity. These reactions are rapid in onset, typically beginning within minutes to two hours from the time of ingestion. Signs and symptoms can involve the skin, respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, and cardiovascular system, in isolation or combination. This type of reaction is discussed in separate topic reviews.

One prospective cohort study found that 14 of 22 (64 percent) infants with rectal bleeding had food protein-induced proctocolitis, as determined by biopsy findings from flexible sigmoidoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Five (23 percent) had normal biopsies, and three (14 percent) had nonspecific colitis. However, a separate study confirmed food protein-induced proctocolitis in only 18 percent of infants presenting with rectal bleeding, when milk elimination and challenge was used to make the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>The overall prevalence of food protein-induced proctocolitis is not well-established. In one of the few population-based studies that examined this disorder, the prevalence of rectal bleeding attributed to cow's milk protein was 1.6 per 1000 infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIETARY TRIGGERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cow's milk is the most common trigger in most series. As an example, in a prospective study of 240 exclusively breastfed infants who presented with blood-tinged stools, 88 percent were determined to be sensitive to the following foods, as determined by sequential elimination of foods from the maternal diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cow's milk &ndash; 76 percent.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Egg &ndash; 16 percent.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Soy &ndash; 6 percent.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Corn &ndash; 2 percent (all in infants with multiple protein allergies).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple (two of the above) &ndash; 8 percent.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No response to maternal dietary restriction &ndash; 8 percent; these infants improved after weaning to an extensively hydrolyzed or amino acid-based formula. </p><p/><p>At least one-half of infants with this condition are breastfed; it is somewhat less common in infants fed with cow's milk-based or soy protein-based formulas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy/abstract/9,11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11-14</a>]. It is unclear why an orally ingested protein induces an inflammatory response that is limited to the rectum and distal sigmoid colon. One hypothesis is that the offending protein is bound to antibody in the breast milk until colonic bacterial enzymes cleave or release the antigen. The possibility of an autoimmune mechanism is raised by one study's finding of p-ANCA antibodies in 24 out of 25 of infants with food protein-induced proctocolitis, compared with 0 out of 18 controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Food protein-induced proctocolitis is found almost exclusively in young infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. The disorder typically presents between two and eight weeks of age, although there may be a history of bleeding several weeks prior to diagnosis that may have been erroneously attributed to anal fissures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Presentation as early as the first week of life has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Affected infants are generally healthy but pass blood-tinged stools and mucus, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes are usually present in the stool. Some infants may be fussy or have increased frequency of bowel movements, but frank diarrhea is not typical. Indeed, the parent usually reports that &quot;aside from the diaper,&quot; the child is well. A minority of infants have associated eczema, and a family history of atopic disease is somewhat more common than in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>With complete elimination of the offending protein from the mother's diet or formula, clinical bleeding typically clears within one week. Occasional recurrence of bleeding is common in breastfed infants because of inadvertent maternal intake of small amounts of the triggering protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>A case series describes a similar disorder in toddlers and children, with similar histopathological findings, including eosinophilic infiltration and lymphoid hyperplasia localized to the colon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In these children, sensitivity to cow's milk was established by resolution of symptoms when cow's milk was eliminated from the diet, and recurrence after a milk challenge. One-third of the children in this series had peripheral eosinophilia, and one-quarter had a history of atopy, but none had evidence of immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food allergies. It is not clear whether presentation after the first year of life represents the same disorder as that seen in infants. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnostic evaluation depends primarily on a focused history and physical examination. </p><p>The history should evaluate for typical clinical features of food protein-induced proctocolitis, which include the onset of small or moderate amounts of rectal bleeding in a young infant. If the infant is breastfed, the history should evaluate the mother's diet, including her intake of cow's milk or other dairy products (even small amounts), soy, eggs, and corn. If the infant is fed formula, the history should document the type of formula (ie, standard cow's milk-based formula, soy-based formula, or one of several formulas with extensively hydrolyzed proteins [which are sometimes called &quot;hypoallergenic&quot;]) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F79377\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79377 \">table 2</a>), as well as the history of formula changes and symptomatic responses. </p><p>The physical examination should include a careful inspection of the anus for fissures. The clinician should examine one or more stools directly and perform guaiac testing to confirm the presence of blood. Typical stools in proctocolitis are soft or loose, with blood specks or streaks distributed within the stool, with or without mucous. By contrast, stools that are firm with blood streaks on the outside are more typical of anal fissures. Warning signs that suggest a diagnosis other than food protein-induced proctocolitis include unwell appearance or fever, poor weight gain, frank diarrhea, forceful vomiting, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abdominal distension. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Skin prick testing and in vitro immunoassays for IgE antibodies to foods are <strong>not</strong> recommended for isolated symptoms of proctocolitis. These tests evaluate for the presence of food-specific IgE, and should be negative in food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis. Such testing may be considered if there are factors suggestive of IgE-mediated allergy, such as rashes, vomiting, or acute reactions. IgE-mediated food allergy and the best use of these IgE-mediated tests are presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-food-allergy-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of food allergy: An overview&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of food allergy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Flexible sigmoidoscopic or colonoscopic evaluation usually is reserved for patients with atypical symptoms or those who do not respond to an elimination diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. If flexible sigmoidoscopy is performed in a patient with food protein-induced proctocolitis, gross findings include a mild colitis with patchy erythema and loss of vascularity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy/abstract/7,9,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9,19</a>]. These mucosal changes usually are confined to the rectum, although they occasionally extend proximally. Biopsies typically reveal high numbers of eosinophils (including eosinophilic abscesses) in the lamina propria and muscularis mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Lymphoid nodular hyperplasia is frequently observed in these infants, but it is unclear whether this finding is associated with food protein-induced disease (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lower-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-children-causes-and-diagnostic-approach#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lower gastrointestinal bleeding in children: Causes and diagnostic approach&quot;, section on 'Lymphonodular hyperplasia'</a>). Features that are not typical for food protein-induced proctocolitis include cryptitis, crypt abscesses containing polymorphonuclear abscesses, glandular distortion, and Paneth cell metaplasia; such findings suggest an alternate diagnosis, such as early-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children#H216504648\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease in children&quot;, section on 'Early onset IBD'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18293430\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Food protein-induced proctocolitis is a clinical diagnosis. The condition is suspected in an otherwise healthy infant presenting with small amounts of rectal bleeding. The diagnosis is confirmed after resolution of symptoms upon withdrawal of the presumed food antigen. In one study, fecal calprotectin (a neutrophil-derived protein that is increasingly used as a marker of colonic inflammation) was elevated in infants presenting with proctocolitis, and was used to confirm resolution when it cleared from the feces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The evaluation and empiric elimination diet may be made by the primary care provider, and is also widely practiced by pediatric gastroenterologists. The approach to the elimination diet is described below. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below.) </p><p>Patients with atypical features at presentation, or those who do not respond to a careful and consistent elimination of the suspect food, should undergo a more extensive evaluation. This may include flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy for infants with persistent rectal bleeding; allergy testing for those with food-induced vomiting or other features of immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated disease (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above); or other testing guided by the infant's symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of bloody stools in an infant includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anal fissure &ndash; Anorectal fissures are the most common cause of rectal bleeding in patients younger than one year. They are diagnosed easily by spreading the perineal skin to evert the anal canal.

Term infants who develop NEC typically have a preexisting illness. Overall, 75 percent of cases present within the first month of life. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis in newborns&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intussusception &ndash; Patients with intussusception typically develop episodes of sudden-onset severe, crampy, progressive abdominal pain, accompanied by inconsolable crying and drawing up of the legs toward the abdomen. As symptoms progress, increasing lethargy may develop. It is most common in infants and children between 6 and 36 months of age, and uncommon prior to three months of age. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intussusception-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intussusception in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection &ndash; A number of pathogens can cause lower gastrointestinal bleeding in infants and children, including typical bacterial enteric pathogens and occasionally rotavirus. Infection should be considered in infants presenting with rectal bleeding accompanied by fever, abdominal pain, and tenesmus, particularly if there is a history of exposure to contacts with similar symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lower-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-children-causes-and-diagnostic-approach#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lower gastrointestinal bleeding in children: Causes and diagnostic approach&quot;, section on 'Infectious colitis'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Meckel's diverticulum &ndash; Meckel's diverticulum typically presents as painless rectal bleeding in an otherwise healthy individual. Symptomatic presentation during the neonatal period is rare, described only in a few case reports. In these case reports, it presented as a perforation, intussusception with the diverticulum as a lead point, and in only one case as large-volume painless rectal bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

FPIES may have acute or chronic symptoms, and may include vomiting, diarrhea (with or without blood), and weight loss (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F87555\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87555 \">table 3</a>). Infants with FPIES are generally sicker than those with food protein-induced proctocolitis and enteropathy. The clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and management of FPIES are discussed in detail in a separate topic review.

The diagnosis is suspected based upon the clinical features and should be confirmed by endoscopy with biopsy of the proximal small intestine to confirm villus injury.

Infants with Hirschsprung disease with enterocolitis, or malrotation with volvulus, can have bloody stools as well as marked abdominal distention, vomiting, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other symptoms of obstruction.

Cow's milk should be eliminated first, unless there is good evidence implicating some other specific food. <strong>All</strong> dairy products should be completely eliminated, including butter. All other mammalian milks (eg, goat's and sheep's milk) should also be eliminated because of cross-reactivity between these antigens. For infants with severe symptoms, it may be helpful to accelerate the transition by using an amino acid-based formula rather than breast milk for three to five days, while the mother pumps and discards her breast milk to maintain lactation. </p><p>Successful elimination of foods requires careful reading of labels on everything that is ingested, not just foods in which the ingredient is anticipated to be present. In the United States, nutritional labels on food packages are required to identify eight specified food allergen sources (milk, eggs, fish, crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, and soybeans) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Cow's milk proteins also may be listed as &quot;casein&quot; or &quot;whey&quot; on some processed food labels. Foods that contain lactose as an ingredient are usually safe to consume provided that they do not contain other components of cow's milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In addition, &quot;substitute&quot; foods that are intended to remove fats or other components of a food may not remove the allergenic proteins. As an example, some egg substitutes (which are lower in cholesterol) still contain egg white proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. A referral to a nutritionist can be helpful to provide further information to the mother, and to ensure that her diet includes sufficient calories and other nutrients after eliminating the suspected food antigen.</p><p>The majority of breastfed infants with food protein-induced proctocolitis respond to elimination of cow's milk from the mother's diet; only a few require elimination of multiple proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. After implementation of an elimination diet, most infants will improve within a few days up to two weeks. If the infant's symptoms fail to resolve, then the first step is to review the mother's diet carefully to make sure that all sources of cow's milk protein have been completely eliminated. If cow's milk was completely eliminated for at least two weeks and the infant remains symptomatic, then soy, followed by egg, should also be removed from the mother's diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In the author's clinical practice, there were 27 mothers who chose to continue restricting only cow's milk although their infants had only a partial response to this intervention. All of the infants became asymptomatic by six months of age, and only one had a mild anemia. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7335067\"><span class=\"h2\">Formula-supplemented or -fed infants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For formula-fed infants, cow's milk- or soy-based formulas should be replaced with an extensively hydrolyzed formula (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F79377\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79377 \">table 2</a>). Changing to a soy-based formula is generally not recommended because a substantial percentage of children will be sensitive to both cow's milk and soy proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy/abstract/9,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,26,27</a>]. Of note, many infants will have loose green stools when fed an extensively hydrolyzed formula, and this does not generally indicate ongoing colitis.</p><p>Approximately 5 to 10 percent of infants with cow's milk- or soy-induced proctocolitis do not respond to feeding with an extensively hydrolyzed cow's milk formula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

One study suggests that infants on an extensively hydrolyzed formula recover more rapidly when the formula is supplemented with the probiotic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactobacillus-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lactobacillus</a> GG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Referral to a pediatric gastroenterologist is recommended if the infant fails to improve or the diagnosis is not clear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluating response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Visible bleeding usually improves within 72 hours, but occasionally takes up to two weeks to disappear. Testing of stools for occult blood is not generally necessary in this setting and may confuse the situation because microscopic blood or polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the stool may persist for several weeks.</p><p>Occasional recurrence of bleeding is common in breastfed infants, probably because of inadvertent maternal intake of small amounts of the triggering protein (eg, in meals from restaurants) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. If bleeding recurs, we suggest a careful review of the mother's diet for possible sources of milk or other suspected proteins, before considering progressive dietary restrictions. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Reintroduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For infants who become asymptomatic after elimination of cow's milk (or other suspected antigenic protein), the standard timetable for reintroduction has been at one year of age and is usually successful. Before reintroduction of the protein, stools should be normal and tests for occult blood should be negative. However, expert experience indicates that by six months of age, about 50 percent of breastfed infants will tolerate the resumption of the offending protein; by nine months of age, 95 percent will tolerate resumption of the offending protein in the maternal diet or in formula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Therefore, it may be possible to successfully reintroduce the offending protein into the diet as early as six months of age. The standard approach of introducing the antigenic protein at one year of age has the disadvantage of continuing maternal dietary restriction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a costly extensively hydrolyzed formula. </p><p>Reintroduction of standard cow's milk- or soy-based formula can be done at home, unless the infant presented originally with severe diarrhea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vomiting. Such symptoms suggest concomitant enterocolitis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypersensitivity, in which case, supervision of the food challenge in the physician's office is appropriate. For infants who are breastfeeding, similar parameters can be used to guide reintroduction of these proteins to the mother's diet. Patients receiving an amino acid-based formula may be switched to one containing highly hydrolyzed protein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F79377\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79377 \">table 2</a>) for a few months before trying a formula with whole protein.</p><p>For infants who had moderate or severe symptoms at presentation (eg, bloody diarrhea), we suggest reintroducing the food protein gradually over three to five days, while observing the infant's stools for grossly visible blood or diarrhea. The success of this strategy may not be immediately apparent, since it may take up to three days for the hematochezia to recur after the reintroduction of the protein. The author's personal approach for infants with cow's milk protein-induced proctocolitis is as follows: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Breastfed infants</strong> &ndash; Mother adds one ounce (30 mL) of cow's milk (or dairy equivalent) to her diet, and increases by one ounce each day for five days. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Formula-fed infants</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>First feed &ndash; Add one teaspoon (5 mL) of standard cow's milk-based formula (or unmodified cow's milk if the child is older than one year) to the child's usual hypoallergenic formula. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Second feed &ndash; Substitute one ounce of standard cow's milk formula, instead of one ounce of the usual hypoallergenic formula.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Third feed &ndash; Substitute two ounces (60 mL) of standard cow's milk formula, instead of two ounces of the usual hypoallergenic formula. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This stepwise introduction is continued if tolerated until the full feed consists of the standard cow's milk-based formula or unmodified cow's milk. </p><p/><p>For infants who had mild symptoms at presentation (eg, semi-formed stools with small amounts of visible blood), milk protein can be introduced more rapidly. </p><p>If hematochezia or other symptoms of proctocolitis recur, then we resume the diet restriction for an additional five to six months before attempting to reintroduce the food.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7335074\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of younger siblings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no published data describing the risk of food protein-induced proctocolitis in siblings of an affected infant, but our clinical experience suggests that the risk is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Therefore, we do not suggest avoidance of cow's milk protein for the sibling unless he or she displays symptoms suggestive of protein intolerance. In particular, we feel that mothers should not decline breastfeeding because of these concerns. If the mother chooses to breastfeed, there is no need for dietary restriction if the infant is asymptomatic. For infants who are fed formula, some families choose to use a hydrolyzed formula rather than a cow's milk-based formula, but there is little evidence to support this practice. </p><p>By contrast, if an infant has an IgE-mediated food allergy, younger siblings are thought to be at somewhat increased risk for allergic disease. For those who cannot be exclusively breastfed, feeding with a hydrolyzed formula is recommended. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=milk-allergy-management#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Milk allergy: Management&quot;, section on 'Management of younger siblings'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prognosis is excellent. Nearly all infants will be able to tolerate cow's milk and soy products by one year of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy/abstract/9,14,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,14,30</a>]. Progression to persistent food allergy or chronic colitis including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is extremely rare. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1080259267\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Food protein-induced enteropathy involves similar mechanisms, except that the small bowel is affected. The previously used terms for these non-IgE-mediated disorders, &quot;milk (or soy, etc) protein intolerance,&quot; or &quot;-sensitivity&quot; are no longer recommended. (See <a href=\"#H550522938\" class=\"local\">'Classification and terminology'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Food protein-induced proctocolitis is characterized by blood-tinged stools in an otherwise healthy infant. It is triggered by proteins from cow's milk, or occasionally soy or other foods, which are ingested through breast milk or standard infant formulas. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Dietary triggers'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of food protein-induced proctocolitis is empiric, consisting of complete elimination of cow's milk (or other suspected antigen) from the diet. For breastfed infants, this can be accomplished by eliminating all milk protein from the mother's diet. For formula-fed infants, an extensively hydrolyzed formula is used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F79377\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79377 \">table 2</a>). Only a few infants require elimination of multiple proteins or an amino acid-based formula. The disorder resolves by one year of age in almost all infants. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) and food protein-induced enteropathy are also non-IgE-mediated responses to food, except that they involve the small intestine. FPIES manifests as profuse, repetitive vomiting, often with diarrhea, leading to dehydration and lethargy in the acute setting, or weight loss and failure to thrive in a chronic form.
