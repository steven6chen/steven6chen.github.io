These conditions range in severity from relatively benign disorders that do not impact life span to malignant clonal diseases that progress rapidly. This topic will review the classification of mast cell disorders, provide a brief clinical description of each disorder, and then discuss an approach to the patient suspected of having a mast cell disorder.</p><p>Specific mast cell disorders are discussed in greater detail separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mastocytosis (cutaneous and systemic): Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-evaluation-and-diagnosis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mastocytosis (cutaneous and systemic): Evaluation and diagnosis in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-evaluation-and-diagnosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mastocytosis (cutaneous and systemic): Evaluation and diagnosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-mastocytosis-determining-the-subtype-of-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic mastocytosis: Determining the subtype of disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-mastocytosis-management-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic mastocytosis: Management and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4290513\"><span class=\"h1\">MAST CELL PHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mast cell disorders present with signs and symptoms that are caused either by activation of mast cells or by mast cells infiltrating organs and interfering with normal function. To understand the possible presentations, a brief review of the physiology of mast cells is helpful. Mast cells reside within the connective tissue of all vascularized organs and in mucosal tissues. They are most numerous in the skin and in the mucosal tissues of the respiratory and intestinal tracts. Their numbers and densities are highest at interfaces between the internal and external environments where they act as sentinels and can respond rapidly to foreign organisms, antigens, and toxins. Evolutionarily, mast cells were probably most beneficial in rapid responses to venoms, parasites, and possibly bacterial infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-disorders-an-overview/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>When activated, mast cells release a variety of vasoactive mediators, such as tryptase and histamine, from cytoplasmic granules and membrane lipids within minutes and also generate and release cytokines and chemokines over hours that recruit other inflammatory cells into the involved tissues. These mediators are responsible for many of the signs and symptoms of allergic reactions, including flushing, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, increased vascular permeability, and anaphylaxis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F98373\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98373 \">table 1</a>). Thus, patients with mast cell disorders have signs and symptoms that overlap with those of allergic reactions and allergic diseases, making diagnosis challenging.</p><p>Tryptase is the mast cell mediator that is most useful clinically, although its biologic functions are not fully understood. Although tryptase is released by both mast cells and basophils upon activation, mast cells contain approximately 500-fold more than basophils, and thus, serum tryptase is a relatively specific marker for mast cell activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-disorders-an-overview/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. An acute rise in serum tryptase concentration indicates involvement of mast cells in clinical events, and a persistent elevation in serum tryptase indicates an increase in total body mast cell number. The normal biology of mast cells and the functions of mast cell mediators are reviewed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mast cells: Development, identification, and physiologic roles&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mast-cell-derived-mediators\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mast cell-derived mediators&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mast-cells-surface-receptors-and-signal-transduction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mast cells: Surface receptors and signal transduction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1309754785\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION OF MAST CELL DISORDERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mast cell disorders can be broadly divided into three types: primary, secondary, and idiopathic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F74166\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74166 \">table 2</a>). All of these disorders can present with signs and symptoms caused by widespread activation of mast cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F98373\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98373 \">table 1</a>). However, they differ in severity and involvement of various organ systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-disorders-an-overview/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3980861689\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary mast cell disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary disorders of mast cells are rare. Specific disorders are mastocytosis (both cutaneous and systemic) and monoclonal mast cell activation syndrome (MMAS). Primary mast cell disorders are characterized by clonal populations of mast cells that arise from an affected progenitor and display abnormal genetic and surface markers. The associated molecular defects affect mast cell proliferation or activation pathways.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2668512028\"><span class=\"h3\">Mastocytosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best characterized primary mast cell disorder is mastocytosis. Both systemic and cutaneous forms of the disease exist and both forms can be associated with systemic signs and symptoms due to release of mast cell mediators, so it is difficult to tell from symptoms alone whether the disorder is limited to the skin or systemic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3366387172\"><span class=\"h4\">Systemic mastocytosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic mastocytosis (SM) primarily presents in adults, with a prevalence of 1 per 10,000 to 20,000 in the population (all ages). Abnormal mast cells proliferate and infiltrate the skin, bone marrow, and other organs, leading to a variety of symptoms, physical findings, and abnormalities on routine laboratories (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F91167\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91167 \">table 3</a>). There are several types of SM, ranging from benign to malignant. All are rare. Patients experience episodes of symptoms caused by mast cell-mediator release, which last a few minutes to several hours. Common signs and symptoms include flushing, abdominal cramping, and hypotension. Some patients present with hypotensive reactions to Hymenoptera (eg, wasps, bees) stings, even in the absence of detectable venom-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE), or unexplained recurrent anaphylaxis. Episodes of symptoms may also be triggered by medications (narcotics, opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], iodinated contrast agents), as well as by emotional stress, surgical procedures, and viral illnesses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F70309\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70309 \">table 4</a>).</p><p>The majority (approximately 80 percent) of adult patients with SM demonstrate a characteristic skin finding called urticaria pigmentosa (UP), which is also called maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis (MPCM) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F63025\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63025 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F97908\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97908 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-disorders-an-overview/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A helpful diagnostic clue is Darier's sign, which is the development of urtication (localized swelling and erythema) directly around a lesion of <span class=\"nowrap\">UP/MPCM</span> within a few minutes if it is scratched or stroked. This is due to release of mediators from the mast cells in the lesion. <span class=\"nowrap\">UP/MPCM</span> is unique to mastocytosis. It may be present in both the systemic and cutaneous forms of the disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mastocytosis (cutaneous and systemic): Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An elevation in serum total tryptase in a patient who is in <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> normal state (ie, not during or within a few hours of symptoms) is strongly suggestive of SM. Tryptase is also found elevated after systemic anaphylaxis regardless of mastocytosis. In this case, tryptase measurement should be repeated at least a few days later to see if levels return to the normal range. Persistent tryptase elevations indicate that the total body burden of mast cells is increased, which strongly supports the diagnosis of mastocytosis. Normal levels are between 1 and 11.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (some laboratories consider 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> to be the upper limit of normal). Patients with SM typically demonstrate total serum tryptase at baseline &gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span>. Other causes of an elevated baseline serum tryptase are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-tests-to-support-the-clinical-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory tests to support the clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis&quot;, section on 'Elevations of tryptase in nonanaphylactic patients'</a>.)</p><p>Stem cell factor (SCF) is critical for mast cell growth, differentiation, and survival. The transmembrane receptor for SCF is KIT (encoded by the proto-oncogene kit). More than 90 percent of adult patients with SM have a gain-of-function point mutation (D816V) in exon 17 of kit. This mutation is the only well-characterized molecular defect associated with both increased mast cell numbers in tissues <strong>and</strong> clinical signs and symptoms of mast cell activation. KIT mutations are most readily identified in bone marrow mast cells, and a bone marrow biopsy is usually required to make the diagnosis.</p><p>SM is diagnosed according to major and minor criteria, including characteristic multifocal mast cell aggregates in the bone marrow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F82827\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82827 \">table 5</a>). Evaluation and diagnosis of mastocytosis are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-evaluation-and-diagnosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mastocytosis (cutaneous and systemic): Evaluation and diagnosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H455449839\"><span class=\"h4\">Cutaneous mastocytosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cutaneous mastocytosis (CM) typically presents in infants and young children and usually resolves spontaneously by adolescence. The estimated incidence is less than 1 per 20,000 in the population (all ages). In CM, mast cells accumulate in the skin but not in other organs, although patients may have systemic symptoms due to mast cell mediators diffusing from activated skin mast cells into the circulation. CM in infants and children typically presents with the distinctive skin findings of <span class=\"nowrap\">UP/MPCM</span> (70 to 90 percent of cases). The appearance of <span class=\"nowrap\">UP/MPCM</span> in children is often different from that in adults, with lesions that are more variable in size and shape (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F105581\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105581 \">picture 3</a>). Other forms of CM in children are mastocytomas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F76891\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76891 \">picture 4</a>) and diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis (DCM) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F95683\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef95683 \">picture 5</a>). Children with DCM do not have individually discernible lesions, but rather a diffuse thickening and slight darkening of the skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F103181\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103181 \">picture 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F105584\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105584 \">picture 7</a>). Children with DCM are prone to blistering, severe pruritus, and severe systemic symptoms, such as systemic anaphylaxis, upper and lower gastrointestinal (GI) cramping, diarrhea, gastritis, ulcer disease, and GI bleeding.</p><p/><p>Most children with <span class=\"nowrap\">UP/MPCM</span> and mastocytoma have normal baseline serum tryptase, and any degree of elevation requires further evaluation for systemic disease. Children with DCM may have elevated baseline tryptase even without systemic disease, although persistently elevated or rising tryptase levels should prompt an evaluation for systemic disease. Evaluation and diagnosis of mastocytosis in children is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-evaluation-and-diagnosis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mastocytosis (cutaneous and systemic): Evaluation and diagnosis in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2367015693\"><span class=\"h3\">Monoclonal mast cell activation syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Monoclonal mast cell activation syndrome (MMAS) was first described in 2007 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-disorders-an-overview/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>] and recognized as a distinct primary mast cell disorder by an international consensus conference in the same year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-disorders-an-overview/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. MMAS typically presents in adults with recurrent and episodic symptoms of mast cell activation, such as flushing, abdominal cramping, and hypotension, similar to patients with SM. However, these patients do <strong>not</strong> have <span class=\"nowrap\">UP/MPCM</span> or the characteristic mast cell aggregates in their bone marrow (a major criterion for SM) and have baseline serum tryptase values that are normal or only mildly increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-disorders-an-overview/abstract/7,8,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,10,11</a>].</p><p>Patients with MMAS display one or two minor clonality criteria for SM, but do not fully meet requirements for that diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-disorders-an-overview/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. A clonal population of mast cells in the bone marrow can be demonstrated by the presence of KIT point mutations (most commonly D816V) and aberrant mast cell surface expression of CD25 (alpha chain of the high affinity interleukin-2 [IL-2] receptor, not found on normal mast cells) and, less consistently, CD2 (lymphocyte function antigen-2 [LFA-2]) expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-disorders-an-overview/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, the diagnosis of MMAS can be challenging because these findings may be only detectable in a bone marrow sample enriched for mast cells (rather than in unfractionated bone marrow) or when sensitive diagnostic assays are employed. Thus, referral to a specialty center is often required to make this diagnosis. MMAS is reviewed in detail elsewhere.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3710816565\"><span class=\"h2\">Secondary mast cell activation disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Secondary mast cell activation disorders include classic allergic disorders and other conditions in which mast cells are apparently normal in quantity and function but are responding to an identifiable external stimulus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F74166\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74166 \">table 2</a>). Activating stimuli include allergens, autoantibodies, physical factors, infections, drugs, or products of complement activation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F57791\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57791 \">table 6</a>). Secondary causes of mast cell activation disorders are far more prevalent than primary or idiopathic mast cell disorders. In most cases, clinicians would not think of the above disorders as secondary mast cell activation disorders. However, secondary mast cell activation disorders must be considered and excluded before a primary or idiopathic mast cell disorder can be diagnosed.</p><p>Secondary mast cell activations disorders include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Allergic diseases</strong> &ndash; IgE-mediated allergies to foods, drugs, and a variety of other allergens to which the person is exposed systemically.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Physical forms of urticaria</strong> &ndash; Physical factors that can activate mast cells in susceptible individuals include pressure or vibration on the skin, sudden shifts in temperature, exercise, and exposure to water or ultraviolet (UV) light. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-urticarias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical urticarias&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chronic inflammatory and neoplastic disorders</strong> &ndash; Secondary increases in mast cell numbers causing symptoms (urticaria, angioedema, and or pruritus) and infiltrating affected tissues can be seen in occasional patients with chronic <span class=\"nowrap\">inflammatory/autoimmune</span> disorders (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, pulmonary fibrosis) or neoplastic conditions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Neoplasms sometimes associated with increased mast cells on tissue biopsies include solid tumors (eg, breast cancer), Hodgkin lymphoma, and skin and connective tissue tumors. In addition, aplastic anemia is variably associated with increased expression of SCF, leading to a proliferation of mast cells in the bone marrow. Elevated tryptase levels are seen in some myeloproliferative variants of hypereosinophilic syndromes.</p><p/><p>In secondary mast cell disorders, mast cells in tissue biopsies generally have a mature appearance (round in shape and fully granulated) and lack the spindle shape and surface marker abnormalities found in primary mast cell disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H597144560\"><span class=\"h2\">Idiopathic mast cell disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Idiopathic mast cell disorders are conditions in which mast cell activation occurs, but there is no consistent trigger that accounts for all of the symptoms, and a clonal population of mast cells cannot be demonstrated. This group includes idiopathic anaphylaxis, chronic idiopathic urticaria, and idiopathic angioedema, as well as idiopathic mast cell activation syndrome (IMCAS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F74166\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74166 \">table 2</a>). Mast cell activation may be localized to one tissue (eg, the skin in chronic idiopathic urticaria) or it may be systemic (idiopathic anaphylaxis and IMCAS).</p><p>It is possible that disorders that are classified as idiopathic may ultimately be shown to be primary mast cell disorders in the future if new genetic defects are identified. Alternatively, these disorders may prove to be secondary mast cell disorders for which a mast cell-activating stimulus exists but has not been identified. For example, delayed anaphylaxis to meat ingestion caused by the carbohydrate allergen galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose was probably classified as idiopathic anaphylaxis in many patients until IgE directed against this allergen was identified. Likewise many patients with MMAS were diagnosed with idiopathic anaphylaxis until it was recognized that they had features of a monoclonal mast cell population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-disorders-an-overview/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic urticaria: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, pathogenesis, and natural history&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=idiopathic-anaphylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Idiopathic anaphylaxis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergy-to-meats#H11265525\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergy to meats&quot;, section on 'IgE-mediated reactions'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1096366025\"><span class=\"h3\">Idiopathic mast cell activation syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Idiopathic mast cell activation syndrome (IMCAS) was first proposed as a distinct disorder in 2010 and called mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-disorders-an-overview/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Subsequently, an expert working group expanded the definition of MCAS to also include primary and secondary categories, making &quot;mast cell activation syndrome&quot; essentially an umbrella term that describes a clinical presentation, rather than a specific diagnosis. The specific disorder that used to be MCAS was renamed <strong>idiopathic</strong> MCAS (IMCAS).</p><p>The clinical presentation of IMCAS involves episodes of symptoms due to mast cell-mediator release, which improve in response to therapies that target mast cells and their mediators (eg, antihistamines, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cromolyn-sodium-cromoglicate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cromolyn</a> sodium, antileukotriene agents). Patients with IMCAS lack <span class=\"nowrap\">UP/MPCM</span>. There should be elevations of tryptase in the serum or elevations of mast cell mediators in the urine following episodes of symptoms, which return to normal between episodes. There should be <strong>no</strong> evidence of a pathologic increase in mast cell numbers in the tissues and no mutations in <em>KIT</em>. Provisional diagnostic criteria for this disorder have been defined.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3022187405\"><span class=\"h1\">SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The organ systems most often involved in mast cell disorders are the skin, the mucosae of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and upper and lower respiratory tracts, the cardiovascular system, and the musculoskeletal system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F98373\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98373 \">table 1</a>). The signs and symptoms arise from the ways mast cell mediators affect these organ systems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2547794398\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin and soft tissues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with mast cell disorders often experience flushing, caused by vasodilatory effects of histamine and other mediators. Flushing may be induced by exercise, alcohol, temperature changes, and emotional events. In the author's experience, patients with mast cell disorders develop flushing in association with signs and symptoms in other organ systems, whereas flushing in isolation (eg, the upper neck) is an uncommon presentation and may be due to other causes, such as autonomic dysfunction. The differential diagnosis of flushing is extensive and includes hormonal, neurologic, and cardiovascular etiologies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-disorders-an-overview/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The flushing observed in mast cell disorders is episodic, of longer duration, lasting minutes to a few hours, and usually is not accompanied by sweating, whereas perimenopausal hot flashes usually last two to four minutes and are often accompanied by sweating. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-flushing-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to flushing in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients may also present with pruritus, dermographism, urticaria, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> angioedema, although these symptoms are more characteristic of secondary (such as immunoglobulin E [IgE]-mediated allergic causes) or idiopathic mast cell activation disorders, whereas flushing is prominent in primary mast cell disorders (such as mastocytosis). (See <a href=\"#H1309754785\" class=\"local\">'Classification of mast cell disorders'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2806804842\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastrointestinal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mast cell activation can cause gastrointestinal (GI) complaints, such as intermittent pain, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramping [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-disorders-an-overview/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Heartburn and nausea may be partially caused by gastric acid hypersecretion from parietal cells, which can be stimulated by histamine in patients with increased mast cell burden. Histamine and lipid-derived mast cell mediators (such as leukotrienes) contribute to abdominal pain and diarrhea.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H224036817\"><span class=\"h2\">Respiratory and naso-ocular</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mast cell activation can result in upper and lower airway symptoms, including rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, conjunctival injection and ocular itching, and bronchoconstriction, resulting in shortness of breath and wheezing. Angioedema of the mucosal linings in the upper airways (eg, laryngeal edema) and wheezing are relatively uncommon in primary mast cell disorders and are more characteristic of secondary (eg, allergic) or idiopathic disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1604686669\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiovascular</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic mast cell degranulation can lead to episodic hypotension with resultant lightheadedness and syncope. A compensatory tachycardia is typically associated with the hypotensive event, although other rhythm abnormalities and life-threatening myocardial perfusion abnormalities can be superimposed, especially in patients with coexisting structural or ischemic heart disease. Mast cell disease is thus included in the differential diagnosis of patients with unexplained recurrent syncopal episodes, especially those associated with other symptoms, such as flushing and GI complaints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-disorders-an-overview/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3605825703\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuropsychiatric</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Headache, fatigue, lack of concentration, and mild cognitive problems are frequent complaints in patients with primary and secondary mast cell activation (ie, with mastocytosis, as well as those with allergic disorders). In infants, apneic spells and irritability are seen with extensive cutaneous mastocytosis (CM). These symptoms may be due to the effects of mast cell mediators, medications, or (in adults) psychosomatic effects of having a chronic illness. Of note, neuropsychiatric symptoms should be accompanied by signs and symptoms involving at least two other organ systems if they are to be considered mast cell-related. In isolation, neuropsychiatric symptoms should not prompt an evaluation for mast cell disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4025032937\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sudden, rapid mast cell activation affecting multiple organ systems causes anaphylaxis, and patients with mast cell disorders may present with unexplained anaphylaxis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3576996\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary or idiopathic mast cell disorders are usually considered when patients have symptoms consistent with mast cell activation, such as flushing, urticaria, diarrhea, abdominal cramping, wheezing, syncope, or near-syncope.

In most cases, cutaneous forms of mastocytosis are recognizable by simple inspection of the skin, and skin biopsy is not essential, particularly if the clinician is familiar with the appearance of CM. However, a 3 mm punch biopsy of lesional skin should be performed when the diagnosis of CM is in doubt. Skin biopsy confirms the presence of mast cells in the lesion, but does not provide information about systemic involvement.

An assay for serum total tryptase is available as &quot;ImmunoCAP tryptase&quot; and can be obtained through many commercial laboratories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-disorders-an-overview/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. A &quot;baseline&quot; level (ie, a level when the patient is in <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> usual state of health) should be obtained. Values &gt;11.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> are considered elevated in most diagnostic laboratories. A tryptase level can also be obtained immediately after symptoms to provide evidence that mast cells are responsible for the patient's symptoms. <strong>Increases greater than 1.2 x baseline value + 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> are considered indicative of mast cell activation</strong> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-disorders-an-overview/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. For example, if a patient's baseline total tryptase were 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> a value of 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> or greater drawn within three to four hours of symptoms would represent a significant increase and implicate mast cells as the cause of the patient's symptoms.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tryptase &gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> is seen in many cases of SM when the patient is <strong>in a baseline state</strong>, which is one of the leading ways in which SM is distinguished from other mast cell disorders. If baseline tryptase is elevated on two occasions, an evaluation for SM should be pursued. If the blood was collected <strong>during symptoms</strong>, then another sample should be obtained in a few days when the patient is in a baseline state. Return to a normal level indicates episodes of mast cell activation without an increase in total body mast cells, which suggests mast cell activation, but not mastocytosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Milder baseline elevations or normal baseline tryptase levels may be seen in MMAS and IMCAS. If the serum tryptase is &lt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (ie, mildly elevated or normal) when the patient is at baseline, then a serum tryptase should be drawn during or soon after a future episode of symptoms. It is helpful to provide the patient with a letter to give to providers in urgent care facilities or emergency departments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F109873\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef109873 \">form 1</a>). Serum tryptase should be obtained between 15 minutes and 3 hours after the onset of symptoms. A relative increase in serum total tryptase is indicative of mast cell activation. A detailed discussion about the interpretation of serum tryptase levels is provided separately.

These disorders can generally be diagnosed based on peripheral blood and bone marrow findings and renal function tests. Familial tryptase elevations inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern due to duplications or triplications of alpha tryptase gene have been described; however, it is not clear whether tryptase elevation in these families results from mast cell activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-disorders-an-overview/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The differential diagnosis of an elevated tryptase level is discussed elsewhere.

The diagnosis of anaphylaxis is clinical (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F72225\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72225 \">table 7</a>). Elevations in tryptase following symptoms support the diagnosis, although a normal tryptase does not exclude the possibility of anaphylaxis because some episodes of anaphylaxis (such as those triggered by food allergens) rarely result in elevated tryptase.

All of these disorders can present with signs and symptoms of mast cell activation, but differ in severity and involvement of various organ systems (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F98373\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98373 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1309754785\" class=\"local\">'Classification of mast cell disorders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Primary disorders of mast cells include mastocytosis (both cutaneous and systemic) and monoclonal mast cell activation syndrome (MMAS). All are rare. Primary mast cell disorders are characterized by clonal populations of mast cells that arise from an affected progenitor and display abnormal genetic and surface markers. The associated molecular defects affect mast cell proliferation or activation pathways. (See <a href=\"#H3980861689\" class=\"local\">'Primary mast cell disorders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Secondary mast cell activation disorders are relatively common conditions in which mast cells are normal in quantity and function and are responding to an activating stimulus. Such stimuli include allergens, autoantibodies, physical factors, infections, drugs, or products of complement activation. Examples of secondary mast cell activation disorders include allergies to foods, drugs, and medications, physical urticaria, and, rarely, mast cell activation disorders associated with autoimmune disorders or malignancies. (See <a href=\"#H3710816565\" class=\"local\">'Secondary mast cell activation disorders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Idiopathic mast cell disorders are conditions in which mast cell activation occurs, but there is no consistent trigger that accounts for all of the symptoms, and a clonal population of mast cells cannot be demonstrated. This group includes idiopathic anaphylaxis, chronic idiopathic urticaria, and idiopathic angioedema, as well as idiopathic mast cell activation syndrome (IMCAS). (See <a href=\"#H597144560\" class=\"local\">'Idiopathic mast cell disorders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The organ systems most often involved in mast cell disorders are the skin, the mucosae of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and respiratory (upper and lower) tracts, and the cardiovascular system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F98373\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98373 \">table 1</a>). Common signs and symptoms of mast cell activation include flushing, urticaria, diarrhea, wheezing, fatigue, or syncope or near-syncope due to hypoperfusion of the brain.

Tryptase is persistently elevated (usually &gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> in systemic mastocytosis (SM), and milder elevations are variably seen in other mast cell disorders and in some cases of diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis (DCM) in infants and children. In patients with a normal tryptase at baseline, the demonstration of transient elevations of tryptase immediately after symptoms is important in proving that mast cell activation is the cause of the patient's symptoms.
