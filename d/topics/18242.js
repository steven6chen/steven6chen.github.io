It is an obstetrical emergency because the prolapsed cord is vulnerable to compression, umbilical vein occlusion, and umbilical artery vasospasm, which can compromise fetal oxygenation. In occult umbilical cord prolapse, the cord slips alongside, but not ahead of, the presenting part. The occult prolapsed cord is also vulnerable to compression and its sequelae. Membranes are usually ruptured in both settings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">FREQUENCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Umbilical cord prolapse occurred in 0.16 to 0.18 percent of live born deliveries in three large series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-prolapse/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>], the rate may be slowly declining [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-prolapse/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1072309092\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of umbilical cord prolapse is not always clear. One probable mechanism is high outward flow of amniotic fluid at rupture of membranes that carries the umbilical cord past an unengaged fetal presenting part. Another probable mechanism is disengagement of the presenting part during obstetric procedures, allowing the cord to prolapse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Umbilical cord prolapse primarily occurs in two settings: (1) when the presenting part does not adequately fill the pelvis because of maternal or fetal characteristics, and (2) when obstetric interventions are performed that dislodge the presenting part. Although observational studies suggest that obstetric interventions increase the risk of cord prolapse, it is often difficult to determine whether cord prolapse would have occurred spontaneously if the intervention had not been performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-prolapse/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Fetal and maternal factors that have been associated with cord prolapse include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malpresentation (breech, transverse, oblique, or unstable lie)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prematurity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low birth weight</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Second twin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low lying placentation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pelvic deformities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uterine <span class=\"nowrap\">malformations/tumors</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>External fetal anomalies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiparity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polyhydramnios</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long umbilical cord</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unengaged presenting part</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolonged labor</p><p/><p>Obstetric interventions account for about 50 percent of cases of cord prolapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-prolapse/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

In one review, the overall frequency of cord prolapse in vertex, breech, and transverse lies was 0.24, 3.5, and 9.6 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-prolapse/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Footling breech presentation carries a higher risk of cord prolapse than other types of breech presentation. Nevertheless, most cord prolapses occur with vertex presentations because of the relatively low incidence of noncephalic presentations.</p><p>Infants delivering prematurely have a higher rate of cord prolapse, probably due to the smaller size of the fetus relative to the amniotic fluid volume and the increased frequency of malpresentation among premature fetuses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-prolapse/abstract/9,11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11,13</a>].</p><p>The excess risk of cord prolapse in twin gestation is confined to the nonpresenting twin, in whom malpresentation is more common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-prolapse/abstract/9,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13-15</a>].</p><p>Cord prolapse in multiparous women may be related to the increased likelihood of rupture of membranes prior to engagement of the presenting part, since engagement in multiparas often occurs after labor has begun and later than in nulliparas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-prolapse/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In one report of 30 patients with cord prolapse, two-thirds of the women were para six or more and one patient experienced cord prolapse in two successive deliveries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-prolapse/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Polyhydramnios is often associated with an unstable lie or unengaged presenting part, as well as copious flow of amniotic fluid after membrane rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-prolapse/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]; all of these factors increase the risk of cord prolapse.</p><p>In the general obstetric population, routine amniotomy for labor augmentation did not significantly increase the risk of cord prolapse compared with no amniotomy in a meta-analysis of randomized trials (relative risk 1.00, 95% CI 0.14-7.10; two trials, n = 1615); however, the wide confidence level suggests a possible effect cannot be excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-prolapse/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cord prolapse usually presents with the abrupt onset of severe, prolonged fetal bradycardia or moderate to severe variable decelerations in a patient with a previously normal tracing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-prolapse/abstract/5,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9</a>]. The fetal heart rate changes typically occur soon after membrane rupture or an obstetric intervention that dislodges the presenting part. Less commonly, the care provider may palpate a pulsating cord incidentally on a vaginal examination performed to assess labor progress or a patient with ruptured membranes may report seeing or feeling an overt cord prolapse.</p><p>In one series, mean cervical dilation at the time of cord prolapse was 5.8 cm and mean station was -1.6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-prolapse/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1040360363\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of overt umbilical cord prolapse is based on visualization or palpation of the umbilical cord ahead of the presenting part.</p><p>The diagnosis of occult umbilical cord prolapse is based on the abrupt onset of severe, prolonged fetal bradycardia or moderate to severe variable decelerations in a patient with a previously normal tracing. The diagnosis is supported by the presence of risk factors for prolapse (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above) and may or may not be confirmed at cesarean delivery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fetal heart rate changes suggestive of occult cord prolapse can also be caused by a fall in maternal blood pressure, tachysystole, placental abruption, uterine rupture, and vasa previa.</p><p>The clinical setting helps to distinguish these disorders from an occult prolapse. Fetal bradycardia following injection of an epidural anesthetic suggests a fall in maternal blood pressure as the cause. This diagnosis is supported by normalization of the fetal heart rate in response to maternal intravenous fluid infusion and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenylephrine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ephedrine-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ephedrine</a> administration.</p><p>Placental abruption, uterine rupture, and vasa previa are usually accompanied by vaginal bleeding, and abruption and rupture are often painful in the absence of labor anesthesia, which distinguishes these disorders from occult prolapse. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placental abruption: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-rupture-after-previous-cesarean-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine rupture after previous cesarean delivery&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rupture-of-the-unscarred-uterus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rupture of the unscarred uterus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Velamentous umbilical cord insertion and vasa previa&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Tachysystole is defined by the presence of more than 5 contractions in 10 minutes averaged over a 30-minute window and typically occurs in women receiving uterotonic drugs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF INTRAPARTUM CORD PROLAPSE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1040360478\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal obstetric management of acute cord prolapse is prompt delivery to avoid fetal compromise or death from compression of the cord between the presenting fetal part and the birth canal. There are no data from prospective or randomized studies on which to base management recommendations because of the infrequent and urgent nature of this problem. When an acute overt cord prolapse is detected or occult prolapse is suspected, a clinically practical approach includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Call for assistance and prepare for emergency delivery</strong> &ndash; Nursing, anesthesia, obstetric, operating room, and pediatric providers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Initiate maneuvers for intrauterine resuscitation</strong> &ndash; These maneuvers are primarily targeted to moving the fetus off of the cord. (See <a href=\"#H1942694\" class=\"local\">'Intrauterine resuscitation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Monitor the fetal heart rate </strong>to determine whether resuscitative interventions are effective, which impacts the urgency of delivery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>If the prolapse is overt:</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Minimize manipulating an overtly prolapsed cord and avoid exposing it to the cold environment</strong>, which may exacerbate poor perfusion by inducing spasm of the umbilical artery. Replace an overtly prolapsed cord in the vagina and keep it moist with wet gauze.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Perform emergency delivery by the most rapid and safe route, which is typically cesarean</strong> &ndash; Assisted vaginal delivery may be considered in select situations when, in the clinician's judgment, the fetus can be delivered safely and as quickly, or more quickly, than by cesarean. Some examples include prolapse at full dilation with breech presentation or prolapse after birth of the first twin. In a population-based analysis of birth certificate data from over 16,000 deliveries complicated by cord prolapse and over 10 million controls, cesarean delivery was associated with a higher risk of fetal injury than vaginal delivery (18.5 versus 8.7 percent; adjusted odds ratio 2.6, 95% CI 2.3-2.9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-prolapse/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Analysis of information in birth certificates is limited because of missing, incomplete, and inaccurate information. Furthermore, it was not possible to determine what factors lead to the decision to attempt vaginal delivery versus immediate cesarean delivery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">The type of anesthesia (neuraxial versus general) depends on whether a neuraxial catheter is already in place and will provide an adequate anesthetic level for delivery anesthesia and the urgency of delivery (ie, whether category III tracing persists or improves with intrauterine resuscitation maneuvers).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">If the fetal heart rate is present prior to moving to the operating room, we do not pause to recheck it before surgery as we would perform emergency cesarean regardless of the findings and attempt neonatal resuscitation, if required.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Management of cord prolapse is an excellent area for simulation drills to educate providers, facilitate communication techniques, and identify unit-specific barriers to emergency delivery. Team training can significantly lower the time from diagnosis to delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-prolapse/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>If the prolapse is occult:</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Resuscitative maneuvers may lead to a category I or II tracing due to resolution of the occult prolapse or because an alternative diagnosis was responsible for the category III tracing. We would base the decision to proceed with an emergent delivery on the FHR tracing. If resuscitation ameliorates the concerning characteristics, it is acceptable to revert to expectant management.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1942694\"><span class=\"h2\">Intrauterine resuscitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following maneuvers can be helpful for reducing pressure on the cord before delivery. In the absence of comparative studies, there is no strong evidence that one maneuver is better than another or that combinations of maneuvers are more successful. It is reasonable to attempt all of the maneuvers until the fetal heart rate pattern improves to category I or II.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Manually elevate the presenting part</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Manual elevation of the presenting part is the most common intervention for managing cord prolapse, and the maneuver we prefer because it is fast, does not require special equipment, and has been effective in large series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-prolapse/abstract/13,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,20</a>]. While preparations for an emergency cesarean delivery are made, the clinician places <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> hand in the vagina and gently elevates the fetal head so it is not compressing the cord. Although effective, a prolonged period of manual elevation can be difficult for the clinician and the patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1040362136\"><span class=\"h3\">Place patient in Trendelenburg or knee chest position</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Attempt to elevate the fetal head manually to decompress the cord. Placing the patient in steep Trendelenburg or the knee-chest position may change the relationship between the fetus and umbilical cord and thereby alleviate cord compression.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1942733\"><span class=\"h3\">Retrofill the bladder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retrofilling the bladder rapidly with 500 to 700 milliliters of saline via a bladder catheter distends the bladder, which may gently elevate the presenting part [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-prolapse/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Bladder filling may be particularly useful as a temporizing measure when cesarean delivery cannot be performed urgently. A review of 187 cases of cord prolapse managed by retrofilling the bladder with or without adjunctive tocolysis reported only one perinatal death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-prolapse/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1040361985\"><span class=\"h3\">Administer a tocolytic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A rapidly acting tocolytic can be administered to reduce pressure on the cord from uterine contractions. In one report of 51 cases of cord prolapse, the use of both bladder filling and a tocolytic drug appeared to be beneficial: there were no fetal or neonatal deaths despite a mean interval from diagnosis to delivery of 35 minutes; the majority of infants had Apgar scores &ge;7 at five minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-prolapse/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Consider manually replacing the prolapsed cord</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Manual replacement of the cord (funic reduction) is a controversial resuscitative maneuver because the procedure appeared to be associated with an increase in intrapartum asphyxia and demise in the era before continuous fetal monitoring became available; however, a more recent small case series reported five successful vaginal deliveries 14 to 512 minutes after funic reduction without anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-prolapse/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>After the fetal head is elevated with gentle suprapubic pressure or transvaginally or both, the cord is slipped over the widest part of the head and placed in the nuchal area. The head is then gently returned to its original position in the birth canal to decrease the chance of creating an oblique or transverse lie. Close attention to the fetal heart rate is required if attempting this maneuver, particularly if it is in the attempted vaginal delivery of a second twin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1040361933\"><span class=\"h2\">Special situations</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2921508235\"><span class=\"h2\">Prolapse on an antepartum unit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management is the same as described above when prolapse occurs on an antepartum unit. However, we do not perform an emergency cesarean delivery if there is no fetal heart rate as successful neonatal resuscitation is not possible after a prolonged period of asystole.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1040362065\"><span class=\"h3\">Pre-hospital cord prolapse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Umbilical cord prolapse may occur with premature rupture of membranes outside of the hospital or during planned home birth. Women with an overt cord prolapse should call for help and assume the knee-chest face-down position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-prolapse/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] or lie on the floor with pillows to elevate the hips above the heart while waiting for an ambulance for hospital transfer. During ambulance transfer, however, the knee-chest position is potentially unsafe for the mother so a left lateral position is advised, with pillows under the hip. If possible, the presenting part should be elevated manually or by bladder distension during the transfer, as described above. (See <a href=\"#H1942694\" class=\"local\">'Intrauterine resuscitation'</a> above.)</p><p>A report from the Netherlands of umbilical cord prolapse occurring at home identified six cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-prolapse/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Three cases involved a planned home birth with a midwife in attendance; the other three cases were self-diagnosed when the cord prolapsed outside the vagina after prelabor spontaneous rupture of membranes. The diagnosis-to-delivery interval ranged from 31 to 72 minutes. All of the infants were live born, but one subsequently died of asphyxia. This was a self-diagnosed case managed with manual elevation and bladder filling in the ambulance and diagnosis to cesarean delivery time of 47 minutes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1291971465\"><span class=\"h3\">Previable gestational age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Only a few case reports have described conservative management of ruptured membranes and overt cord prolapse at a previable gestational age. All four mothers were placed in Trendelenburg and, in one case, the cord was manually replaced in the vagina several times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-prolapse/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Delivery occurred 3.5 days to three weeks after cord prolapse, with one neonatal death and three live births who were ultimately discharged home. These cases were likely reported because of the rarity of conservative management and good outcomes in this setting. Conservative management places the mother at risk of serious infection, may not prevent perinatal death, and may result in the delivery of a child who is severely disabled. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=periviable-birth-limit-of-viability\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Periviable birth (Limit of viability)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reported perinatal mortality related to cord prolapse varies widely, from 0 to 3 percent for events occurring among patients monitored on a labor and delivery unit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-prolapse/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Asphyxia and complications related to prematurity and congenital anomalies are the major causes of poor outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-prolapse/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Compression of umbilical vessels interferes with fetal oxygenation; thus the degree of cord compression, the interval between cord prolapse and delivery, and successful use of intrauterine resuscitation maneuvers all impact the risk of asphyxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-prolapse/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Intact outcomes have been reported with long diagnosis to delivery intervals, presumably because umbilical blood flow was sufficient despite prolapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-prolapse/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Another factor is that some cords (eg, non-coiled) may be more vulnerable to cord compression than others. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gross-examination-of-the-placenta#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gross examination of the placenta&quot;, section on 'Coiling'</a>.)</p><p>Cord prolapse occurring outside of the hospital setting has a poor prognosis. In one series, 3 of the 7 prolapses before hospital admission resulted in <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/neonatal</span> death compared with 0 deaths among the 70 in-hospital occurrences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-prolapse/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In a review of large series, cord prolapse occurring outside of the hospital was associated with perinatal mortality rates of 38 to 44 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-prolapse/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>There are sparse data on the long-term outcome of children whose birth was complicated by cord prolapse. In a series of 132 cases of cord prolapse, only 1 of 120 survivors had a long-term handicap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-prolapse/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A study of risk factors for cerebral palsy identified 110 children with cerebral palsy among 16,785 cases of cord prolapse or 1 case of cerebral palsy per 153 cord prolapses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-prolapse/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTICIPATION AND PREVENTION OF CORD PROLAPSE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H77327643\"><span class=\"h2\">Anticipating and managing risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound examination for detection of cord prolapse are unclear and most cord prolapses occur in women without antepartum sonographic evidence of funic presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-prolapse/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Therefore, we do not screen all pregnant women near delivery with ultrasound to assess umbilical cord position. Ultrasound examination is reasonable when there is a clinical concern of funic presentation (eg, malpresentation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-prolapse/abstract/30,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,32,33</a>]. Color flow Doppler studies can clarify cord position if there is uncertainty on real-time sonographic examination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65216%7EOBGYN%2F79970%7EOBGYN%2F59220\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef65216 graphicRef79970 graphicRef59220 \">image 1A-C</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-prolapse/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Transvaginal imaging may be necessary if visualization is limited transabdominally. (See <a href=\"#H77327882\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancies with funic presentation'</a> below.)</p><p>Risk factors for cord prolapse are generally not modifiable, but awareness of patients at high risk may help facilitate prompt diagnosis and delivery when prolapse occurs. For example, cord prolapse should be excluded by vaginal examination after spontaneous rupture of membranes in women with risk factors for prolapse or with fetal heart rate decelerations. We admit all nonlaboring women with prematurely ruptured membranes to the labor floor and continuously monitor the fetal heart rate to check for fetal heart rate decelerations. On the antepartum unit, we perform intermittent fetal heart rate monitoring to check for fetal heart rate decelerations and educate patients about the signs and symptoms of cord prolapse.</p><p>We do not electively hospitalize most women with malpresentation, but educate them about the signs, symptoms, and management of cord prolapse and instruct them to call their provider upon spontaneous rupture of membranes or the onset of labor. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists suggests advising women in the community with transverse, oblique or unstable lie to present to the hospital urgently when they begin labor or rupture membranes and suggests discussing elective hospital admission with patients after 37<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">0/7ths</sup></span> weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-prolapse/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H77327882\"><span class=\"h3\">Pregnancies with funic presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When funic presentation is identified as an incidental finding antepartum, we perform follow-up evaluation of cord location to help with labor and delivery planning. In a series of 13 patients identified as having funic presentation on a third trimester ultrasound, six had cord prolapse at the time of delivery and underwent cesarean, in one case following cord prolapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-prolapse/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The other seven fetuses had uncomplicated vaginal deliveries.</p><p>There are no high-quality data on which to base a strong recommendation for or against scheduled cesarean delivery when funic presentation is noted in a non-laboring woman with cephalic presentation at term. The authors attempt to deliver these women vaginally, but scheduled cesarean delivery is also a common practice in this setting.</p><p>Patients with a floating vertex, cervical dilation (&gt;2 cm), and persistent funic presentation after 39 weeks of gestation are at high risk of cord prolapse with rupture of membranes; polyhydramnios augments this risk. These women are unlikely to benefit from expectant management at this gestational age. The authors offer these women induction of labor by &ldquo;needling&rdquo; the membranes in a controlled environment, with the anesthesia team ready for an emergency cesarean delivery in the event of cord prolapse.</p><p>For less high-risk patients with a funic presentation that has not resolved before labor at term, the authors advise coming to labor and delivery as soon as labor begins so that the cord position can be evaluated, usually by physical examination. If physical examination is inconclusive, transvaginal ultrasound with color <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> power Doppler will clarify the diagnosis. If the funic presentation has resolved, the patient should continue to labor with a goal of vaginal delivery, unless there are other indications for cesarean delivery. If the funic presentation is confirmed, we monitor the <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/fetal</span> heart rate continuously and perform a controlled amniotomy (see <a href=\"#H77327611\" class=\"local\">'Minimizing risk from obstetric maneuvers'</a> below), with the anesthesia team ready for an emergency cesarean delivery in the event of cord prolapse. Cesarean delivery without a trial of labor is also reasonable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H77327611\"><span class=\"h2\">Minimizing risk from obstetric maneuvers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Identifying patients at risk for cord prolapse and avoiding unnecessary obstetric interventions in these patients may prevent some cases of prolapse. However, obstetric interventions are often indicated and cannot be avoided. Anticipation of prolapse and modification in standard techniques can reduce the risk of prolapse in these cases.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If possible, perform amniotomy only when the vertex is well applied to the cervix. When the vertex is not well applied and amniotomy is necessary, &ldquo;controlled amniotomy&rdquo; with either a fetal scalp electrode, 22-gauge spinal needle, or small angiocatheter with the needle removed and simultaneous application of fundal pressure may decrease the risk of prolapse. In pregnancies with hydramnios or an unengaged presenting part, we use a small gauge needle to puncture fetal membranes in one or more places in the operating room. This &quot;controlled amniotomy&quot; minimizes the risk of gushing amniotic fluid and enables emergency cesarean delivery in the event of cord prolapse. In one series of 37 patients with cord prolapse during delivery, iatrogenic rupture of membranes accounted for 23 (62 percent) cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/umbilical-cord-prolapse/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid disengaging the fetal presenting part when performing procedures such as application of a fetal internal scalp electrode, intrauterine pressure catheter insertion, fetal scalp sampling, amnioinfusion, forceps application, and manual rotation of the fetal head.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H308762783\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Frequency'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Outcome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors for cord prolapse include (1) fetomaternal factors that lead to inadequate filling of the maternal pelvis by the fetus and (2) iatrogenic obstetric interventions, but many prolapses occur without antecedent risk factors. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first sign of cord prolapse is usually severe, prolonged fetal bradycardia or moderate to severe variable decelerations after a previously normal tracing. The prolapse may be overt or occult. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Standard obstetrical management of cord prolapse is prompt cesarean delivery to avoid fetal compromise or death from compression of the cord. However, vaginal delivery may be a reasonable option in select cases when delivery is imminent and can be safely assisted. (See <a href=\"#H1040360478\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intrauterine resuscitation using maneuvers such as elevation of the presenting part manually or by retrofilling the bladder, placing the patient in Trendelenburg or knee chest position, and administering a tocolytic may reduce pressure on the cord while preparations are being made for delivery. (See <a href=\"#H1942694\" class=\"local\">'Intrauterine resuscitation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reported perinatal mortality related to cord prolapse varies widely, from 0 to 3 percent for events occurring among patients monitored on a labor and delivery unit. Asphyxia and complications related to prematurity and congenital anomalies are the major causes of poor outcome. The degree of cord compression, the interval between cord prolapse and delivery, and successful use of intrauterine resuscitation maneuvers all impact the risk of asphyxia. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Outcome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Awareness of patients at high risk of prolapse may help facilitate prompt diagnosis and delivery when prolapse occurs. For example, cord prolapse should be excluded by vaginal examination after spontaneous rupture of membranes in women with risk factors for prolapse or with fetal heart rate decelerations. (See <a href=\"#H77327643\" class=\"local\">'Anticipating and managing risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with transverse, oblique, or unstable lie should present to the hospital urgently when they begin labor or rupture membranes. (See <a href=\"#H77327643\" class=\"local\">'Anticipating and managing risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In high-risk patients, the risk of cord prolapse may be reduced by minimizing use of obstetric interventions that may disengage the presenting part and by performing controlled amniotomy. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Anticipation and prevention of cord prolapse'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We do not routinely perform ultrasound examinations to assess umbilical cord position near term, but would order an ultrasound examination to confirm cord position when there is a clinical suspicion of funic presentation. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Anticipation and prevention of cord prolapse'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a funic presentation that has not resolved before labor at term, management depends on the risk of cord prolapse. (See <a href=\"#H77327882\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancies with funic presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with a floating vertex, cervical dilation &gt;2 cm, and persistent funic presentation at &ge;39 weeks are at very high risk of cord prolapse with rupture of membranes and unlikely to benefit from expectant management, especially if polyhydramnios is present. The authors offer these women induction of labor by &quot;needling&quot; the membranes in a controlled environment, with the anesthesia team ready for an emergency cesarean delivery in the event of cord prolapse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients in whom the vertex has descended, the cervix is not significantly dilated, and amniotic fluid volume is normal are at increased risk of cord prolapse, but not the highest risk group. The authors advise these women to come to labor and delivery as soon as labor begins so that the cord position can be evaluated. The patient can continue to labor with a goal of vaginal delivery if the funic presentation has resolved. If the funic presentation is confirmed, we monitor the <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/fetal</span> heart rate continuously and perform a controlled amniotomy, with the anesthesia team ready for an emergency cesarean delivery in the event of cord prolapse.
