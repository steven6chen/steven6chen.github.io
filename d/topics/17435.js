While these exposures rarely result in clinically significant poisoning, it is important for healthcare providers to be aware of the limited number of plants that have the potential to cause serious clinical effects. Most young children are asymptomatic or have minimal gastrointestinal toxicity after exploratory plant ingestions (eg, picking berries off a bush). Serious poisoning is associated with large ingestions of highly toxic plant species (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69016\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69016 \">table 1</a>), which typically occurs in the setting of suicidal ingestion, foraging mistakes, or intentional recreational use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3216162\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH AND DISPOSITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient management and disposition after ingestion of a potentially toxic plant depends upon the plant ingested, the amount ingested, and the clinical findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymptomatic children with small ingestions of confirmed nontoxic or minimally toxic plant species (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52103\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52103 \">table 2</a>) do not require any treatment unless significant symptoms develop. (See <a href=\"#H38616864\" class=\"local\">'Mucosal irritation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H38616840\" class=\"local\">'Gastroenteritis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymptomatic children with ingestions of unknown or potentially highly toxic plants (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69016\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69016 \">table 1</a>), particularly consumption of large amounts, should receive medical evaluation, gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal if accomplished within one hour, and observation for four to six hours. In most instances, the child will remain asymptomatic and be discharged home. (See <a href=\"#H38616906\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal decontamination'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic patients with ingestions of highly toxic plants (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69016\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69016 \">table 1</a>) should receive timely supportive care, gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal if accomplished within one hour of ingestion, and for plant ingestion other than those that cause mucosal irritation (eg, philodendron, dieffenbachia [dumbcane]), antidotal therapy if necessary, and hospital admission. In addition to medical management, patients who ingest highly toxic plants with suicidal intent or for recreational purposes warrant evaluation for mental illness or drug abuse. (See <a href=\"#H38616832\" class=\"local\">'Supportive care'</a> below and <a href=\"#H38616906\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal decontamination'</a> below and <a href=\"#H38616914\" class=\"local\">'Antidotes'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H38616832\"><span class=\"h1\">SUPPORTIVE CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment recommendations for children with toxic plant ingestion are primarily derived from case series and reports and are based upon physical findings. Many exploratory plant ingestions in young children ultimately involve consumption of nontoxic species that require <strong>no therapy</strong> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52103\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52103 \">table 2</a>). Gastrointestinal irritation is the most common clinical effect associated with toxic plant ingestion in children and is typically self-limited. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potentially-toxic-plant-ingestions-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation#H6473972\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Potentially toxic plant ingestions in children: Clinical manifestations and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Nontoxic'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potentially-toxic-plant-ingestions-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation#H7184699\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Potentially toxic plant ingestions in children: Clinical manifestations and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Minor gastrointestinal irritation'</a>.)</p><p>Clinical findings and identification of the ingested plant are helpful in determining specific management. A regional poison control center should be contacted to assist with likely plant species ingested based upon clinical findings, identification of any available plant material, and treatment of specific toxic effects. Most poison control centers maintain active call lists of botanists who are knowledgeable concerning local prevalence of plant species and can assist in identification. To obtain emergent consultation with a medical toxicologist, call the United States Poison Control Network at 1-800-222-1222, or access the World Health Organization's list of international poison centers (<a href=\"http://www.who.int/gho/phe/chemical_safety/poisons_centres/en/index.html&amp;token=vYXClxsD0hnrf4M8kYcoD1kMICrGjKQRRaFc8pA0pw9qlhpVmsmYh2e3Gi7webw9H9uSzH3nipQ0rPpTLYBWhGP+/wpQqUegRzvggwgKA6s=&amp;TOPIC_ID=16521\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.who.int/gho/phe/chemical_safety/poisons_centres/en/index.html</a>).</p><p>In patients who have ingested highly toxic plants (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69016\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69016 \">table 1</a>) or who present with signs of serious toxicity, the clinician should rapidly perform an initial assessment of clinical findings and support airway, breathing, and circulation as needed. Antidotes are often necessary in symptomatic children who have ingested plants that cause anticholinergic, cardiac glycoside, or cyanide poisoning.
