It also often causes silver or white scales to form on the skin. Doctors do not know what causes psoriasis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H542578193\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of psoriasis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms of psoriasis can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Areas of skin that are dry or red, and that are usually covered with silvery or white scales (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F90334\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90334 \">picture 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rashes on the scalp, genitals, or in skin folds (like the folds you have at the elbow)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Itching</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nail changes that make the fingernails or toenails look pitted, crumbly, or different in color (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F90363%7EPI%2F90364\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90363 graphicRef90364 \">picture 2A-B</a>)</p><p/><p>Psoriasis has an emotional effect, too. People with the condition often feel embarrassed by their skin, and some get depressed or anxious. If you have these problems, mention them to your doctor or nurse. You might feel better with counseling or another type of mental health treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H542578200\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for psoriasis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have psoriasis by looking at your skin and by asking you questions. In rare cases, doctors take a small sample of skin to check if psoriasis is the problem.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H542578207\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to reduce my symptoms?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use unscented thick moisturizing creams and ointments to keep the skin from getting too dry.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H542578214\"><span class=\"h1\">How is psoriasis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are treatments that can relieve the symptoms of psoriasis. But the condition cannot be cured.</p><p>Treatments for psoriasis come in creams and ointments, pills, or shots. There is also a form of light therapy that can help with psoriasis. All treatments for psoriasis work by slowing the growth of skin, controlling the immune response that causes psoriasis, or both. Most people need to try different treatments or combinations of treatments before they figure out what works best. The medicines that are used most often are called steroids. These medicines are applied to the skin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H542578221\"><span class=\"h1\">What is psoriatic arthritis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psoriatic arthritis is a form of arthritis that can affect some people with psoriasis. It causes pain and swelling in the joints.</p><p>People with psoriatic arthritis can take medicines to reduce pain and swelling. Exercise and physical therapy can also help. Plus, some of the same medicines that help with the skin problems caused by psoriasis also help with psoriatic arthritis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H542578228\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=eczema-atopic-dermatitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Eczema (atopic dermatitis) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=psoriatic-arthritis-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Psoriatic arthritis in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=psoriatic-arthritis-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Psoriatic arthritis in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=topical-corticosteroid-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Topical corticosteroid medicines (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=psoriasis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Psoriasis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=psoriatic-arthritis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Psoriatic arthritis (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
