However, some children develop chronic OME, defined as OME that persists for three months or longer. Patients with chronic OME may have problems related to the associated, often fluctuating, conductive hearing loss. Rarely, the chronic eustachian tube dysfunction that results in OME persists for years, and the patient may develop long-term problems due to tympanic membrane retraction, ossicular erosion, persistent tympanic membrane perforation, or cholesteatoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Otitis media with effusion (serous otitis media) in children: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Complications and sequelae'</a>.)</p><p>The goals of management are to eliminate the middle ear fluid, restore normal hearing, and, when feasible, prevent future episodes. The primary management options are &quot;watchful waiting&quot; versus myringotomy with tympanostomy tube (ventilation tube, grommet) placement. Which option is undertaken, and when, depends upon comorbid conditions that increase the impact of conductive hearing loss on speech, language, or learning problems; the severity of OME-associated hearing loss; the duration of the effusion; and whether it is unilateral or bilateral (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F117272\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef117272 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-management/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. When all factors are considered, the balance of risks and benefits will favor watchful waiting for most children and placement of tympanostomy tubes in some. (See <a href=\"#H377254982\" class=\"local\">'Watchful waiting'</a> below and <a href=\"#H170941175\" class=\"local\">'Tympanostomy tubes'</a> below.)</p><p>The recommendations provided in this topic review are generally consistent with those of professional society guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-management/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H377255892\"><span class=\"h2\">At-risk children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>&quot;At-risk&quot; children are those who have or are at risk for speech, language, or learning problems. This includes children with hearing loss independent of OME, neurodevelopmental disorders (eg, Down syndrome, autism spectrum disorder), craniofacial abnormalities (eg, cleft palate), and uncorrectable visual impairment (who depend on hearing more than children with normal vision) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-management/abstract/1,2,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,7</a>].</p><p>Children with OME who have, or are at risk for, speech, language, or learning disorders should undergo hearing evaluation at the time of diagnosis of OME [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The conductive hearing loss associated with OME is thought to have a more significant impact in children with disabilities. The type of testing depends upon the age of the child and his or her ability to cooperate with testing. Children in whom there is concern for speech delay should be referred for speech and language evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hearing-impairment-in-children-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hearing impairment in children: Evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of speech and language disorders in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We agree with professional society recommendations for early surgical referral (ie, within three months) for children with OME who are at risk for speech, language, or learning problems (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F117272\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef117272 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-management/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>]. At-risk children typically have been excluded from studies evaluating the short- and long-term consequences of OME [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, it is reasonable to assume that the conductive hearing loss associated with middle ear fluid may increase the risk of speech, language, or learning problems in children with baseline risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Waiting for three months to evaluate the hearing of children who are not at high risk for speech, language, or learning problems allows sufficient time for spontaneous resolution in many cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Tympanostomy tubes may be warranted for children with unilateral or bilateral OME for three months or longer (chronic OME) <strong>and</strong> symptoms that are likely attributable to OME (including, but not limited to, vestibular problems, poor school performance, behavioral problems, ear discomfort, or reduced quality of life) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Definitive long-term evidence of improvement for most outcomes following tympanostomy tube placement is lacking. Tympanostomy tube insertion is associated with short- and intermediate-term resolution of hearing loss, and caregivers have reported postoperative improvements in language skills.

OME usually resolves spontaneously within six weeks. Approximately 30 to 40 percent of children with OME have recurrent episodes. (See <a href=\"#H3441164557\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H377254594\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goals of management are to eliminate the middle ear fluid, restore normal hearing, and, when feasible, prevent future episodes. The primary management options are &quot;watchful waiting&quot; and tympanostomy tube (ventilation tube, grommet) placement. Which option is undertaken, and when, depends upon coexisting conditions that increase the risk of hearing, speech, language, or learning problems; the severity of OME-associated hearing loss; the duration of the effusion; and whether the effusion is unilateral or bilateral (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F117272\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef117272 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1702825961\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&quot;At-risk&quot; children are those who have or are at risk for speech, language, or learning problems. This includes children with hearing loss independent of OME, neurodevelopmental disorders, craniofacial disorders (eg cleft palate), and uncorrectable visual impairment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">For children with OME who are at risk for speech, language, or learning problems, we suggest early surgical referral (ie, within three months) for tympanostomy tube placement (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H377255892\" class=\"local\">'At-risk children'</a> above and <a href=\"#H170941175\" class=\"local\">'Tympanostomy tubes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Prompt surgical referral is warranted for children who have structural damage to the tympanic membrane or middle ear (eg, retraction pocket (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F103800%7EPEDS%2F103801\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103800 graphicRef103801 \">picture 2A-B</a>), tympanosclerosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58460\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58460 \">picture 3</a>), cholesteatoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76079%7EPEDS%2F103803\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76079 graphicRef103803 \">picture 4A-B</a>)).

Children who are managed with watchful waiting should be reevaluated (with pneumatic otoscopy, developmental surveillance, and hearing testing) every three to six months until the effusion has resolved or the child develops an indication for surgical referral.
