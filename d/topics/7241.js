For awake intubation, flexible bronchoscopy is better tolerated than laryngoscopy with a standard laryngoscope.</p><p>This topic will discuss the equipment and techniques used for flexible bronchoscopic intubation, including patient preparation and sedation for awake flexible bronchoscopic intubation. Retrograde intubation using a percutaneous wire will also be discussed.</p><p>While the term &quot;flexible fiberoptic intubation&quot; has been used for this technique in anesthesia, newer bronchoscopes no longer use fiberoptic technology. Therefore, this topic will use the terms &quot;flexible scope intubation&quot; (FSI) for the technique and &quot;flexible intubating scope&quot; (FIS) for the device.</p><p>Other airway devices, techniques for endotracheal intubation, and management of the difficult airway for anesthesia are discussed separately.

Indications for awake intubation include anticipated difficult airway management and the need for a postintubation neurologic exam (eg, unstable cervical spine) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F94754\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef94754 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-difficult-airway-for-general-anesthesia-in-adults#H3654913958\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the difficult airway for general anesthesia in adults&quot;, section on 'Awake intubation'</a>.)</p><p>FSI is more difficult to perform under general anesthesia than in the awake patient, as the loss of pharyngeal muscle tone leads to upper airway collapse and limited fiberoptic visualization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flexible-scope-intubation-for-anesthesia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Most cases are performed using the oral route. The nasal route may be preferred for the patient with a severely limited mouth opening or a strong gag reflex, or if a nasotracheal intubation is necessary for the surgical procedure. Nasal intubation may be better tolerated than oral intubation by the awake patient. In addition, a laryngeal view is often easier to obtain using the nasal approach because the flexible intubating scope (FIS) tends to remain in the midline, with the tip directed at the glottis as it enters the oropharynx.</p><p>The risks of nasal intubation include epistaxis, trauma to the nasal turbinates, and submucosal tunneling in the nasopharynx. Preparation of the nasopharynx is necessary prior to the procedure in order to minimize the chance of bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H73901645\" class=\"local\">'Nasal preparation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Indications and advantages</strong> &ndash; FSI can be used for patients and clinical settings with impediments to direct laryngoscopy, including the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Limited mouth opening, as the FIS will pass through a narrow oral opening or through the nose</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Abnormal airway anatomy or a mass obstructing direct visualization of the vocal cords</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Unstable cervical spine, such that movement of the spine should be minimized during airway management</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Airway trauma requiring visualization of the larynx and trachea prior to intubation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Prone or lateral position requiring rescue intubation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Contraindications and disadvantages</strong> &ndash; There are no absolute contraindications to FSI.

In addition, supraglottic devices designed to facilitate endotracheal intubation can be used along with flexible scopes and may be included with routinely stocked equipment. Equipment for FSI is often kept on a cart that is transported to the intubating location.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89274307\"><span class=\"h2\">Flexible intubating scope</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The FIS is used to locate the vocal cords and acts as a stylet for the endotracheal tube (ETT) once the FIS is placed into the trachea.</p><p>The FIS consists of a flexible insertion cord that contains either optical fibers or a small camera at the tip, used to transmit images to an eyepiece or camera head (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F67231\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67231 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F79391\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79391 \">figure 2</a>). The cord includes a channel for a light source, a working channel for suction or administration of oxygen or local anesthetic, and a cable that allows the operator to flex the tip of the scope. The cord attaches to a handle with a light source, an eyepiece (or camera head), a control lever for <span class=\"nowrap\">flexion/extension</span> of the tip, and a working channel port.</p><p>The FIS is available in various sizes. Bronchoscopes used for intubation need to be narrow enough to fit through an appropriately-sized ETT and long enough for the tip to pass beyond the larynx (including the length of the ETT threaded over the shaft):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Adults</strong> &ndash; Adult intubating bronchoscopes are typically 60 cm in length, with a diameter of 3.8 to 4.2 mm. Adult scopes fit through a 5.5-mm internal diameter (ID) ETT if adequately lubricated, and they have a working channel 1.2 to 2 mm in diameter.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Children</strong> &ndash; Pediatric scopes have diameters of 2.2 mm (accommodated by a 3-mm ID ETT, with no working channel) to 3.1 mm (accommodated by a 4-mm ID ETT, with a working channel 1.2 mm in diameter).</p><p/><p>Most FISs are reusable, but a disposable, single-use flexible videoscope is available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flexible-scope-intubation-for-anesthesia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H372662982\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral airway</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specialized oral airways for FSI are designed to keep the scope in the midline and to act as a bite block for awake oral FSI. Flexible scopes are delicate instruments; a bite block is used to prevent damage to the scope if the patient bites down on it.</p><p>There are several types of oral airways for FSI (eg, Ovassapian, Berman, and Williams) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F99992\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef99992 \">picture 1</a>). The shape is similar to that of a standard oropharyngeal airway used to maintain an open airway for spontaneous or mask ventilation in deeply sedated or anesthetized patients. Because it rests on the base of the tongue and the posterior pharynx, placement of an oral airway may elicit a gag reflex in conscious patients. Therefore, they are used only in patients with general anesthesia, heavy sedation, or with excellent local anesthetic topicalization of the tongue and pharynx.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H372662988\"><span class=\"h2\">Facemask</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oxygen delivery, with or without ventilation, may be provided with a standard facemask with a bronchoscopic adapter attached, or with a specialized endoscopy mask constructed with a port for the bronchoscope (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F94909\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef94909 \">picture 2</a>). Healthy patients are unlikely to require oxygen administration or ventilation during the brief period required for fiberoptic intubation. However, supplemental oxygen may be useful in patients with decreased physiologic reserve or functional residual capacity (ie, pediatric, pregnant, and obese patients), or during difficult FSI.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20064545\"><span class=\"h2\">Other equipment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We usually have the following additional equipment on hand at the time of flexible bronchoscopy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Endotracheal tube </strong>&ndash; Difficulty advancing the ETT through the vocal cords over the FIS is a relatively common problem during FSI. The ETT can be placed in warm saline prior to the procedure. A warmed, softened ETT will usually pass through the vocal cords more easily than an unprepared tube. A flexible ETT, the tapered-tip ETT for use with the intubating laryngeal mask airway (LMA), or a specialized ETT with a bull-nose tip (Parker Flex-Tip) may facilitate advancement. We usually use a Parker ETT for FSI. (See <a href=\"#H1556150066\" class=\"local\">'Difficulty advancing the endotracheal tube'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Antifogging agent</strong> &ndash; An antifogging agent is applied to the tip of the FIS, or the tip is brought to body temperature in warm saline in order to minimize condensation. This maintains a clear image on the lens.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lubricating agent</strong> &ndash; A lubricant facilitates passage of the ETT over the FIS. We use petroleum-based lubricants such as ophthalmic lubricant since water-based lubricants can become sticky as they dry. Although petroleum-based lubricants have traditionally been avoided in the past in order to minimize damage to the outer coating of the FIS shaft, this is not a problem with newer scopes. There is also a theoretic concern for the development of exogenous lipoid pneumonia due to deposition of lipids in the lung, but the small amounts needed for FSI are likely insufficient to be clinically significant. Lubricant should be kept away from the tip of the FIS because it may obscure the view [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flexible-scope-intubation-for-anesthesia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nasopharyngeal airway</strong> &ndash; A nasopharyngeal airway may be used as a method of applying lubricating agents or topical anesthetics in order to prepare the naris for nasal intubation. It can also be used to facilitate ventilation during oral intubation in sedated or anesthetized patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Video monitor</strong> &ndash; The FIS can be connected to a video monitor in order to allow assisting personnel to see the procedure. This may provide a better view than the use of an eyepiece.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Airway preparation equipment</strong> &ndash; Equipment to anesthetize the airway <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vasoconstrict the nasal mucosa includes atomizing devices, nebulizers, syringes and needles, cotton pledgets, and cotton swabs.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H372663012\"><span class=\"h1\">AIRWAY ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The airway begins at the nares, the external openings of the nasal passages. The nasal cavity leads to the nasopharynx, followed by the oropharynx, which extends inferiorly to the level of the epiglottis. The hypopharynx begins at the level of the epiglottis and terminates at the level of the cricoid cartilage, where it is continuous with the esophagus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59721\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59721 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flexible-scope-intubation-for-anesthesia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The larynx is a complex structure of cartilage, muscles, and ligaments, which serves as the inlet to the trachea. When viewed from the pharynx, as during fiberoptic bronchoscopy, the larynx begins at the epiglottis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F94913\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef94913 \">picture 3</a>). The most superior structures within the laryngeal cavity are the false vocal cords. Beneath these are the true vocal cords. The space between the vocal cords is termed the glottis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flexible-scope-intubation-for-anesthesia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The trachea begins at the level of the cricoid cartilage and extends to the carina; this length is 10 to 15 cm in the adult (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F94915\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef94915 \">picture 4</a>). At the carina, the trachea bifurcates into the right and left mainstem bronchi (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F94916\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef94916 \">picture 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flexible-scope-intubation-for-anesthesia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Flexible scope images of the upper airway have posterior structures at the lower part of the image when the operator is standing at the patient's head. When the operator is facing the patient, posterior structures appear at the upper part of the image, rotated 180 degrees.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H372663018\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT PREPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preparation of the patient for flexible scope intubation (FSI) may include administration of antisialagogues; aspiration prophylaxis; topical vasoconstrictors for nasal intubation; and, if awake intubation is planned, local anesthetic topicalization and sedation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1039404693\"><span class=\"h2\">Antisialagogues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Airway-drying agents (antisialagogues) should be administered prior to FSI whether it is performed awake or after induction of general anesthesia. Even tiny amounts of secretions or blood on the optical element can make fiberoptic bronchoscopy difficult or impossible. Secretions can also decrease the efficacy of topical anesthetics. Antisialagogues should be administered at least 15 minutes prior to intubation to achieve full effect. We administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycopyrrolate-glycopyrronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glycopyrrolate</a> 0.2 mg intravenously (IV) at least 15 minutes before beginning the procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H205790\"><span class=\"h2\">Aspiration prophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the patient at high risk for aspiration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F98506\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98506 \">table 1</a>), medication should be administered preoperatively to increase gastric pH and possibly to decrease gastric volume. The choice of these medications is discussed more fully separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-induction-and-intubation-rsii-for-anesthesia#H61805\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence induction and intubation (RSII) for anesthesia&quot;, section on 'Premedication'</a>.)</p><p>Our approach to patients at high risk of aspiration who will undergo FSI is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients at high risk of aspiration because of recent food ingestion, we administer an H<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonist (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranitidine</a> 50 mg IV, ideally 40 to 60 minutes prior to induction) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a> (10 mg IV over one to two minutes).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For fasted patients who are at high risk of aspiration of acidic gastric secretions (eg, severe gastroesophageal reflux disease [GERD], pregnancy), we administer an H<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonist, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a>, and also usually administer sodium citrate 30 mL by mouth (PO). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We position patients at high risk of aspiration head-up for induction and intubation.</p><p/><p>Issues to consider when planning FSI for patients at risk for aspiration include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional time to intubation and airway protection with FSI versus direct laryngoscopy or videolaryngoscopic intubation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cricoid pressure may make FSI more difficult.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Topicalization can impair airway reflexes.</p><p/><p>Airway topicalization can compromise airway protective reflexes and should be performed selectively but thoroughly in patients at high risk of aspiration. In such patients, the oropharynx can be anesthetized and topical glossopharyngeal nerve blocks can be performed in order to blunt the gag reflex, but laryngeal and subglottic anesthesia should be avoided until immediately prior to intubation. This can be accomplished by spraying local anesthetic solution through the flexible bronchoscope as it is advanced during the process of laryngoscopy and intubation. (See <a href=\"#H73901568\" class=\"local\">'Airway anesthesia'</a> below.)</p><p>The key to awake intubation in the patient with a full stomach is a smooth course, with avoidance of gagging, coughing, and vomiting. Whenever possible, the intubation should not be rushed. Rather, adequate time should be allowed for full local anesthetic effect.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H205796\"><span class=\"h2\">Positioning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Usually, FSI takes place in the <span class=\"nowrap\">sitting/beach-chair,</span> lateral decubitus, or supine positions, but it has also been described in the prone position as a rescue technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flexible-scope-intubation-for-anesthesia/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p>Awake patients should be placed in the lateral or sitting position, which can improve visualization of the glottis compared with the supine position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flexible-scope-intubation-for-anesthesia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. When performing FSI with the patient in the sitting or beach-chair position, the clinician should stand at the patient's side [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flexible-scope-intubation-for-anesthesia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Supine positioning is typically used in patients under general anesthesia, with the clinician at the patient's head (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F99783\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef99783 \">picture 6</a>). With the patient supine, the laryngeal view through the flexible intubating scope (FIS) is in the same orientation as during direct laryngoscopy, and the patient and clinician are already in the optimal position to perform mask ventilation or other airway maneuvers, if necessary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F99783\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef99783 \">picture 6</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H73901645\"><span class=\"h2\">Nasal preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For nasal intubation, a topical vasoconstrictor should be applied to the nasal mucosa in order to reduce the chance of bleeding with passage of the FIS and endotracheal tube (ETT). Commercially available nasal decongestants containing either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxymetazoline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxymetazoline</a> 0.05% or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenylephrine</a> 0.5% may be used to constrict the vessels of the nasal mucosa. We administer two sprays of phenylephrine or oxymetazoline to each nostril for vasoconstriction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1039404872\"><span class=\"h2\">Awake intubation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When awake intubation is planned, in addition to the preparations already described, the airway must be anesthetized, and the patient may require sedation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H73901562\"><span class=\"h3\">Sedation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision to use sedation during awake intubation is made on a case-by-case basis. The goals of sedation for FSI are to have the patient tolerate the procedure and remain cooperative by providing anxiolysis, amnesia, and analgesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flexible-scope-intubation-for-anesthesia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Sedative agents should be carefully titrated to maintain adequate respiration, airway reflexes, and cooperative behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flexible-scope-intubation-for-anesthesia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In general, we prefer medications that can be reversed (eg, opioids) or those with a short duration of action (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>). Minimal sedation should be used for patients in whom there is particular concern for aspiration or respiratory decompensation. Benzodiazepines, opioids, IV hypnotics, and alpha<sub>2</sub> agonists can be used alone or in combination. Medications and doses commonly used for sedation during fiberoptic intubation are shown in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F94490\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94490 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>While there are a number of acceptable sedation regimens, and clinical practice varies, we commonly administer one of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=remifentanil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Remifentanil</a> infusion (titrated infusion starting at 0.05 to 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/min)</span> with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> (1 to 2 mg IV, repeated as necessary to a total dose of 0.025 to 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV) <strong>or</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexmedetomidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dexmedetomidine</a> (bolus 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> IV over 10 minutes, followed by infusion of 0.2 to 0.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/hr),</span> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> as above, <strong>or</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incremental doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> as above, with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> (25 to 200 mcg IV in divided doses).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H73901568\"><span class=\"h3\">Airway anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For awake intubation, the airway must be anesthetized using topical anesthetics or nerve blocks.

Our general approach is to do the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lubricate the shaft of the flexible intubating scope (FIS). (See <a href=\"#H20064545\" class=\"local\">'Other equipment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attach oxygen or suction to the suction port, if desired.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apply antifogging agent to the tip of the FIS, or pre-warm the tip in saline.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prepare the FIS &ndash; Check the light, focus the optics, and confirm the proper view orientation and the direction of tip movement with control-lever movement. The control lever bends the tip up and down, allowing it to follow the curves of the airway; rotation of the entire instrument allows the tip to move left and right.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obtain a standing stool in order to allow the operator to hold the bronchoscope straight above the patient's head during insertion, if necessary, because control of the movement of the FIS shaft and tip are more effective when the shaft is straight (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F99783\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef99783 \">picture 6</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1562087333\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H73901656\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral intubation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most often, flexible scope intubation (FSI) is performed using the oral route. The endotracheal tube (ETT) may be loaded on the flexible intubating scope (FIS) prior to inserting it and moved up the full length of the shaft to the handle in order to avoid interference with movement of the scope. We tape the ETT directly to the scope handle to keep it from sliding. If the ETT connector is removed prior to placement on the FIS, it must not be lost; we tape it to the breathing circuit.</p><p>A bite block or intubating oral airway may be placed, if desired. When using an intubating oral airway, it is usually easier to place the ETT into the oral airway to a depth of 5 cm, rather than loading it directly onto the FIS. (See <a href=\"#H372662982\" class=\"local\">'Oral airway'</a> above.)</p><p>The oropharynx should be suctioned prior to inserting the FIS.</p><p>The FIS should be oriented so that the tip can be moved up and down in the midline. The FIS is inserted (without a bend at the tip) along the midline of the oropharynx. The FIS must remain in the midline as it is directed around the base of the tongue in order to achieve a satisfactory view of the larynx. When the posterior oropharynx is encountered, the tip should be flexed and advanced around the base of the tongue until the epiglottis or glottis is seen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F94913\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef94913 \">picture 3</a>). Suction or insufflation of oxygen may be used to clear additional secretions that obscure the view.</p><p>Local anesthetic may be sprayed on the cords to decrease reactivity (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> 4%, 1 mL). The FIS should be advanced through the vocal cords to the level of the carina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F94916\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef94916 \">picture 5</a>), and the ETT advanced over it. The initial depth for oral intubation should be 22 cm for women and 24 cm for men. The FIS may then be withdrawn from the ETT, and the position of the ETT can be confirmed with end-tidal carbon dioxide and breath sounds in the usual manner. (See <a href=\"#H1556150066\" class=\"local\">'Difficulty advancing the endotracheal tube'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H73901668\"><span class=\"h2\">Nasal intubation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For nasal intubation, the ETT should be placed in warm saline for several minutes to soften it and make it more flexible in order to minimize bleeding caused by trauma to the nasal mucosa.</p><p>The more patent nostril should be selected for intubation. This can be determined by manually occluding each nostril separately and asking the patient to inhale through the nose. The patient will usually be able to inhale more easily through one naris. Alternatively, one can use the scope to visualize the nasal passages or use soft plastic nasopharyngeal airways to gauge patency of the nasal airway.</p><p>The ETT should be lubricated, and lubricant should be applied to the selected naris by passing a nasopharyngeal airway liberally coated with 4% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> ointment.</p><p>There are two methods for navigating the nasal passage during flexible scope nasal intubation. Loading the ETT onto the FIS and first performing nasal endoscopy ensures that the more favorable route through the nasal passage is taken (beneath the inferior turbinate). This route is associated with less epistaxis and may decrease the incidence of avulsion of a nasal turbinate. The disadvantage of this technique is that one may navigate the FIS through the nasal passage and into the trachea only to find that the nasal passage is insufficient to accommodate the ETT.</p><p>Alternatively, a warmed, softened ETT is inserted into the naris to a depth of approximately 14 to 15 cm prior to inserting the FIS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flexible-scope-intubation-for-anesthesia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The bevel of the ETT should face the lateral wall of the nasal passage, and cephalad traction should be applied to the ETT as it is advanced in order to minimize the risk of damage to a nasal turbinate and to maximize the odds of the ETT passing inferiorly to the inferior turbinate. The FIS is then passed through the ETT; most often, the larynx is visible as soon as the scope tip exits the ETT. The authors prefer this technique.</p><p>The oropharynx should be suctioned prior to inserting the FIS. Secretions that obscure the view may be cleared using suction or insufflation of oxygen through the working channel. The tip should be directed by using the control lever, rotating the entire FIS, and advancing or withdrawing the scope until the cords are directly ahead of the tip. Local anesthetic (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> 4%, 2 to 3 mL) may be sprayed on the cords to decrease reactivity prior to passing through the larynx. The FIS should be advanced through the cords to the level of the carina, and the ETT advanced over it. The initial depth of insertion of the ETT for nasal intubation should be 26 cm for women and 28 cm for men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flexible-scope-intubation-for-anesthesia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1556150066\" class=\"local\">'Difficulty advancing the endotracheal tube'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1641240778\"><span class=\"h2\">Retrograde intubation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retrograde intubation is used most commonly in the unstable cervical spine, in upper airway malignancy, in mandibular fracture, or when the vocal cords cannot be visualized due to blood, secretions, or anatomic variations; it may be used in combination with a FIS. A wire (or catheter) is inserted percutaneously through the cricothyroid membrane and blindly cephalad along the trachea, larynx, pharynx, and out of the mouth or naris; this wire is then used to guide passage of an ETT from the mouth or nose into the trachea.</p><p>This technique may be used with or without a FIS. Commercially available retrograde intubation kits have a 0.037-inch guidewire that may not fit through the working channel of some FISs, so compatibility must be checked prior to using this technique with a FIS.</p><p>Once the guidewire is retrieved from either the mouth or naris, retrograde intubation begins by securing the wire with a hemostat outside the cricothyroid insertion site in order to avoid pulling through and to maintain tension. When this is performed without an FIS, an ETT is then threaded over the taut wire until it passes the larynx. After removing the wire, the ETT is advanced to the appropriate distance (usually to 22 cm for women, 24 cm for men), confirmed in the usual fashion, and secured.</p><p>When a FIS is used for assistance, an ETT is placed on the FIS prior to retrieving the end of the wire from the mouth or naris and passing it through the working channel of the FIS from distal to proximal. The FIS is then passed over the guidewire and into the glottis until resistance is met at the cricothyroid membrane. The hemostat that held the guidewire taut may now be released and the guidewire removed. The FIS is advanced until the carina is visualized and the ETT is passed into the trachea.</p><p>There are several advantages to using an FIS for this technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flexible-scope-intubation-for-anesthesia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The outer diameter of the guidewire and the internal diameter of the fiberoptic suction port fit snugly so that the FIS advances through the vocal cords without catching on anatomic structures</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The FIS forms a more secure guide than the wire for the ETT</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The trachea is accessed under direct vision</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The FIS advances to the carina freely (past puncture site), minimizing the potential for the ETT to become dislodged when the wire is removed (due to the short distance between the vocal cords and puncture site)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oxygen may be continuously administered via the FIS throughout the procedure (including while the guidewire is still in place)</p><p/><p>The main disadvantage to the addition of FIS guidance to the retrograde technique is the need for additional equipment and preparation time, which may not be available in emergency cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1556149949\"><span class=\"h1\">TROUBLESHOOTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Flexible scope intubation (FSI) is a complex procedure that requires practice and may not be straightforward.

An Aintree catheter loaded in over the FIS within the ETT will minimize this gap, but this must be done prior to inserting the FIS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A combination technique may be indicated; that is, the use of laryngoscopy, either direct or indirect, may facilitate clearance of the tongue, elevation of the epiglottis, and advancement of the ETT.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2118860\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flexible scope intubation (FSI) is an indirect technique for endotracheal intubation using a flexible bronchoscope. FSI is particularly useful for patients in whom direct laryngoscopy may be difficult or dangerous (eg, limited mouth opening, abnormal airway anatomy, unstable cervical spine). (See <a href=\"#H205518\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FSI can be used for nasal or oral endotracheal intubation. (See <a href=\"#H73901656\" class=\"local\">'Oral intubation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H73901668\" class=\"local\">'Nasal intubation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FSI may be difficult or impossible if blood or secretions are in the airway.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An assortment of specialized equipment required for FSI is usually kept on a mobile cart for easy transport to the anesthetizing location. (See <a href=\"#H372662969\" class=\"local\">'Equipment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With effective topical airway anesthesia, FSI is better tolerated by the awake or sedated patient than is intubation with direct laryngoscopy. FSI can also be performed after induction of anesthesia. (See <a href=\"#H73901568\" class=\"local\">'Airway anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An airway-drying agent, or antisialagogue (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycopyrrolate-glycopyrronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glycopyrrolate</a>, 0.2 mg IV), should be administered at least 15 minutes prior to FSI. If nasal intubation is planned, a topical nasal mucosal vasoconstrictor should be applied before intubation (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxymetazoline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxymetazoline</a> 0.05%, two puffs to each nostril three times at five-minute intervals). (See <a href=\"#H1039404693\" class=\"local\">'Antisialagogues'</a> above and <a href=\"#H73901645\" class=\"local\">'Nasal preparation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral intubation steps are as follows (see <a href=\"#H73901656\" class=\"local\">'Oral intubation'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A bite block or intubating oral airway is placed, and the oropharynx is suctioned.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The endotracheal tube (ETT) is placed into the intubating airway to a depth of 5 cm or is loaded directly onto and secured to the handle of the lubricated flexible intubating scope (FIS).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The FIS is oriented so that the tip can be moved up and down in the midline and is inserted without a bend at the tip along the midline of the oropharynx (or into the ETT, if in the oral airway).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The larynx should be visible in the midline; the FIS is passed through the vocal cords to the carina.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The ETT is advanced over the FIS to 22 cm for women or 24 cm for men.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The FIS is withdrawn, and the ETT position is confirmed in the usual manner.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nasal intubation steps are as follows (see <a href=\"#H73901668\" class=\"local\">'Nasal intubation'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The softened (warmed), lubricated ETT should be inserted into the selected naris to a depth of approximately 15 cm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>After suctioning the oropharynx, the lubricated FIS is passed through the ETT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The larynx is usually visible distal to the ETT; the bronchoscope is passed through the vocal cords to the carina.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The ETT is advanced over the bronchoscope to 26 cm for women or 28 cm for men.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The bronchoscope is withdrawn, and the ETT position is confirmed in the usual manner.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Various maneuvers may be used to open the upper airway, improve visualization, locate the larynx, and facilitate passage of the ETT. (See <a href=\"#H1556149949\" class=\"local\">'Troubleshooting'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1556150066\" class=\"local\">'Difficulty advancing the endotracheal tube'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When other methods for intubation are not possible, retrograde intubation can be performed with or without the use of a FIS. A wire is inserted into the trachea through the cricothyroid membrane and passed cephalad, exiting the mouth or nose. The wire is fed through the working channel of the FIS; the FIS, loaded with an ETT over it, is passed over the wire into the trachea. The ETT is then passed over the FIS into the trachea.
