Without a formal checkout procedure, anesthesia providers are not likely to detect all machine problems. A prospective study published in 1984 noted that fewer than 5 percent of a sample of attendees at a professional anesthesia meeting could find all five faults intentionally created in an anesthesia machine (the average number of faults detected was 2.2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-machines-prevention-diagnosis-and-management-of-malfunctions/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In a 2007 follow-up study, attendees found an average of 3.1 of five intentionally created faults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-machines-prevention-diagnosis-and-management-of-malfunctions/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Notably, formal checklists were not used by the participants in these studies.</p><p>A number of national and international organizations have created pre-use checklists for the anesthesia workstation. The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Anesthesia Machine Checkout Recommendations are used in the United States (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F101563\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101563 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-machines-prevention-diagnosis-and-management-of-malfunctions/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Similar anesthesia workstation checkout recommendations have been published in other countries, (eg, the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland [AAGBI] and the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists [ANZCA]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-machines-prevention-diagnosis-and-management-of-malfunctions/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The ASA recommendations are unique since they specify that some checks can be routinely accomplished by support personnel (eg, anesthesia technicians) to ensure compliance and lessen clinician workload. Since no single checkout procedure is applicable to all machines, the ASA and other professional society recommendations are meant to serve as general guidelines and should be modified as necessary for the anesthesia delivery system(s) available in a local practice. </p><p>With advances in integrated computer technology, many new anesthesia workstations perform an automated pre-use checkout when powered on. Electronic prompts on the workstation screen communicate additional steps that the anesthesia provider must perform to complete the non-automated portions of the checkout procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2478254467\"><span class=\"h2\">American Society of Anesthesiologists Anesthesia Machine Checkout</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, the ASA Anesthesia Machine Checkout Recommendations are most commonly used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F101563\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101563 \">table 1</a>).

Most problems with machine function are preventable, and the root cause is more likely to be improper use than frank equipment failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-machines-prevention-diagnosis-and-management-of-malfunctions/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2225009795\"><span class=\"h2\">Loss of electrical supply</span></p><p>(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F113667\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113667 \">table 2</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Potential problems </strong>&ndash; Anesthesia workstations require electrical power for its monitors and alarms, screen displays, and ventilator controls. In addition, newer anesthesia machines typically have electrically powered ventilators, compressed gas flowmeters, and vaporizers for administration of volatile anesthetics. Thus, the functionality of anesthesia workstations is severely compromised if electrical power fails, although all have integrated backup batteries that allow continued operation for a short period of time (typically, 30 minutes to approximately one hour).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prevention </strong>&ndash; Alternating current (AC) and battery power should be confirmed during the pre-use checkout (item #3) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F101563\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101563 \">table 1</a>) (see <a href=\"#H2478254467\" class=\"local\">'American Society of Anesthesiologists Anesthesia Machine Checkout'</a> above). The power source indicators on the anesthesia workstation show the presence of both AC and backup battery power. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diagnosis </strong>&ndash; The first obvious sign of power failure may be an electrical power loss alarm, or even complete workstation shutdown once the batteries are no longer providing power (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F113667\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113667 \">table 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Troubleshooting </strong>&ndash; All anesthesia workstations are able to support manual ventilation with oxygen in the event of total electrical failure. This should be initiated while the root cause of the problem is sought. In some workstations the normal flowmeter controls and displays are used for this; in other machines, backup flowmeter controls and displays must be used.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Troubleshooting strategies for loss of electrical are described in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F113667\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113667 \">table 2</a>).

Notably, this situation is very rare, but potentially devastating. This is another reason to calibrate the oxygen analyzer as part of the pre-use checkout of the anesthesia machine, thereby ensuring that the oxygen analyzer reads 21 percent in-room air and &gt;90 percent when the breathing system is flushed with oxygen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F101563\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101563 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3254222574\" class=\"local\">'Standardized anesthesia machine checkout'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3347959329\" class=\"local\">'Oxygen analyzer'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diagnosis </strong>&ndash; There is only an alarm for low oxygen supply pressure. If the supply pressure of any gas is low, the flowmeter reading for that gas will be lower than the expected setting, or even zero. Gauges on the anesthesia workstation show the pressures of all compressed gases. Pipelines should nominally supply gases at 45 to 55 pounds psig (equivalent to 310 to 380 kilopascals [kPa]). A full oxygen cylinder has a pressure of 2000 psig (13,790 kPa) and contains 625 L of oxygen; however, cylinder gauges show the correct pressure only if the cylinder is open. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A low inspired oxygen alarm may indicate wrong gas administration due to misconnection anywhere in the gas supply chain (eg, wrong gas in cylinder, misconnected hose). Wrong gas administration should be suspected whenever steady-state gas concentrations in the breathing circuit are dramatically different than those predicted from compressed gas flowmeter settings.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Troubleshooting </strong>&ndash; In the event of low oxygen supply pressure during a case, open the oxygen cylinder, conserve anesthesia machine oxygen supply (turn off auxiliary flowmeter if not in use, lower fresh gas oxygen flow, turn off pneumatically driven ventilator), and obtain additional backup cylinders.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the event of a wrong gas coming from the oxygen pipeline, it is critically important to disconnect the anesthesia machine from the oxygen pipeline source and open the backup cylinder. If the backup cylinder is opened while the pipeline source is still connected the problem will persist since gases are preferentially drawn from the pipelines instead of the cylinders. If low oxygen supply pressure is a persistent problem, disconnect the patient from the anesthesia machine and initiate positive pressure ventilation with a self-inflating manual ventilation device attached to a fresh oxygen cylinder (see <a href=\"#H2403854314\" class=\"local\">'Backup equipment for oxygenation and ventilation'</a> below). Do not use the auxiliary oxygen flowmeter on the anesthesia workstation since it has the same oxygen source as the anesthesia breathing circuit. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3702178924\"><span class=\"h2\">Compressed gas flowmeter malfunction</span></p><p>(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F113670\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113670 \">table 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F113676\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113676 \">table 11</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Potential problems </strong>&ndash; While many new workstations have electronic flowmeters, some new and most older anesthesia machines have glass flowmeters (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F114872\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114872 \">figure 3</a>). Glass flowmeters are more prone to malfunction due to physical issues (eg, contamination, leaks, cracks) compared with electronic flowmeters. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Miscalibration &ndash; All flowmeters are factory calibrated for a specific gas based on that gas's density, viscosity, and specific heat; thus, any flowmeter gives incorrect readings for other gases. Glass flowmeters consist of a tube and a float that are calibrated as a matched set, and register incorrect readings if mismatched. Also, dirt, oil, or water contamination and static electricity buildup can cause incorrect readings. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Leak &ndash; Flowmeters may become cracked, broken, or loosened, resulting in a leak in that flowmeter and any upstream flowmeters. For this reason, oxygen flowmeters are always positioned downstream, so that oxygen will not be lost unless the leak is in the oxygen flowmeter itself (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F114773\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114773 \">figure 5</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prevention </strong>&ndash; Flowmeter malfunctions are very rare with the glass and electronic flowmeters installed on newer anesthesia machines.

However, this circuit leak test is relatively insensitive to small leaks (eg, &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute</span> with a generated pressure of 30 cmH<sub>2</sub>O) and does not detect internal leaks in some anesthesia machines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Thus, in anesthesia machines that do not perform an automated leak test, we instead employ a more sensitive method to test for leaks. This involves removing the reservoir bag and occluding the circuit at both the Y-piece and the site of the reservoir bag connection, then pressurizing the breathing system by slowly turning up the oxygen flow. With this test, the leak rate is the oxygen flow rate at the point where the circuit pressure remains steady at 30 cmH<sub>2</sub>O. This method also tests for internal leaks in the anesthesia machine that are downstream of the flow meters, including those caused by an anesthetic vaporizer with a dial that is turned on (see <a href=\"#H262656089\" class=\"local\">'Vaporizer malfunction'</a> above). A leak &gt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> at 30 cmH<sub>2</sub>O should prompt a search for the source of the leak. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Notably, newer machines have few visible connections to the fresh gas outlet, ventilator, scavenging system, or airway flow and pressure analyzers. Thus, there is a low risk of misconnection, which was historically a relatively common source of gas delivery system malfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-machines-prevention-diagnosis-and-management-of-malfunctions/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. These newer anesthesia machines use sensitive methods during the automated pre-use checkout to measure any breathing system leak and the compliance of the system. While the specific method depends on the make and model of the anesthesia workstation, in most cases the breathing circuit is pressurized with the reservoir bag in place, and the machine adjusts the flow of gas into the breathing circuit to maintain a stable circuit pressure as measured by a sensitive electronic gauge. However, as noted above, these automated machine pre-use checks will not detect a leak in the vaporizer or its manifold unless repeated with each vaporizer turned on.

In other countries, a modified Mapleson D system (the Bain system) is often used during anesthesia or transport for small children and neonates. Anesthesia providers using different types of Mapleson circuits must be specifically trained in their use because different circuit configurations, ventilation modes, fresh gas flow rates, and minute ventilation all interact to affect the partial pressure of arterial CO<sub>2 </sub>(PaCO<sub>2</sub>) level.
