The potential effects of fibroids on pregnancy and the potential effects of pregnancy on fibroids are a frequent clinical concern since these tumors are common in women of reproductive age. Most pregnant women with fibroids do not have any complications during pregnancy related to the fibroids. Pain is the most common problem, and there may be a slightly increased risk of obstetrical complications such as miscarriage, premature labor and delivery, abnormal fetal position, and placental abruption.</p><p>This topic will review issues specifically relating to pregnant women with uterine fibroids. Fibroids in nonpregnant women, including fertility issues, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-epidemiology-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-natural-history\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine leiomyomas (fibroids): Epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and natural history&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reproductive-issues-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reproductive issues in women with uterine leiomyomas (fibroids)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H606443784\"><span class=\"h1\">LIMITATIONS OF AVAILABLE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several factors make it difficult to assess the impact of fibroids on pregnancy outcome and identify specific fibroid characteristics that are important. For example, the mechanisms whereby fibroids may cause adverse obstetric outcomes are not clearly understood. In addition, available evidence is difficult to interpret due to the heterogeneity of the study populations in these reports, which differ in fibroid number, size, location (lower uterus, fundus), and type (submucosal, intramural, or subserosal; pedunculated or sessile); gestational age at diagnosis; and method of ascertainment (eg, prospective versus retrospective study design). Lastly, small fibroids (&lt;4 to 5 cm) may not be detected consistently because they can be difficult to distinguish from physiologically thickened myometrium.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of uterine fibroids in pregnancy varies between 1.6 and 10.7 percent, depending upon the trimester of assessment and the size threshold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. In one study, 4 percent of 12,708 pregnant patients had fibroids with a diameter &gt;3 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In another, 1.6 percent of 12,600 consecutive pregnant patients had fibroids &gt;1 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A third series in over 15,000 women with nonanomalous singleton pregnancies undergoing routine second trimester ultrasonography reported that 2.7 percent had fibroids &ge;1 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A fourth series of 4271 first trimester or post-miscarriage ultrasound examinations observed 10.7 percent of women had a fibroid of &ge;0.5 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-epidemiology-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-natural-history#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine leiomyomas (fibroids): Epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and natural history&quot;, section on 'Prevalence'</a>.)</p><p>The prevalence of fibroids increases with age and is higher in African-American women than in white or Hispanic women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Increasing parity and prolonged duration of breastfeeding are associated with a small, but statistically significant, reduction in prevalence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CHANGE IN SIZE DURING PREGNANCY AND POSTPARTUM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnancy-related increases in estrogen and progesterone levels, uterine blood flow, and possibly human chorionic gonadotropin levels, are believed to affect fibroid growth. Most studies that have sonographically monitored the size of fibroids across pregnancy have refuted the commonly held belief that fibroids increase in size throughout gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/3,7-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7-13</a>], although there are exceptions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. It appears that fibroid size remains stable (&lt;10 percent change) across gestation in 50 to 60 percent of cases, increases in 22 to 32 percent, and decreases in 8 to 27 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/7,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11,12</a>].</p><p>Inconsistent data on the effect of pregnancy on fibroid growth may be due the gestational age of the ultrasound assessments since the pattern of fibroid growth during pregnancy is probably not linear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/7,11-14,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11-14,17,18</a>]. For example, in those fibroids that increase in size, most of the growth occurs in the first trimester, with little if any further increase in size during the second and third trimesters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/7,11,12,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11,12,16</a>]. Larger fibroids (&gt;5 cm in diameter) are more likely to grow, whereas smaller fibroids are more likely to remain stable in size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The mean increase in fibroid volume during pregnancy is 12 percent, and very few fibroids increase by more than 25 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>Almost 90 percent of women with fibroids detected in the first trimester will have regression in total fibroid volume when re-evaluated three to six months postpartum, but 10 percent will have an increase in volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Regression may be less in women who use progestin-only contraception.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37580341\"><span class=\"h1\">SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uterine fibroids are usually asymptomatic during pregnancy. In symptomatic women, symptoms include pain, pelvic pressure, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vaginal bleeding.</p><p>Pain is the most common symptom; the frequency correlates with size and is especially high in women with fibroids &gt;5 cm in diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/2,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,20</a>]. Most patients have only localized pain, without other signs and symptoms, although mild leukocytosis, fever, and nausea and vomiting can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Fibroid pain typically presents in the late first or early second trimester, which corresponds to the period of greatest fibroid growth and, in turn, propensity to degeneration. Pain also may result from partial obstruction of the vessels supplying the fibroid as the uterus grows and changes its orientation to the fibroid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], or from torsion. (See <a href=\"#H3695835\" class=\"local\">'Degeneration and torsion'</a> below.)</p><p>Symptoms resulting from ectopic hormone production (eg, erythropoietin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], parathyroid-related protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>], prolactin) are rare.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uterine fibroids have long been implicated as a cause of adverse pregnancy events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, there are no well-designed studies that provide high-quality data on the relationship between fibroids and pregnancy outcome. As discussed above (see <a href=\"#H606443784\" class=\"local\">'Limitations of available information'</a> above), the available information consists largely of observational series and case reports that are limited by different patient populations; different criteria regarding the size, location, and number of fibroids; small numbers of adverse events; ascertainment bias in selecting study participants; and inadequate adjustment of confounders.</p><p>Most pregnant women with fibroids do not have any complications during pregnancy related to the fibroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. When complications occur, painful degeneration is the most common complication. There also appears to be a slightly increased risk of complications such as miscarriage, premature labor and delivery, abnormal fetal position, and placental abruption, but all studies do not show an increased risk of adverse events. The following list of pregnancy complications begins with those most strongly associated with fibroids and ends with those least associated with fibroids.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3695835\"><span class=\"h2\">Degeneration and torsion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As discussed above, pain is one of the most common symptoms of fibroids in pregnant women and is typically due to fibroid degeneration or, rarely, torsion. Rapid growth of fibroids can result in a relative decrease in perfusion, leading to ischemia and necrosis (red degeneration) and release of prostaglandins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Pedunculated fibroids are at risk of torsion and necrosis, but this is much less common than degeneration.</p><p>The diagnosis of degeneration and torsion is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-epidemiology-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-natural-history#H3784133710\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine leiomyomas (fibroids): Epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and natural history&quot;, section on 'Fibroid degeneration or torsion'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Miscarriage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some patients, submucosal fibroids appear to adversely affect implantation, placentation, and ongoing pregnancy. The effects of intramural fibroids are more controversial, while fibroids that are primarily subserosal or pedunculated are unlikely to cause adverse outcomes. The risk of pregnancy loss may be higher when there are multiple fibroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The mechanisms by which fibroids may cause pregnancy loss are not known; the following hypotheses have been proposed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The fibroid may interfere with placentation and development of normal uteroplacental circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. As an example, a large submucosal fibroid projecting into the uterine cavity may compress the decidualized endometrium, leading to decidual atrophy or distortion of the vascular architecture and blood flow supplying and draining the decidua at that site.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapid fibroid growth with or without degeneration may lead to increased uterine contractility or altered production of catalytic enzymes by the placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>], both of which may disrupt placentation, leading to spontaneous abortion.</p><p/><p>When fibroid location was not considered, a meta-analysis of nine cohort studies found no association between fibroid presence and miscarriage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>These issues are discussed in more detail separately.

Characteristics reported to increase this risk include multiple fibroids, placentation adjacent to or overlying the fibroid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/7,10,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10,38</a>], and size greater than 5 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. As with other complications, this association is not consistent across the literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/2,40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,40-42</a>]. We do not consider fibroids an indication to monitor cervical length with ultrasound during pregnancy.</p><p>Various theories have been proposed to explain the biologic basis of preterm labor in the setting of uterine fibroids. As an example, it is possible that fibroid uteri are less distensible than nonfibroid uteri, so that contractions occur when the uterus distends beyond a certain point [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/20,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,31</a>]. Others have noted decreased oxytocinase activity in the gravid fibroid uterus, which may result in a localized increase in oxytocin levels, thereby predisposing to premature contractions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

The location of the fibroid in relation to the placenta appears to be an important determinant and implies that bleeding is related to abruption. Pooled cumulative data suggest the risk of abruption is increased threefold in women with fibroids (unadjusted OR 3.2, 95% CI 2.6-4.0) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Submucosal and retroplacental fibroids and fibroids with volumes &gt;200 mL (corresponding to 7 to 8 cm diameter) are associated with the highest risk of abruption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/2,10,20,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,10,20,44</a>]. As an example, in a retrospective analysis of 6706 consecutive pregnant patients, <span class=\"nowrap\">8/14</span> patients (57 percent) with retroplacental fibroids developed placental abruption with the deaths of four fetuses, while only two abruptions occurred among the 79 patients (2.5 percent) whose fibroids were not retroplacental, and neither of these resulted in fetal death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>A hypothesis for the increased risk of abruption in women with fibroids is that the fibroid causes abnormal perfusion of the placental site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. When 133Xenon was used to measure regional blood flow in the uteri of 11 nonpregnant patients undergoing laparotomy, blood flow was significantly reduced in the myometrium adjacent to fibroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The authors suggested that the decidua overlying a fibroid may have reduced blood flow, leading to placental ischemia and decidual necrosis, making the area more susceptible to antepartum bleeding and abruption.

In the same way, large submucosal fibroids that distort the uterine cavity have been consistently associated with fetal malpresentation (unadjusted OR 2.9, 95% CI 2.6-3.2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. One of the largest studies used a population-based cohort of over 72,000 consecutive women with singleton pregnancies in Washington State (1990 to 2007) who underwent routine second trimester fetal anatomic survey at a single university hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This study reported a significant increase in breech presentation in women with fibroids (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3-1.9). Other studies noted an increased incidence of malpresentation only if the uterus had multiple fibroids, if there was a fibroid located behind the placenta or in the lower uterine segment, or if the fibroid was large (over 10 cm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/1,7,20,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,20,48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Dysfunctional labor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Theoretically, fibroids in the myometrium may decrease the force of uterine contractions or disrupt the coordinated spread of the contractile wave, thereby leading to dysfunctional labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/42,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,49</a>].

A limitation of the analysis was that results were not stratified according to the location and type of the myomas (eg, pedunculated, subserosal, intramural, submucosal), and these characteristic affect the risk of hemorrhage. For example, favorable results have been reported for removal of pedunculated fibroids at the time of cesarean delivery.

Available data, although limited, suggest that the risk of uterine rupture after myomectomy is not significantly greater than that for a patient attempting trial of labor after cesarean in labor. In a 2016 systematic review of studies with at least five cases of pregnancy after myomectomy, the overall incidence of uterine rupture after myomectomy was <span class=\"nowrap\">7/756</span> or 0.93 percent (95% CI 0.45-1.92 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>].
