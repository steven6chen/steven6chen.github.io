These medications are available in both immediate-release and extended-release preparations; the latter are in wide clinical use (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F51498\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51498 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blocker-poisoning/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The potential toxicity of these agents is substantial, and is often under appreciated by the public. As an example, over 9500 cases of CCB intoxication, caused by intentional or unintentional overdosage, were reported to poison centers in the United States during 2002 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blocker-poisoning/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Although only 16 percent of all cardiovascular drug exposures were due to CCBs, this class accounted for 38 percent of deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blocker-poisoning/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The management of CCB intoxication will be reviewed here. A summary table to facilitate emergent management is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63193\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63193 \">table 1</a>). An overview of the major side effects of CCBs is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-and-safety-of-calcium-channel-blockers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects and safety of calcium channel blockers&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The calcium channel blockers (CCBs) can be divided into two major categories based upon their predominant physiologic effects: the dihydropyridines, which preferentially block the L-type calcium channels in the vasculature; and the nondihydropyridines, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a>, which selectively block L-type calcium channels in the myocardium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blocker-poisoning/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>].</p><p>The L-type calcium channels are responsible for myocardial contractility and vascular smooth muscle contractility; they also affect conducting and pacemaker cells. The dihydropyridines (including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nifedipine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amlodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amlodipine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=felodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">felodipine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nicardipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nicardipine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nisoldipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nisoldipine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isradipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isradipine</a>, and lacidipine) are potent vasodilators that have little negative effect upon cardiac contractility or conduction at standard doses. In contrast, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> and, to a lesser extent, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a> are weak vasodilators but have a depressive effect on cardiac conduction and contractility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blocker-poisoning/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Dihydropyridine intoxication generally results in arterial vasodilation and reflex tachycardia, whereas <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> toxicity cause peripheral vasodilation, decreased cardiac inotropy, and bradycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blocker-poisoning/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, as the dose is increased, this selectivity can be lost, and dihydropyridine CCBs (including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nifedipine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amlodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amlodipine</a>) may affect the myocardium and conducting system like verapamil and diltiazem (ie, decreased inotropy and bradycardia).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOKINETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are highly protein bound, have a large volume of distribution, and are metabolized in the liver. As the dose is increased, the rate of CCB clearance decreases, prolonging the half-life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blocker-poisoning/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Extended-release preparations slowly release the drug from a matrix to facilitate once-daily dosing. In overdose, this property makes absorption unpredictable, and prolongs the duration of toxicity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whenever possible, determine the time of ingestion, as well as the type, amount, and preparation (immediate or sustained release) of drug ingested. The identity of the drug ingested will help predict toxicity, and the type of preparation will help determine the appropriate approach to gastrointestinal decontamination. Patients ingesting more than 5 to 10 times the usual dose can develop signs of severe intoxication.</p><p>It is important to clarify whether the ingestion was accidental or intentional, and to assess the patient for suicidality; however, this determination is often made after resolution of the acute episode. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Suicidal ideation and behavior in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vital sign abnormalities include hypotension, which may be seen in any calcium channel blocker (CCB) overdose, and bradycardia, which usually is seen only in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a> overdose. However, bradycardia may also be seen with severe dihydropyridine (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nifedipine</a>) poisoning. Jugular venous distension, pulmonary crackles, and other signs of heart failure may be noted in some cases. Despite hypotension, CCB-poisoned patients may maintain a surprisingly clear mental status, possibly due to the neuroprotective effects of CCBs. However, neurologic status may deteriorate precipitously once cerebral perfusion becomes critically limited.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An electrocardiogram (ECG) should be obtained in patients with known or suspected calcium channel blocker (CCB) intoxication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blocker-poisoning/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. ECG changes associated with CCB intoxication include PR interval prolongation and any bradydysrhythmia. A finger stick blood glucose measurement may reveal hyperglycemia, which is caused by inhibition of calcium-mediated insulin release; however, this elevation is rarely clinically significant, except for diagnostic purposes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blocker-poisoning/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. The presence of hyperglycemia in a non-diabetic patient may help to distinguish CCB from beta blocker poisoning. Serum toxicology can confirm coingestion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> or salicylates, which should be excluded in suicidal patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blocker-poisoning/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, calcium, and glucose concentrations should be assessed. A chest radiograph should be obtained if there are any signs of pulmonary edema, hypoxia, or respiratory distress. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General approach to drug poisoning in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11744693\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial resuscitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Circulation is the main focus of the treatment of calcium channel blockers (CCB) exposures. Hypotension and bradycardia can be profound and refractory even to maximal treatment. Intravenous fluids are the initial therapy for hypotension, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a> the initial treatment for bradycardia, but both may be insufficient.</p><p>CCB-poisoned patients may maintain a clear mental status despite hypotension and bradycardia. However, clinicians need to reassess these patients <strong>frequently</strong>, as precipitous deterioration is common, and many will eventually require intubation and mechanical ventilation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11744580\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to the selection of specific therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although it is ideal to institute treatments individually to assess their success or failure, this is often not possible in patients who are severely poisoned with calcium channel blockers (CCBs), especially <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a>. These patients are frequently moribund on presentation, but even when initially well-appearing may deteriorate rapidly and disastrously. Our suggested approaches to therapy, based upon the severity of clinical signs, are described below; a summary table to facilitate emergent management is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63193\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63193 \">table 1</a>). Studies of therapies for CCB poisoning consist primarily of case series and animal studies, and thus, the approaches to treatment that we describe below are based upon limited evidence and our clinical experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blocker-poisoning/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11744587\"><span class=\"h3\">Severely symptomatic patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our suggested approach to patients manifesting signs of severe CCB poisoning (profound hypotension <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bradycardia) consists of multiple <strong>simultaneous</strong> interventions, including <strong>all</strong> of the following treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blocker-poisoning/abstract/4,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stabilization of the airway as necessary (avoid induction agents that exacerbate hypotension)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional IV boluses of isotonic crystalloid</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IV calcium salts</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glucagon</a></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IV high-dose insulin and glucose</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IV vasopressor (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norepinephrine-noradrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norepinephrine</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IV lipid emulsion therapy</p><p/><p>Dosing for each of these therapies is provided below.

However, these therapies often do not reverse the cardiotoxic effects of CCB poisoning. In such cases, we add the following treatments in succession based upon patient response. As an example, we begin treatment with a calcium salt if IV crystalloid is ineffective, but if hypotension resolves following treatment with a calcium salt, we do <strong>not</strong> proceed to IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glucagon</a> or any other treatment.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IV boluses of isotonic crystalloid</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IV calcium salts</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glucagon</a></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IV high-dose insulin and glucose</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IV vasopressor (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norepinephrine-noradrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norepinephrine</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IV lipid emulsion therapy</p><p/><p>A period of 15 minutes is reasonable to determine the effectiveness of a specific therapy before proceeding to the next treatment.

Vagal stimulation from orogastric lavage may exacerbate CCB-induced hypotension and bradycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blocker-poisoning/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Activated charcoal (AC) should be administered to patients with CCB overdose, even if they are asymptomatic. AC is maximally effective if administered within one hour of ingestion, but patients with delayed presentation after CCB exposure may still benefit. Charcoal should be withheld in patients with a depressed mental status who may not be able to protect their airway, unless endotracheal intubation is performed first. AC is given as a single dose of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> for children up to the adult dose of 50 g.

If the history is in doubt, WBI may be delayed until the patient develops signs or symptoms of toxicity.

Atropine is administered in a dose of 0.5 to 1.0 mg intravenously every two to three minutes to a maximum of 3 mg. Pediatric dosing is 0.02 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> intravenously, with a minimum dose of 0.1 mg to avoid the paradoxical bradycardia that may result from very small doses of this medication.

In adults, calcium chloride, 10 to 20 mL of a 10 percent solution, can be administered over 10 minutes; if no effect is noted, the dose can be repeated up to four times approximately every 20 minutes. If calcium gluconate is used, the dose must be adjusted (30 to 60 mL of 10 percent calcium gluconate), as calcium gluconate has only one third the calcium of calcium chloride [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blocker-poisoning/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>A high-dose continuous infusion of calcium has been used anecdotally with success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blocker-poisoning/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]; we believe a reasonable infusion is 0.5 meq of <span class=\"nowrap\">calcium/kg</span> per hour (or 0.2 to 0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour of 10 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium chloride</a>; or 0.6 to 1.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour of 10 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium gluconate</a>). Close monitoring of the serum or ionized calcium concentration (measurements every two hours) and serial ECGs is necessary to avoid clinically significant hypercalcemia, which has been reported with intensive calcium therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blocker-poisoning/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hypercalcemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hypercalcemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypercalcemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypercalcemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Glucagon</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Glucagon</a> increases intracellular levels of cyclic AMP and, in animal models, has been shown to increase heart rate in calcium channel blocker toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blocker-poisoning/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, it has minimal effects on the mean arterial pressure. Glucagon has been effective in treating human cases of CCB toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blocker-poisoning/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>].</p><p>The dosing regimen for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glucagon</a> in the treatment of CCB has not been established in human clinical trials. For the adult patient, an initial 5 mg intravenous bolus is a reasonable start, and may be repeated twice at 10 minute intervals. A glucagon infusion can be started at the total dose at which a response is noted. Nausea and vomiting are common side effects of this medication.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Vasopressors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ideal vasopressor in CCB poisoning would be a direct-acting agent with positive inotropy, positive chronotropy, and vasoconstrictive effects. Based on these criteria, we believe that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norepinephrine-noradrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norepinephrine</a> is the initial vasopressor of choice. We start the infusion at a rate of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/minute,</span> but titrate rapidly upwards with the goal of achieving a mean arterial pressure of 65 mmHg. Check the blood pressure every few minutes, increasing the infusion liberally (one reasonable approach is 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/minute</span> increments) if hypotension persists.</p><p>In patients who remain hypotensive at maximal doses of an initial vasopressor, we suggest the addition of a second vasopressor. Invasive hemodynamic monitoring (with a pulmonary artery catheter) or echocardiography may point to a selective failure of inotropy or vascular resistance, thus helping to refine the choice of catecholamine and the titration rate. We believe that such information is particularly important to guide the choice of a second agent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-artery-catheterization-interpretation-of-hemodynamic-values-and-waveforms-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary artery catheterization: Interpretation of hemodynamic values and waveforms in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiographic-assessment-of-the-right-heart\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Echocardiographic assessment of the right heart&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with profound CCB toxicity may require higher doses of vasopressors than those typically used in the treatment of severe sepsis or other causes of shock. In one series, patients with severe <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> toxicity received vasopressor doses as high as 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/minute</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norepinephrine-noradrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norepinephrine</a>, 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/minute</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>, and 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> per minute for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blocker-poisoning/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, the arrhythmogenic effects of these drugs become more prominent at higher doses and thus the risk of such high doses, particularly with multiple agents, may outweigh the benefits. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-vasopressors-and-inotropes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of vasopressors and inotropes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Insulin and glucose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High-dose insulin therapy has positive inotropic effects in patients with CCB toxicity.

For patients with a serum glucose concentration below 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (8.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> we administer 50 mL of 50 percent dextrose (D50W) intravenously (IV). In young children the initial dose of dextrose is 0.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> body weight, usually given as 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of 10 percent dextrose solution (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-hypoglycemia-in-infants-and-children#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to hypoglycemia in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>).

Following this bolus, we begin a continuous infusion at 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> per hour IV and titrate upwards until hypotension is corrected or a maximum dose of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> per hour is reached. One approach is to increase the infusion rate by 50 percent every 20 minutes until either target is met. High doses of insulin may be necessary and are appropriate in some cases, and the accepted range is 1 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> per hour given IV of regular, short-acting insulin. Even higher doses may be given under the direction of a medical toxicologist or poison control center. </p><p>CCB overdose often causes hyperglycemia that is refractory to high dose insulin. Therefore, not all patients require supplemental dextrose. Nevertheless, if necessary, euglycemia can be maintained by means of a continuous IV infusion of 5 to 10 percent dextrose. A reasonable initial rate for such an infusion is 0.5 to 1 g of <span class=\"nowrap\">dextrose/kg</span> per hour. Titration of the dextrose infusion and additional boluses of 50 percent dextrose are provided based upon serum glucose measurements (finger stick glucose), which are obtained every 15 to 30 minutes until the concentration is stable, and every hour thereafter until several hours after therapy is complete. </p><p>The serum potassium concentration is measured every 30 minutes until it is stable, and every one to two hours thereafter. Supplementation is given as necessary to maintain a potassium concentration in the low normal range. Magnesium replacement is often needed in hypokalemic patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-hypokalemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and treatment of hypokalemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A hemodynamic response to high-dose insulin therapy is delayed for 30 to 60 minutes; therefore, simultaneous implementation of other therapies to support the patient's pulse and blood pressure are generally required.</p><p>Animal studies of CCB toxicity have shown improved survival associated with <span class=\"nowrap\">hyperinsulinemia/euglycemia</span> therapy compared with calcium, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glucagon</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blocker-poisoning/abstract/26,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,30</a>]. Clinical experience with this approach is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blocker-poisoning/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]; in one case series of four verapamil-poisoned patients, <span class=\"nowrap\">hyperinsulinemia/euglycemia</span> therapy improved blood pressure and ejection fraction without changing heart rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blocker-poisoning/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. High-dose insulin therapy is also used in beta blocker poisoning. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-blocker-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Beta blocker poisoning&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The mechanism by which hyperinsulinemia-euglycemia therapy works remains unclear, though there are several theories. Though the mechanism is not completely understood, CCBs appear to disrupt fatty acid metabolism and create relative insulin resistance within the myocardium. This state of carbohydrate dependence and insulin resistance can theoretically be overcome with high-dose insulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blocker-poisoning/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. In addition, calcium is needed to facilitate exocytosis of insulin from the beta-islet cells of the pancreas. CCBs block the influx of calcium and prevent insulin release from the beta-islet cells. High-dose insulin therapy is thought to compensate for this impaired secretion of insulin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6162826\"><span class=\"h3\">Lipid emulsion therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lipid emulsions are the fats used in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a> (TPN). Initially used to treat overdoses of local anesthetics, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a>, intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) is being studied as a therapy for poisonings involving a number of lipophilic medications. Studies of ILE therapy are preliminary. Systematic reviews of lipid emulsion therapy for acute poisoning have found the overall quality of studies supporting this treatment to be low or very low but included human case reports provide some evidence of benefit in patients with toxicity from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a>, beta blockers, some tricyclic antidepressants, bupivacaine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorpromazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorpromazine</a>, and some antidysrhythmics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flecainide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flecainide</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blocker-poisoning/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. ILE may have a useful role in the treatment of patients who are hemodynamically unstable from such poisonings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blocker-poisoning/abstract/36-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-39</a>].</p><p>We suggest consultation with a medical toxicologist or poison control center to determine whether ILE therapy is appropriate. The dosing protocol most widely reported consists of an intravenous bolus of 1 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> given over one minute of a 20 percent lipid emulsion solution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blocker-poisoning/abstract/36,37,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37,40</a>]. If there is no response, the same dose may be repeated in cases of cardiac arrest every three to five minutes, for a total of three bolus doses. Following the initial bolus, an infusion is started at a rate of 0.25 to 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per minute until hemodynamic recovery occurs. The infusion is generally maintained for 30 to 60 minutes. The infusion rate may be increased if the patient&rsquo;s blood pressure drops. </p><p>Possible adverse effects from standard ILE treatment include hypertriglyceridemia, fat embolism, infection, and hypersensitivity reactions. Although these and other potential complications from ILE treatment have been reported, further study is needed to determine the risk of complications from circumscribed treatment in the setting of acute overdose. </p><p>ILE therapy interferes with some laboratory measurements and may affect therapeutic drug monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blocker-poisoning/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. As examples, serum glucose concentrations when determined by colorimetric testing and serum magnesium concentrations become inaccurate following the administration of ILE, while creatinine and lipase become unmeasurable. Potassium and troponin-I are not affected. Centrifugation of blood samples substantially reduces any interference.</p><p>Two mechanisms are believed to account for the effectiveness of ILE. The first is that the emulsion acts as a &ldquo;lipid sink,&rdquo; surrounding a lipophilic drug molecule and rendering it ineffective. The second is that the fatty acids from the ILE provide the myocardium with a ready energy source, thereby improving cardiac function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blocker-poisoning/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Phosphodiesterase inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phosphodiesterases inhibitors, such as inamrinone (formerly known as amrinone) increase cyclic AMP levels by preventing intracellular degradation of cyclic AMP.

We recommend that inamrinone not be considered unless therapy with a readily titratable vasopressor has been instituted, and a pulmonary artery catheter is in place to help guide management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-vasopressors-and-inotropes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of vasopressors and inotropes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7156442\"><span class=\"h3\">Other proposed treatments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some have proposed levosimendan as a treatment for CCB poisoning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blocker-poisoning/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. However, studies of levosimendan are limited and we do <strong>not</strong> recommend its use for this purpose. Levosimendan sensitizes the calcium channels and promotes the influx of calcium into the cell. Theoretically this would appear beneficial in a calcium channel blocker overdose, but results from animal models are conflicting and the drug has some phosphodiesterase activity which may exacerbate hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blocker-poisoning/abstract/45-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Invasive treatment measures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A transvenous pacemaker can be inserted to assist with electrical conduction.
