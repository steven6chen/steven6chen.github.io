The relative benefits and risks to the mother and fetus of using a particular medication to maintain disease control or to treat active disease during pregnancy depend upon the specific clinical context and may be influenced by gestational age and other factors. Importantly, untreated disease carries its own risks to both the mother and the developing fetus.</p><p>The risks of antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive medications in pregnancy and during lactation that are used for the treatment of rheumatic diseases will be reviewed here. Additional information regarding each medication is provided in the drug information topic for each agent. Approaches to the therapy of individual conditions are presented separately within the appropriate topic reviews on the treatment of given disorders, and for some conditions, in separate topic reviews. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rheumatoid-arthritis-and-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rheumatoid arthritis and pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-in-women-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy in women with systemic lupus erythematosus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Strategies for the preservation of fertility in patients undergoing cytotoxic therapy; cryopreservation of sperm, oocytes, and embryos; and the effects of antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive medications on male fertility are discussed in detail separately.

The previous letter categories inaccurately implied increased risk as one went from category A to B to C to D to X; in actuality, these categories were designed to reflect the amount and type of data available. The system that began implementation in mid-2015 provides a discussion of the available data regarding a particular drug's safety in pregnancy and lactation, as well as information regarding the risk of untreated disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-of-antiinflammatory-and-immunosuppressive-drugs-in-rheumatic-diseases-during-pregnancy-and-lactation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>For practical purposes, we divide the antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive medications used to treat inflammatory disorders into four categories, recognizing that there are differences in risks between medications in any category and that some drugs may fall into more than one category depending upon various factors. These categories are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimal fetal or maternal risk</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Selective use allowed during pregnancy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderate to high risk of fetal harm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unknown risk</p><p/><p>There is limited information regarding the toxicities and teratogenetic potential of many antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive medications in pregnant women because of the ethical issues involved in testing such drugs in the setting of pregnancy. For some medications, the available evidence is limited to or primarily from animal research.</p><p>Information related to the toxicity and teratogenicity of immunosuppressive medications in pregnant women must be interpreted in light of the background risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in all women. Major birth defects are defined as events of medical, surgical, or cosmetic significance. It is estimated that the prevalence of major birth defects is 2 to 4 percent among liveborn infants. This prevalence does not vary among ethnic groups (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79937\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79937 \">table 1</a>). Evaluation of lactation risk often involves calculation of the relative infant dose (RID), which is the dose administered to the infant through breast milk in <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> divided by the maternal dose in <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span>. Estimates of less than 10 percent of the maternal dose are generally considered safe.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MINIMAL FETAL OR MATERNAL RISK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following medications are viewed as relatively safe in pregnancy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Hydroxychloroquine</a> (HCQ) (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Hydroxychloroquine'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sulfasalazine</a> (SSZ) (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Sulfasalazine'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> (see <a href=\"#H2995214370\" class=\"local\">'Aspirin (low-dose)'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Hydroxychloroquine</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pregnancy</strong> &ndash; HCQ can be continued during pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lactation</strong> &ndash; HCQ use is compatible with breastfeeding.</p><p/><p>HCQ is an antimalarial agent that is effective in the treatment of several rheumatic diseases.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimalarial drugs in the treatment of rheumatic disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>HCQ is stored in tissues, particularly the liver, and has a half-life of approximately eight weeks. Thus, unless pregnancy is planned, fetal exposure cannot be avoided by discontinuing the medication at the time the pregnancy is discovered.</p><p>HCQ crosses the placenta. However, there does not appear to be fetal toxicity with HCQ doses used for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or other rheumatic diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-of-antiinflammatory-and-immunosuppressive-drugs-in-rheumatic-diseases-during-pregnancy-and-lactation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In a retrospective series of 257 pregnancies from the Johns Hopkins Lupus Cohort, the pregnancies were divided into three groups: mothers with no HCQ exposure during pregnancy (n = 163), those in whom HCQ was used continuously (n = 56), and those in whom HCQ was stopped during the first trimester or within three months of conception (n = 38) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-of-antiinflammatory-and-immunosuppressive-drugs-in-rheumatic-diseases-during-pregnancy-and-lactation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The following observations were made:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There were no differences in the three groups in terms of miscarriages, stillbirths, pregnancy losses, and congenital abnormalities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SLE flares were more common, and the mean <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> doses were higher, among the women who stopped taking HCQ during pregnancy.

During a mean of 26 months' follow-up of the children resulting from these pregnancies, there was no difference in the rate of growth, and there was no evidence of visual or developmental abnormalities.</p><p/><p>HCQ is transferred to human breast milk: breastfed infants are exposed to approximately 2 percent of the maternal dose, which is well within levels considered to be safe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-of-antiinflammatory-and-immunosuppressive-drugs-in-rheumatic-diseases-during-pregnancy-and-lactation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Concomitant folate supplementation is advised, and the dose of SSZ should not exceed 2 g per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-of-antiinflammatory-and-immunosuppressive-drugs-in-rheumatic-diseases-during-pregnancy-and-lactation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

However, women taking SSZ should avoid breastfeeding premature infants or those with hyperbilirubinemia or glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.</p><p/><p>SSZ possesses both antiinflammatory properties mediated by its 5-aminosalicylic acid moiety and antibacterial characteristics associated with its sulfapyridine moiety. Specific details regarding the use and monitoring of this medication are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-and-5-aminosalicylates-in-the-treatment-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sulfasalazine and 5-aminosalicylates in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-pharmacology-administration-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sulfasalazine: Pharmacology, administration, and adverse effects in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>SSZ has been used since its development in the 1940s as an agent for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Most of the information regarding the use of this medication during pregnancy is gleaned from its effects on patients with IBD.</p><p>SSZ and its metabolite sulfapyridine cross the placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-of-antiinflammatory-and-immunosuppressive-drugs-in-rheumatic-diseases-during-pregnancy-and-lactation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, neither SSZ nor sulfapyridine causes significant displacement of bilirubin from albumin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-of-antiinflammatory-and-immunosuppressive-drugs-in-rheumatic-diseases-during-pregnancy-and-lactation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Thus, SSZ use by pregnant women does not appear to increase the risk of kernicterus.</p><p>Birth defects have been recorded in several case reports of patients treated with SSZ. Reported congenital anomalies include reports of cleft lip and palate, hydrocephalus, macrocephaly, ventricular septal defect, and a coarctation of the aorta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-of-antiinflammatory-and-immunosuppressive-drugs-in-rheumatic-diseases-during-pregnancy-and-lactation/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. A large, multicenter, case-control study reported teratogenic effects of dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors (SSZ and five other agents) taken during the first trimester, including cardiovascular defects (relative risk [RR] 3.4, 95% CI 1.8-6.4) and oral clefts (RR 2.6, 95% CI 1.1-6.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-of-antiinflammatory-and-immunosuppressive-drugs-in-rheumatic-diseases-during-pregnancy-and-lactation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Maternal use of multivitamins with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> (0.4 mg daily) reduced the risk.</p><p>However, case series of patients have shown no increased incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-of-antiinflammatory-and-immunosuppressive-drugs-in-rheumatic-diseases-during-pregnancy-and-lactation/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].

Glucocorticoid use later in pregnancy increases the risk of gestational diabetes and pregnancy-induced hypertension. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be used from the beginning of the second trimester to week 30 of gestation.
