LTCFs include nursing homes, skilled-nursing facilities providing postacute care, assisted living facilities, retirement homes, rehabilitation centers, long-term care hospitals, long-term psychiatric facilities, and institutions for individuals with intellectual disabilities. For many residents, these facilities are a home as well as a place of nursing, medical, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> psychosocial care.</p><p>The Association for Practitioners in Infection Control and the Society for Hospital Epidemiology have developed guidelines for infection prevention and control in LTCFs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-infection-control-in-long-term-care-facilities/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Staffing and support for infection control in LTCFs lag behind infection control programs in acute care hospitals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-infection-control-in-long-term-care-facilities/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>]. Challenges to infection control in LTCFs include high patient-staff ratios, high staff turnover, and inadequate implementation of infection control policies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-infection-control-in-long-term-care-facilities/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Issues related to infection prevention and control in LTCFs will be reviewed here. Causes of infection in LTCFs facilities are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-infection-in-long-term-care-facilities-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of infection in long-term care facilities: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The United States population &gt;65 years and over increased from 36.6 million to 47.8 million between 2005 and 2015 and is projected to increase to 98 million by 2060. Around 3 percent of the population &gt;65 years in the United States lived in institutional settings in 2015. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-infection-control-in-long-term-care-facilities/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The incidence of hospital-acquired infections in LTCFs is comparable with that in acute care hospitals and ranges from 1.8 to 13.5 infections per 1000 resident-days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-infection-control-in-long-term-care-facilities/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Infections contribute to 63 percent of deaths in LTCFs and are the primary reason for 25 to 50 percent of transfers to acute care hospitals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-infection-control-in-long-term-care-facilities/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The most common infections are urinary tract infection (3.0 to 5.2 percent), pneumonia (2.2 to 4.4 percent), and cellulitis (1.6 to 2.0 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-infection-control-in-long-term-care-facilities/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Residents of LTCFs are at risk for infections circulating in the community as well as healthcare-associated infections. Risk factors for infection include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Underlying medical illness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of medications that suppress the immune system or the central nervous system</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factors promoting person-to-person transmission such as close living quarters and sharing of meals</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depressed mental state</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Protracted use of devices such as urinary catheters and nasogastric tubes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incontinence</p><p/><p>Multidrug-resistant organisms (methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus, </em>vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria) are increasingly important causes of colonization and infection in LTCFs. Tools for control include standard and isolation precautions as well as antimicrobial stewardship. (See <a href=\"#H7474320\" class=\"local\">'Standard precautions'</a> below and <a href=\"#H7475987\" class=\"local\">'Antimicrobial stewardship'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">ELEMENTS OF INFECTION CONTROL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Long-term care facilities (LTCFs) should have a designated infection control practitioner and multidisciplinary oversight group (including facility administrator, medical director, clinical staff, and local health department). Other important components of infection control include written infection control policies and procedures as well as protocols for detecting, treating, containing, and preventing transmission of potential pathogens. Infection control programs for LTCFs should be tailored to the type of facility, the layout of the facility (including isolation facilities and adequate availability of sinks for handwashing), the risk factors among the residents, and available resources.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Surveillance for infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surveillance is important for detection of outbreaks, changes in infection rates, and other issues requiring infection control intervention (including the need for additional training or staff education) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-infection-control-in-long-term-care-facilities/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. The components of a surveillance system include a mechanism for data collection, a schedule and procedure for evaluation of data, dissemination of results, and mechanisms for action and follow-up. Monitoring of disease patterns over time may provide information on the effectiveness of changes in infection control practices and policies.</p><p>The scope of surveillance depends on the type of facility and available resources. Facility-wide surveillance provides information on the burden of infection and detects outbreaks, whereas targeted surveillance focuses on preventable infections with significant morbidity, requires fewer resources than facility-wide surveillance, and can be used to monitor targeted interventions to improve patient safety. Each facility should have a specific surveillance plan that includes the type of surveillance to be undertaken, the form of data collection, and the frequency of data reporting.</p><p>Surveillance data can be collected via periodic review of charts, laboratory reports, and other records. In addition, regular conversations with nursing staff and residents and clinical observations are important components of surveillance data collection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-infection-control-in-long-term-care-facilities/abstract/1,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12</a>]. Surveillance of adherence to infection control measures (such as hand hygiene compliance, catheter care, and employee and patient immunization rates) is also an important component of infection control. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of infection'</a> below.)</p><p>The frequency of data review depends upon the size and the nature of the facility. Larger facilities should examine data at least weekly, while smaller facilities can use a biweekly or monthly interval. As an example, a facility managing patients on ventilators has substantially different needs for surveillance than one with residents predominantly with dementia. Data evaluation should include detection of sentinel events, such as identification of a resident with crusted scabies or detection of new diarrheal illness among residents of the same unit within one week. More subtle trends (such as an increase in respiratory tract infections) are best detected by comparisons with previous weeks or months. Information on trends should be provided back to units and employees, with plans for action and follow-up. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-infection-in-long-term-care-facilities-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of infection in long-term care facilities: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Calculating crude infection rates (number of cases divided by patient census) is useful for identifying outbreaks within a facility, while calculation of risk-adjusted infection rates is most accurate for comparison of infection rates between facilities. It may be useful to express infection rates in terms of specific exposure (for example, calculation of infection associated with urinary catheter should use the number catheter-days) rather than an overall census denominator. One method for inter-facility comparison of infection rates created a standardized regional data set to provide an external benchmark for inter-facility comparisons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-infection-control-in-long-term-care-facilities/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Outbreaks may be defined as an unusual increase in illness above baseline levels; outbreak surveillance and control should be a high priority. Issues to be considered in an outbreak management plan include developing a case definition, case finding, analyzing the outbreak, formulating a hypothesis regarding transmission, and designing and evaluating control measures. The Society for Hospital Epidemiology guidelines may assist in creating an outbreak management plant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-infection-control-in-long-term-care-facilities/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Common causes of outbreaks in LTCFs include respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. In some instances, a single case may be sufficient to prompt an infection control response; examples include influenza, tuberculosis, meningococcal meningitis, <em>Legionella</em> infection, norovirus, salmonellosis, group A streptococcal soft tissue infection, viral hepatitis, scabies, and infection with antibiotic-resistant pathogens. In the setting of diarrhea, consideration of the likely cause should influence the infection control response; diarrhea associated with tube feeding requires care of individual patient, while a cluster of residents with vomiting and diarrhea requires a vigorous infection control response for diagnosis and prevention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-infection-in-long-term-care-facilities-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of infection in long-term care facilities: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention of infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Effective implementation of preventive measures is critical for infection control in LTCFs. These include use of appropriate contact precautions in the setting of patient care, careful attention to hand hygiene, administration of immunizations to residents, and antimicrobial stewardship [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-infection-control-in-long-term-care-facilities/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17367756\"><span class=\"h3\">Residents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At the time of admission, each resident should have a complete history, review of immunization history, and physical examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-infection-control-in-long-term-care-facilities/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The three most important vaccines for older adult residents of LTCFs are influenza vaccine, pneumococcal vaccine, and tetanus-diphtheria toxoid vaccination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-infection-control-in-long-term-care-facilities/abstract/1,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Influenza vaccine is effective in older adult persons and should be given annually.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-for-health-care-providers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations for health care providers&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Training of healthcare workers is critical to effective infection control in LTCFs. Training should be formal and informal, sufficiently frequent to address needs arising from staff turnover, and should be readily understandable by all employees. Orientation for healthcare workers should include hand hygiene, modes of transmission of infection, assessment of residents for infection, and environmental cleaning. In addition, employees should report significant communicable symptoms (including cough, rash, or diarrhea) and should not have contact with residents while potentially infectious. Written procedures and guidelines should be developed addressing these topics.</p><p>Education on precautions to reduce the risk of transmission of bloodborne pathogens should be offered, and there should be an established mechanism for access to appropriate postexposure prophylaxis in the setting of bodily fluid exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-infection-control-in-long-term-care-facilities/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations about management of visitor access include hand hygiene, use of personal protective equipment while visiting residents on precautions, and limited movement within the facility. Visitors with respiratory symptoms should wear masks and avoid contact with other residents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-infection-control-in-long-term-care-facilities/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. During an outbreak of transmissible infection (such as influenza), it may be prudent to restrict visitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-infection-control-in-long-term-care-facilities/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H331295142\"><span class=\"h2\">Precautions</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7474320\"><span class=\"h3\">Standard precautions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Standard precautions that should be employed with all patients include hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette, safe injection practices, and use of gloves, gowns, masks, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> eye protection if contact with mucous membranes, non-intact skin, or body fluids is anticipated.</p><p>Hand hygiene is the single <strong>most</strong> important infection control measure. Hand hygiene refers to either handwashing with soap and water or the use of alcohol-based gels or foams that do not require the use of water. Hand hygiene should be performed by staff and visitors before and after each contact with a patient or surroundings, before aseptic procedures, and after contact with blood or body fluids.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H331295023\"><span class=\"h3\">Isolation precautions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Isolation precautions for certain pathogens are summarized in the Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50001\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50001 \">table 1</a>).
