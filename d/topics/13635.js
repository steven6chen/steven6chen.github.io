In almost all infants, these changes are successfully completed at delivery without requiring any special assistance. However, about 10 percent of infants will need some intervention, and less than 1 percent will require extensive resuscitative measures at birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-transition-from-intrauterine-to-extrauterine-life/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The physiologic changes that occur in the transition from intrauterine to extrauterine life are reviewed here. The indications and principles of neonatal resuscitation are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-resuscitation-in-the-delivery-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal resuscitation in the delivery room&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">FETUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to delivery, the human fetus depends upon the placenta for gas and nutrient exchange with the maternal circulation. A discussion on the development of the placenta, which is essential for normal fetal growth and development, is found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placental-development-and-physiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placental development and physiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The low vascular resistance of the placenta and the high vascular resistance of the fluid-filled fetal lungs result in right-to-left shunts characteristic of the fetal circulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F66765\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66765 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal circulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the fetus, the placenta has the lowest vascular resistance and receives 40 percent of the fetal cardiac output, which results in a low systemic pressure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F66765\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66765 \">figure 1</a>). In contrast, the fetal lungs are filled with fluid, resulting in a high vascular resistance and less than 10 percent of the cardiac output going to the lungs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70458\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef70458 \">algorithm 1</a>). In contrast to earlier studies in lambs, subsequent studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and Doppler ultrasound to measure fetal blood flow suggest pulmonary blood flow may be higher (11 to 15 percent of combined ventricular output) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-transition-from-intrauterine-to-extrauterine-life/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Two right-to-left shunts occur in the fetus because of the high pulmonary vascular resistance and low systemic pressure:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Foramen ovale &minus; Blood shunted from the right to left atrium</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ductus arteriosus &minus; Blood shunted from the pulmonary artery to the aorta</p><p/><p>From the placenta, oxygenated blood flows through the umbilical vein and splits upon entering the abdomen of the fetus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F66765\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66765 \">figure 1</a>). The majority flows through the ductus venosus into the inferior vena cava, and then the right atrium; the remaining blood perfuses the liver. Blood originating from the ductus venosus enters the right atrium and, because of a streaming effect, is largely shunted through the foramen ovale into the left side of the heart and aorta. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Fetal oxygenation'</a> below.)</p><p>In contrast, less oxygenated blood from the superior vena cava and the inferior vena cava distal to the ductus venous flows from the right atrium into the right ventricle with minimal mixing with the oxygenated blood originating from the ductus venosus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F66765\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66765 \">figure 1</a>). Almost all of the right ventricular output (90 percent) bypasses the lung and is shunted through the patent ductus arteriosus to the descending aorta distal to the origin of the carotid arteries. This deoxygenated blood is transported through the aorta and the umbilical arteries to the placenta, where it releases carbon dioxide and waste products and collects oxygen and nutrients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal oxygenation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The intrauterine oxygen tension is low compared with that seen in extrauterine life. The highest oxygenated fetal blood is found in the umbilical vein with PO<sub>2</sub> as high as 55&plusmn;7 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-transition-from-intrauterine-to-extrauterine-life/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Oxygen saturation decreases when mixed with venous return, so that blood returning to the placenta will have a PO<sub>2</sub> of 15 to 25 mmHg.</p><p>Despite the low oxygen tension in the fetus, there is adequate tissue oxygenation because of the following factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-transition-from-intrauterine-to-extrauterine-life/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetal hemoglobin &minus; Fetal hemoglobin has increased oxygen affinity compared with adult hemoglobin, which facilitates oxygen transport across the placenta. The high affinity of fetal hemoglobin may result in up to 80 percent saturation, a level that promotes sufficient oxygen transport across the placenta to meet the metabolic needs of the fetus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased fetal oxygen consumption &minus; Intrauterine compared with extrauterine life requires less oxygen because fetal metabolism and oxygen consumption are decreased:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The fetus does not need to maintain thermoregulation because the thermal environment is maintained by the mother.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In the fetus, many physiologic functions are reduced, including respiratory effort, gastrointestinal digestion and absorption, and renal tubular reabsorption (due to the low glomerular filtration rate). These changes reduce tissue oxygen consumption.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Differential blood flow &minus; In the fetus, the blood flow is structured so that vital organs (eg, liver, heart, and brain) receive blood with a relatively high degree of oxygen saturation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F66765\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66765 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Liver &minus; The liver receives blood directly from the umbilical vein without mixing with deoxygenated fetal blood.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Brain and heart &minus; Blood flowing through the coronary and carotid arteries has a high degree of oxygen saturation because oxygenated blood from the umbilical vein flows to the right atrium (via the ductus venosus and inferior vena cava) and is shunted through the foramen ovale to the left side of the heart and aorta. This shunting is achieved through differential velocities of incoming venous blood streams and directing of oxygenated blood to the foramen ovale. This reduces mixing of oxygenated blood with deoxygenated blood entering the right atrium from the superior vena cava. The deoxygenated blood is directed toward the right ventricle and shunted through the ductus arteriosus to the aorta, but distal to the origin of the carotid and coronary arteries.</p><p/><p>The low fetal oxygen tension maintains the architecture of the fetal circulation by causing pulmonary vascular constriction, which maintains pulmonary vascular resistance at a high level, thereby promoting right-to-left shunting through the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSITION AT DELIVERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To successfully make the transition from intrauterine to extrauterine life when the umbilical cord is clamped at birth, the neonate must rapidly make physiologic changes in cardiopulmonary function. A successful transition is characterized by the following features:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alveolar fluid clearance</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung expansion </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Circulatory changes with increases in pulmonary perfusion and systemic pressure, and closure of the right-to-left shunts of the fetal circulation</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Alveolar fluid clearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several mechanisms contribute to the clearance of alveolar fluid and lung aeration, including labor, initial breaths, and thoracic squeeze.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Labor &minus; Studies in lamb models have helped elucidate a better understanding of the regulation of alveolar fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-transition-from-intrauterine-to-extrauterine-life/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Chloride-driven liquid secretion predominates during gestation, which stretches the lung and promotes lung growth and development. During late gestation, in response to increased concentrations of catecholamines and other hormones, the lung epithelium switches from active secretion of chloride and liquid into the air spaces to active resorption of sodium and liquid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-transition-from-intrauterine-to-extrauterine-life/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Increased oxygen tension at birth enhances the capacity of the epithelium to transport sodium and increases gene expression of the epithelial sodium channel, promoting further resorption of alveolar fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-transition-from-intrauterine-to-extrauterine-life/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial breaths &minus; The initial effective breaths of the neonate generate high transpulmonary pressures: mean esophageal pressures of -52 cm H<sub>2</sub>O during inspiration and 71 cm H<sub>2</sub>O during expiration have been measured in term infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-transition-from-intrauterine-to-extrauterine-life/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The initial negative hydrostatic pressure drives alveolar fluid from the air spaces into the interstitium and subsequently the pulmonary vasculature.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thoracic squeeze &minus; Although once thought to be the primary mechanism for alveolar clearance, the pressure upon the chest wall of the infant during delivery probably is only a minor contributor to alveolar fluid clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-transition-from-intrauterine-to-extrauterine-life/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p>In a study of infants (gestational age &ge;35 weeks), lung aeration and partial liquid clearance were achieved in the first few minutes after birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-transition-from-intrauterine-to-extrauterine-life/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Complete airway clearance was observed in 49, 78, and 100 percent of infants at 2, 4, and 24 hours after delivery. However, no clinical or radiographic information was provided.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Lung expansion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With the first effective breath, air movement begins as intrathoracic pressure falls, starting at pressures of less than -5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. Increasing inspiratory pressure expands the alveolar air spaces and establishes functional residual capacity (FRC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-transition-from-intrauterine-to-extrauterine-life/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Lung expansion also stimulates surfactant release, which reduces alveolar surface tension, increases compliance, and stabilizes the FRC.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Circulatory changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With the clamping of the umbilical cord, the placenta with its low vascular resistance is removed from the neonatal circulation, resulting in a rise in neonatal systemic blood pressure. At the same time, lung expansion reduces both pulmonary vascular resistance and the pulmonary artery pressure.</p><p>These two changes decrease the fetal right-to-left shunt at the ductus arteriosus, resulting in an increasing left-to-right shunt at the ductus arteriosus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-transition-from-intrauterine-to-extrauterine-life/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. These two changes also result in an increased blood flow through the pulmonary arteries and lungs. This shift to left-to-right shunting after delivery results in an increase in ventricular stroke volume, which is associated with an increase in cerebral oxygen saturation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiologic-transition-from-intrauterine-to-extrauterine-life/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. With increased lung perfusion and expansion, neonatal oxygenation saturation is increased, which stimulates closure of the ductus arteriosus.</p><p>In addition, the increased pulmonary arterial blood flow raises pulmonary venous return to the left atrium and left atrial pressure. As the left atrial pressure increases and the right atrial pressure falls, right-to-left shunting across the foramen ovale decreases. Closure of the foramen ovale occurs when the left atrial pressure exceeds the right atrial pressure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although most neonates successfully transition between intrauterine and extrauterine life, about 10 percent will have some difficulty and require resuscitative efforts at birth.

Poor or absent spontaneous respiratory effort suggests that the infant is neurologically depressed (usually brain asphyxia) or has impaired muscular function. Causes of impaired respiratory effort vary from benign and readily reversible problems (eg, exposure to maternally administered opioids) to more severe and refractory problems (eg, severe and prolonged hypoxia or congenital neuromuscular disorder).
