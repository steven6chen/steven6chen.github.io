(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular genetics of chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Imatinib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dasatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dasatinib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nilotinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nilotinib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bosutinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bosutinib</a>, and radotinib are tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that can be used for initial treatment of CML. However, even with TKI therapy, CML can progress from a relatively indolent disease (chronic stable phase) to a more aggressive disorder (accelerated phase), during which time disease control is more difficult to achieve. It can then culminate in an acute leukemia, termed &quot;blast crisis,&quot; which is generally refractory to treatment.</p><p>The initial treatment of chronic phase (CP) CML will be discussed here. Treatment of CP-CML after the failure of initial therapy, treatment of accelerated phase and blast crisis, and specific details regarding the pharmacology of tyrosine kinase inhibitors are discussed separately.

However, as TKIs have demonstrated long-term disease control and good tolerability, few patients choose to pursue allogeneic HCT as initial therapy. Instead, they are treated with TKIs and careful follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-chronic-phase/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Allogeneic HCT remains a principal therapeutic option for patients who develop resistance or intolerance to TKIs. Outcomes with HCT and TKIs have not been directly compared in a well-designed trial. However, historic comparisons have noted that HCT is associated with increased short- and long-term morbidity and mortality, despite the possibility of cure. Thus, allogeneic HCT is rarely offered as initial therapy.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Imatinib</a> was the first TKI available for the treatment of patients with CP CML [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-chronic-phase/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Initial reports from randomized trials have demonstrated that more potent, second generation TKIs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dasatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dasatinib</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nilotinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nilotinib</a>) produce faster and deeper responses than imatinib [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-chronic-phase/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. However, the clinical significance of these endpoints is unclear, as patients on imatinib could &quot;catch up&quot; in subsequent years, and there is no difference in survival. These randomized studies also noted an increased rate of progression to accelerated phase or blast crisis in the imatinib-treated patients in the first year. However, progression was seen in only 3 to 4 percent of imatinib-treated patients and there is no information available on the fate of these patients or the possibility of salvage treatment with a second generation TKI.</p><p>Further follow-up is needed to confirm whether the short-term improvements seen with second generation TKIs will result in longer term benefits, such as improved survival. A choice among agents should take into consideration the drug side effect profiles and the patient's comorbidities.

Outcomes with HCT and tyrosine kinase inhibitors have not been directly compared in a well-designed trial. However, based on historical comparisons, HCT is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, despite the possibility of cure. Thus, allogeneic HCT is currently not offered as initial therapy, except in rare circumstances.</p><p>With HCT, the probability of survival can be predicted with reasonable accuracy using a scoring system devised by the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F67260\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67260 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-chronic-phase/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].
