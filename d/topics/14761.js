With sudden pulling on the distal radius, a portion of the annular ligament slips over the head of the radius and slides into the radiohumeral joint, where it becomes trapped (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52710\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52710 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F86688\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86688 \">figure 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radial-head-subluxation-nursemaids-elbow/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The symptoms of RHS are the result of displacement of the annular ligament. By the age of five years, the annular ligament has become thick and strong and is unlikely to tear or become displaced.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2793166693\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radial head subluxation (RHS) is a frequent elbow injury in young children, affecting approximately 20,000 children per year in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radial-head-subluxation-nursemaids-elbow/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. RHS typically occurs between the ages of one and four years, with toddlers one to three years of age accounting for over 80 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radial-head-subluxation-nursemaids-elbow/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], although cases have been reported in children younger than six months of age and as old as 11 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radial-head-subluxation-nursemaids-elbow/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Girls outnumber boys in most reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radial-head-subluxation-nursemaids-elbow/abstract/2,4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4-8</a>], and the left arm is more commonly injured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radial-head-subluxation-nursemaids-elbow/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. </p><p>Pulling on the arm, falls, and arm twisting are commonly reported mechanisms of injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radial-head-subluxation-nursemaids-elbow/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Mechanisms of RHS such as &quot;swinging&quot; the child by the arms, lifting the child, or wrestling may more often involve male caregivers while RHS caused by pulling away, tripping, or getting dressed appears to be more associated with female caregivers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radial-head-subluxation-nursemaids-elbow/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The caregiver typically reports that the child is not using the affected arm. Anecdotally, the child may also complain of poorly localized wrist, arm, or elbow pain. The classic mechanisms of a &quot;pull injury&quot; as a parent or caregiver grabs the arm to prevent the child from falling or pulling away is present in approximately 40 to 50 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radial-head-subluxation-nursemaids-elbow/abstract/2-5,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5,10</a>]. Radial head subluxation (RHS) also can occur when a child is swung by the forearms or during play. Other mechanisms include falling onto the elbow, minor direct trauma to the elbow, or a twisting motion of the arm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radial-head-subluxation-nursemaids-elbow/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Among children younger than six months of age, the injury typically involves rolling over in bed, which somehow traps the involved forearm under the body and results in longitudinal traction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radial-head-subluxation-nursemaids-elbow/abstract/3,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Examination should include inspection and palpation of the entire extremity, as well as the clavicle, on the affected side.</p><p>Children with RHS may hold the affected arm close to the body with the elbow either fully extended or slightly flexed and the forearm pronated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82235\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82235 \">figure 3</a>). The child is in little distress unless attempts are made to move the elbow. There may be mild tenderness over the anterolateral aspect of the radial head. However, the distal humerus and proximal ulna are usually nontender and not swollen. If the child reports wrist pain, there is no associated distal radial or ulna tenderness or swelling. </p><p>Passive range of motion of the elbow, if the child allows it, is normal. Pain with even mild supination of the forearm is almost always present.</p><p>RHS is <strong>not</strong> associated with bony tenderness, deformity, or swelling. These findings suggest other diagnoses, primarily fracture. (See <a href=\"#H2053492342\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radial head subluxation is a clinical diagnosis and radiologic investigation is usually <strong>not</strong> needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radial-head-subluxation-nursemaids-elbow/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>] and should be avoided to prevent unnecessary ionizing radiation in the child. </p><p>A thorough physical examination is critical before ordering radiologic imaging because positioning of the elbow to obtain radiographs may lead to reduction of the radial head subluxation. In equivocal cases, when the child has full range of motion of the arm without pain after radiographs are obtained, the diagnosis of RHS is confirmed. </p><p>Plain radiographs of the elbow to exclude fractures or dislocation may be appropriate in selected patients younger than five years of age with any one of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A concerning mechanism of injury (eg, direct blow or high force injury) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A physical examination that demonstrates swelling, other than over the anterolateral aspect of the radial head </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focal bony tenderness, or deformity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inability to successfully reduce a presumed RHS</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nondisplaced (type I) supracondylar fractures are the most commonly reported fracture in young children undergoing imaging during evaluation for RHS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radial-head-subluxation-nursemaids-elbow/abstract/13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15</a>].

However, based upon case reports, displacement of the normal radiocapitellar line (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79906\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79906 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63886\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63886 \">image 2</a>) may occasionally be seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radial-head-subluxation-nursemaids-elbow/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. </p><p>Preliminary observational studies suggest that, when performed by trained and experienced ultrasonographers, point of care ultrasound can identify displacement of the annular ligament, enlargement of the synovial fringe, or change in shape of the supinator muscle in children with RHS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radial-head-subluxation-nursemaids-elbow/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. However, point-of-care ultrasound is unnecessary to diagnose RHS in most children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of radial head subluxation (RHS) can be made when the characteristic history (ie, pulling on the arm) and examination findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82235\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82235 \">figure 3</a>) are present in a child younger than five years of age. The clinician should also ensure no focal bony tenderness, bruising, deformity, or swelling suggestive of a fracture, especially over the distal humerus and proximal ulna. If performed, plain radiographs should show no signs of fracture or dislocation.</p><p>Even in the absence of the classic history, the diagnosis is likely when the examination is characteristic in younger children. However, the clinician should be wary of making the diagnosis of RHS in children older than five years and consider a broader differential diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2053492342\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children younger than five years of age with suspected radial head subluxation (RHS), fracture near the elbow represents the most important diagnosis to exclude. Most fractures of the upper extremity in young children arise from falls while pulling of the arm is an unusual fracture mechanism. Children with fractures typically have swelling, bony tenderness, or deformity on physical examination; all of these findings are usually absent in children with RHS. Plain radiographs of the affected region often demonstrate the fracture. However, children with Salter I physeal fractures may have normal radiographs that require repeat imaging in seven days to diagnose. These patients will have point tenderness over the physis at initial evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-fracture-management-fracture-patterns-and-description-in-children#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of fracture management: Fracture patterns and description in children&quot;, section on 'Physeal (growth plate)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-fracture-management-fracture-patterns-and-description-in-children#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of fracture management: Fracture patterns and description in children&quot;, section on 'Salter I (Ogden IA-C)'</a>.) </p><p>RHS is an uncommon cause of anterolateral elbow pain and limitation of motion in children older than five years of age. Such patients typically warrant radiographs after an acute injury to evaluate for fracture or dislocation and prior to attempts at reduction. In older patients with a more subacute presentation or who lack a specific history of injury, plain radiographs may demonstrate osteochondrosis of the capitellum (Panner disease) or osteochondritis dissecans. The differential diagnosis of older active children with anterior or lateral elbow pain is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=elbow-injuries-in-active-children-or-skeletally-immature-adolescents-approach#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Elbow injuries in active children or skeletally immature adolescents: Approach&quot;, section on 'Anterior elbow pain'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=elbow-injuries-in-active-children-or-skeletally-immature-adolescents-approach#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Elbow injuries in active children or skeletally immature adolescents: Approach&quot;, section on 'Lateral elbow pain'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Reduction</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11574304\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinically suspected radial head subluxation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most children with clinically suspected radial head subluxation (RHS) and no signs of other injury on physical examination should have reduction attempted without imaging. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.) </p><p/><p>We suggest that these patients undergo reduction by the hyperpronation method (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52541\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52541 \">figure 4</a>) rather than the <span class=\"nowrap\">supination/flexion</span> method (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81909\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81909 \">figure 5</a>). In a meta-analysis of eight randomized trials (811 children), successful reduction of RHS at the first attempt was more likely with hyperpronation than <span class=\"nowrap\">supination/flexion</span> (mean first attempt success rate, 91 versus 74 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radial-head-subluxation-nursemaids-elbow/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Based upon this analysis, the number needed to treat (NNT) is six, ie, six children would require treatment by the hyperpronation method rather than <span class=\"nowrap\">supination/flexion</span> to avoid one failed reduction on first attempt. Both techniques were painful, whether hyperpronation is more or less painful compared to <span class=\"nowrap\">supination/flexion</span> was unclear in this analysis. The quality of the evidence was determined to be low due to lack of blinding in all studies and a high potential for selection bias (only three studies were randomized) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radial-head-subluxation-nursemaids-elbow/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>Reduction of RHS can usually be performed in the office or emergency department. Anesthesia and sedation are not required. Reduction may be attempted for the young child with typical physical findings, even when the classic history is lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radial-head-subluxation-nursemaids-elbow/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, the clinician should be wary of making the diagnosis of RHS in children older than five years and consider a broader differential diagnosis prior to attempting reduction. (See <a href=\"#H2053492342\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p>The reduction procedure is brief but painful. It is therefore important to explain the procedure to the caretakers before attempting reduction. The procedure is best performed with the child seated comfortably in the parent's arms and the examiner seated and facing the child.</p><p>Prior to reduction, the clinician should completely examine the affected arm and ensure no signs of fracture are present. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p>One of the following techniques can successfully reduce a RHS:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hyperpronation method</strong> &ndash; Based upon evidence of a higher first attempt success rate, the hyperpronation method is the suggested technique. The examiner supports the child's arm at the elbow and places moderate pressure with a finger on the radial head. The examiner grips the child's distal forearm with the other hand and hyperpronates the forearm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radial-head-subluxation-nursemaids-elbow/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A click may be felt by the finger over the radial head when the displacement is reduced (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52541\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52541 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">Supination/flexion</span> method</strong> &ndash; The <span class=\"nowrap\">supination/flexion</span> method is still widely taught but may result in a higher failure rate. The examiner supports the child's arm at the elbow and exerts moderate pressure on the radial head with one finger. With the other hand, the examiner holds the child's distal forearm, and then pulls with gentle traction. While maintaining traction, the examiner fully supinates the child's forearm and then fully flexes the elbow in one smooth motion. A click may be felt by the finger over the radial head or a pop may be heard by the examiner when the displacement is reduced (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81909\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81909 \">figure 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radial-head-subluxation-nursemaids-elbow/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p>Following successful reduction, there is immediate pain relief. Reduction is confirmed when the child moves the affected arm. This typically occurs within 5 to 10 minutes. Some children are initially reluctant to use the arm, but do so readily once they realize that it is no longer painful. Younger children may be coaxed to reach for a rattle, toy, or car keys as a way to indicate successful reduction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H99845398\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients who fail initial reduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 4 percent of patients with suspected RHS will fail reduction at the initial presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radial-head-subluxation-nursemaids-elbow/abstract/3,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,21</a>]. If the initial reduction is not successful (ie, the patient is not moving the arm after a period of observation of up to 20 minutes), then the clinician should reevaluate for subtle signs of fracture. If no signs of fracture are present, then reduction can be repeated up to two times. Although either method may be used for repeat reduction, the success rate with repeat reduction appears to be higher using the hyperpronation method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radial-head-subluxation-nursemaids-elbow/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>If the arm remains immobile, then plain radiographs of the elbow are warranted to evaluate for a fracture. Patients with fractures on imaging should receive appropriate immobilization and orthopedic consultation or referral as dictated by the degree of displacement and the specific type of fracture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-supracondylar-fractures-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of supracondylar fractures in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=proximal-fractures-of-the-forearm-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Proximal fractures of the forearm in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-condylar-elbow-fractures-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of condylar elbow fractures in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epicondylar-and-transphyseal-elbow-fractures-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epicondylar and transphyseal elbow fractures in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients who fail initial reduction and have normal plain radiographs of the elbow should have the arm placed in a sling. Additional symptomatic treatment includes <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ibuprofen</a> or other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medication, if no allergy or other contraindication to their use, and local application of ice packs, if tolerated, to reduce local swelling. Limited evidence suggests that these patients often will have normal arm movement at follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radial-head-subluxation-nursemaids-elbow/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. No long-term sequelae have been reported from unrecognized or unreduced RHS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radial-head-subluxation-nursemaids-elbow/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2281135969\"><span class=\"h3\">Recurrent radial head subluxation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RHS may recur when the child sustains another injury with the typical mechanism (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Terminology and pathophysiology'</a> above).

Recurrent RHS is reduced as described above. (See <a href=\"#H11574304\" class=\"local\">'Clinically suspected radial head subluxation'</a> above.)</p><p>After reduction of an easily reduced recurrent RHS, capable caregivers who are comfortable with learning the procedure can be taught the hyperpronation maneuver to permit home management of any future recurrences. However, the clinician should have confidence that the caregiver can reliably exclude signs of fracture before providing this instruction and have the parent demonstrate the technique before discharge.</p><p>Because of strengthening of the annular ligament, the injury rarely recurs after four to five years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radial-head-subluxation-nursemaids-elbow/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2521190292\"><span class=\"h2\">Disposition and follow-up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After successful reduction of a RHS, no additional treatment, immobilization, activity restriction, or follow-up is necessary. The caregiver should receive instructions on how to avoid recurrence (ie, avoid sudden pulling on the arms, picking the child up by the hands or wrists, and forcefully removing coats and shirts). (See <a href=\"#H531553265\" class=\"local\">'Information for patients'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients who fail reduction and are identified with a fracture on plain radiographs should receive appropriate immobilization and orthopedic consultation or referral as dictated by the degree of displacement and the specific type of fracture. Nondisplaced (type I) supracondylar fractures are the most frequently described fracture in patients initially misdiagnosed with RHS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radial-head-subluxation-nursemaids-elbow/abstract/13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15</a>]; the management of these injuries is provided separately.

With sudden pulling on the distal radius, a portion of the annular ligament slips over the head of the radius and slides into the radiohumeral joint, where it becomes trapped (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52710\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52710 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F86688\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86688 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Terminology and pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of RHS can be made when the characteristic history (ie, pulling on the arm) and examination findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82235\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82235 \">figure 3</a>) are present in a child younger than five years of age. The clinician should also ensure no focal bony tenderness, bruising, deformity, or swelling suggestive of a fracture prior to reduction. Radiologic investigation is usually not needed. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plain radiographs of the elbow may be appropriate in selected patients younger than five years of age to exclude fractures or dislocation when there is a concerning mechanism of injury (eg, direct blow or high force injury); a physical examination that demonstrates swelling, other than over the anterolateral aspect of the radial head; focal bony tenderness, bruising, or deformity; or inability to successfully reduce a presumed RHS. Nondisplaced (type I) supracondylar fractures are the most commonly reported fracture in children undergoing imaging during evaluation for RHS. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RHS is an uncommon cause of anterolateral elbow pain and limitation of motion in children older than five years of age. Unless there is a classic mechanism of an arm pull and a physical examination without tenderness, deformity, or swelling, such patients typically warrant plain radiographs of the elbow prior to attempts at reduction. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2053492342\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because of a higher first attempt success rate, we suggest that children with RHS undergo reduction by the hyperpronation method (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52541\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52541 \">figure 4</a>) rather than the <span class=\"nowrap\">supination/flexion</span> method (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81909\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81909 \">figure 5</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, the <span class=\"nowrap\">supination/flexion</span> technique is a reasonable alternative if the clinician has more experience with it. Following successful reduction, there is immediate pain relief. Reduction is confirmed when the child moves the affected arm. (See <a href=\"#H11574304\" class=\"local\">'Clinically suspected radial head subluxation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional management of children who fail initial reduction or who present with recurrent RHS is provided above. (See <a href=\"#H99845398\" class=\"local\">'Patients who fail initial reduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2281135969\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent radial head subluxation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After successful reduction of a RHS, no additional treatment, immobilization, activity restriction, or follow-up is necessary. The caregiver should receive instructions on how to avoid recurrence (ie, avoid sudden pulling on the arms, picking the child up by the hands or wrists, and forcefully removing coats and shirts). Disposition for patients who fail reduction depends upon the results of imaging. (See <a href=\"#H2521190292\" class=\"local\">'Disposition and follow-up'</a> above and <a href=\"#H531553265\" class=\"local\">'Information for patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most children with RHS do not need orthopedic consultation or referral. Patients with fractures discovered during the evaluation for RHS warrant orthopedic involvement as dictated by the degree of displacement and the specific type of fracture. Orthopedic referral is also appropriate for patients who fail initial attempts at reduction and have normal plain radiographs, especially if recovery of arm movement has not occurred by two to three days after injury. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Indications for specialty consultation or referral'</a> above.) </p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radial-head-subluxation-nursemaids-elbow/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Kaplan RE, Lillis KA.
