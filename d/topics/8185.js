There are several subtypes. The clinical manifestations, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of HAE with normal C1 inhibitor (HAE with normal C1INH, previously called type III HAE) will be reviewed here.</p><p>HAE types I and II, which are characterized by abnormalities in the level <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> function of the inhibitor of complement component 1 (C1 inhibitor or C1INH), are discussed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-angioedema-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-exacerbating-factors-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary angioedema: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, exacerbating factors, and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary angioedema: Pathogenesis and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-angioedema-general-care-and-long-term-prophylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary angioedema: General care and long-term prophylaxis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-angioedema-treatment-of-acute-attacks\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary angioedema: Treatment of acute attacks&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-angioedema-temporary-prophylaxis-before-procedures-or-stress-to-prevent-angioedema-episodes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary angioedema: Temporary prophylaxis before procedures or stress to prevent angioedema episodes&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6433176\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Information about the incidence and prevalence of HAE with normal C1INH is limited. It is a rare disorder, and there are no accepted test(s) for establishing the diagnosis. HAE with normal C1INH was initially assumed to be specific to women, but male members of affected families have since been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In the largest single series, approximately 11 percent of patients were male [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10208171\"><span class=\"h1\">BACKGROUND AND TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Historically, HAE was described as a familial disorder resulting from either deficiency or dysfunction of the inhibitor of C1INH. Types I and II are now collectively referred to as C1INH-HAE. However, in 2000, two different groups published descriptions of another familial form of angioedema, in which affected individuals had normal C1INH levels and activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thirty-six people from 10 families were detailed in the earliest study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. All of the affected individuals were women, and all of those tested had normal C1INH function and plasma concentration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a second report published in the same year, seven women from a single family were described in whom episodes only occurred during pregnancy or with the use of exogenous estrogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p>Subsequently, a number of additional families were described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/2,5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5-7</a>]. The largest series included 265 patients from 88 families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The terms &quot;estrogen-dependent&quot; and &quot;estrogen-associated inherited angioedema&quot; were used to describe this disorder prior to the identification of male patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This disorder has also been referred to as &quot;familial angioedema with normal C1INH&quot; and &quot;type III HAE.&quot; In an attempt to standardize nomenclature, a consensus statement from an international expert panel has recommended the disorder be designated &quot;HAE with normal C1INH&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>Two subtypes of HAE with normal C1INH are recognized:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HAE with normal C1INH and a factor XII mutation (FXII-HAE)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">and</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HAE with normal C1INH of unknown cause (U-HAE)</p><p/><p>In 2017, another possible mutation was identified that may represent a third subtype. (See <a href=\"#H6433183\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6433307\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HAE with normal C1INH has signs and symptoms similar to those of HAE associated with C1INH defects, with some distinguishing features.</p><p>Similarities between the three disorders include the occurrence of self-limited episodes of subcutaneous and submucosal angioedema lasting two to five days in the absence of treatment. All disorders affect the skin and the mucosa of the gastrointestinal and upper respiratory tract. Cutaneous attacks are the most common type, and episodes affecting the upper airway are less common but potentially life-threatening in all three disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/7,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11</a>]. Affected skin is nonpruritic and nonpitting, and urticaria is not seen. Some patients report a prodrome of numbness or tingling at the affected site. There is significant heterogeneity in all three disorders. Members of an affected family may be asymptomatic or symptomatic to varying degrees [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/7,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,12</a>].</p><p>The clinical manifestations of HAE are presented in more detail elsewhere. The remainder of the discussion here will focus on the differences between HAE with normal C1INH and the other forms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-angioedema-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-exacerbating-factors-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary angioedema: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, exacerbating factors, and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6791385\"><span class=\"h2\">Unique characteristics of HAE with normal C1INH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Differences have been noted between HAE with normal C1INH and C1INH-HAE:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Age of onset</strong> &ndash; HAE with normal C1INH usually presents in adulthood (after puberty). In a large series of 138 patients with the disorder, the mean age at disease onset was 26.8 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In contrast, more than one-half of patients with C1INH-HAE present during childhood with a mean age at disease onset of 11.7 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/7,9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9,11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>More prominent involvement of the tongue, uvula, and face</strong> &ndash; In HAE with normal C1INH, angioedema of the tongue, uvula, and facial skin occurs with higher frequency, and tongue swelling may be a diagnostic clue to its presence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/7,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,13</a>]. In the series of 138 patients mentioned previously, 54 percent experienced tongue swelling, compared with 12 percent in a series of patients with C1INH-HAE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Tongue swelling may herald laryngeal edema. Among 35 patients with laryngeal edema, 13 had experienced episodes associated with tongue swellings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Four of 138 patients in this series died due to asphyxiation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Less frequent abdominal attacks</strong> &ndash; Approximately 50 percent of patients with HAE with normal C1INH experience abdominal attacks, compared with at least 90 percent in patients with types I and II [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/7,11,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11,13,14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Females are affected more often and more severely</strong> &ndash; Within families affected by HAE with normal C1INH, females are more often symptomatic and have more severe symptoms than males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Less intense and more variable disease activity</strong> &ndash; Patients with HAE with normal C1INH usually have a decreased frequency of symptoms and a greater number of disease-free intervals. Many patients with the disorder experience prolonged periods (ie, one to several years) without symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In addition, attacks more often involve a single location in HAE with normal C1INH compared with C1INH-HAE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Different cutaneous findings</strong> &ndash; Hemorrhages into skin swellings and easy bruising have rarely been reported in patients with HAE with normal C1INH, although not in patients with types I and II [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The prodromal skin discoloration, erythema marginatum, which is reported by up to one-third of patients with C1INH-HAE, has <strong>not</strong> been observed in HAE with normal C1INH (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F79093\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79093 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lower penetrance</strong> &ndash; The inheritance pattern of HAE with normal C1INH shows generally low penetrance compared with C1INH-HAE, and obligate, asymptomatic carriers appear to be relatively common.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6433183\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mediator(s) responsible for swelling in HAE with normal C1INH has not been definitively identified. Excess generation of bradykinin, a potent vasoactive substance, has convincingly been shown to be the major facilitator of angioedema in C1INH-HAE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Activation of the kinin system is also thought to be critical in HAE with normal C1INH, but this has not been conclusively demonstrated.</p><p>The underlying molecular defect(s) for most patients with HAE with normal C1INH has not been determined, although the pattern of affected family members in successive generations supports an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/2,4,5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,5,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6433190\"><span class=\"h2\">Mutations in factor XII</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the importance of excess bradykinin formation in C1INH-HAE, it is reasonable to speculate that mutations of elements in the kinin-generating cascade may be responsible for HAE with normal C1INH as well. The kinin-generating pathways interface with the coagulation (contact system) and fibrinolytic pathways (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F87451\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87451 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Several mutations in the coagulation factor XII (FXII, Hageman factor) gene have clearly been identified in patients with HAE with normal C1INH:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two missense mutations involving the FXII gene were detected in 6 of 20 index patients from unrelated families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Both mutations were single heterozygous nucleotide substitutions within exon 9 of the FXII gene. The first and most common point mutation c.983C&gt;A (alternatively termed c.1032C&gt;A, Thr309Lys) results in substitution of a threonine residue for lysine (Thr328Lys), and the second c.983C&gt;G (alternatively termed c.1032C&gt;G, Thr309Arg) results in substitution of the same threonine residue for arginine (Thr328Arg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Neither mutation was detectable in 145 healthy controls. The same mutations have subsequently been identified in multiple other affected families and appear to segregate with the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/2,9,19-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9,19-26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A different FXII gene mutation resulting in deletion of a considerable number of base pairs (c.971_1018+24del72*) was identified in another family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. This large deletion is located in the same gene region as the previously identified missense mutations and was not detected in control subjects.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A duplication of 18 base pairs (c.892_909dup) in the FXII gene has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/2,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,27</a>]. The duplication occurs in the same region as the three mutations previously described and causes a repeated amino acid sequence (p.Pro283_Pro303) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p>The observation that several different mutations involving the same FXII gene region are present in affected patients and not in controls supports an association between FXII protein modifications and the disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In one study, mutations in the FXII gene were associated with normal plasma concentrations of FXII but an increase in its enzymatic activity when compared with healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, these findings could not be reproduced in a follow-up study using a more sensitive assay, and functional defects in FXII were not found [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Subsequently, a 2015 study proposed that mutations in FXII result in abnormal glycosylation and increased autoactivation of FXII. This increased FXII autoactivation could lead to excessive activation of the kallikrein-kinin pathway and bradykinin formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. These findings require confirmation and replication.</p><p>Not all members of a given family (not even all the females) who carry the FXII mutations are symptomatic, indicating that penetrance is incomplete, and other factors are necessary for disease development. Among 23 families affected by HAE with normal C1INH, 35 (33.7 percent) of 104 carriers of FXII mutations were asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Results from another study suggest variations in enzymes involved in kinin metabolism may modify disease expression and severity in HAE with normal C1INH associated with FXII mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The study included symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers of FXII mutations, as well as noncarrier relatives and healthy controls. The study showed a significant inverse relationship between disease severity and both angiotensin-I-converting enzyme activity and carboxypeptidase-N activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>FXII mutations do not appear to be equally prevalent in all populations. In the large German series of 265 patients, 69 (26 percent) demonstrated one of the four identified FXII mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In other series by the same group, one of these mutations was present in 17 to 25 percent of the families tested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/7,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,12</a>]. However, neither of these mutations was found in 40 patients analyzed in the United States, although the study in which this was reported was an analysis of samples submitted to a speciality commercial laboratory, and the clinical features of the patients were not available to the researchers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3648297173\"><span class=\"h2\">Other mutations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In one Italian family with HAE with normal C1INH of unknown cause (U-HAE), a mutation was identified in the gene encoding angiopoietin-1 (<em>ANGPT1</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The mutation, which is rare in the general population, was present in four symptomatic women and absent in seven unaffected relatives. Angiopoietin-1 has been shown to decrease bradykinin-induced plasma leakage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The family was part of a cohort of 47 patients with U-HAE: 25 patients from 10 unrelated families plus 22 additional individuals, although the angiopoietin-1 mutation was not found in the other families or the individual patients. The mutation did not alter plasma levels of angiopoietin-1 but impaired its ability to interact with its receptor (tunica interna endothelial cell kinase 2 [TIE2]) on endothelial cells. Thus, a potential additional cause of HAE has been identified in one family with multiple affected individuals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1099304880\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients without an identified mechanism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A subset of patients with HAE with normal C1INH does not have identifiable mutations in FXII or angiopoietin-1, and these individuals are said to have HAE of unknown etiology (U-HAE). There could be multiple mechanisms underlying U-HAE, and there could be subtle clinical and laboratory differences among different forms of HAE with normal C1INH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In a study of 265 patients with HAE with normal C1INH, those with a U-HAE-were less sensitive to estrogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6433197\"><span class=\"h2\">Other laboratory abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other laboratory abnormalities that have been identified in some patients with HAE with normal C1INH include genetic mutations in other proteins and deficiency of plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 (PAI-2). The presence of these abnormalities, as well as their role in pathogenesis, remains to be confirmed.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polymorphisms in the genes encoding aminopeptidase P and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), two enzymes that degrade bradykinin, were reported in three female subjects with HAE with normal C1INH. However, these patients also possessed the Thr328Lys mutation in the FXII gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deficiency of PAI-2, a molecule that inhibits the activation of plasminogen, was found to be deficient in 23 patients with HAE with normal C1INH, including patients both with and without a FXII mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. This abnormality was not present in 23 control patients with C1INH-HAE.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6433204\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of estrogens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effects of estrogens in HAE with normal C1INH is highly variable. The adverse effect of estrogens on female patients with this disorder was first highlighted in one of the original descriptions of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In this study, women only experienced angioedema attacks during pregnancy or while using some form of exogenous estrogen, including oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy. Additional patients with estrogen-exacerbated angioedema have since been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/6,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,37,38</a>]. However, other women with HAE with normal C1INH can tolerate high levels of estrogen without a worsening of angioedema attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/6,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,28</a>].</p><p>It is not entirely clear how estrogens would induce attacks, although they may influence expression of factors important in the synthesis and degradation of bradykinin. High levels of estrogens are reported to reduce plasma C1INH levels, increase transcription of FXII protein, and increase plasma prekallikrein levels, all favoring an increase in bradykinin production (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F87451\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87451 \">figure 1</a>). In keeping with some interaction between estrogens and FXII, patients with FXII-HAE were found to be more sensitive to estrogens than patients with U-HAE in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. ACE is important in degradation of bradykinin and its metabolite, and estrogens may reduce expression of ACE and allow bradykinin accumulation. Estrogens may also increase the expression of bradykinin type 2 receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>The negative influence of estrogens is not specific to HAE with normal C1INH, since estrogen is a well-established trigger in some females with C1INH-HAE.

Since angioedema is associated with multiple causes, a family history of angioedema or presence of factor XII (FXII) mutations known to be associated with the disease is also required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. HAE should be suspected in a patient with recurrent, self-limited angioedema without urticaria or pruritus, recurrent episodes of abdominal pain, laryngeal edema, and a family history of angioedema. Clinical features that help differentiate this disorder from C1INH-HAE were reviewed previously. (See <a href=\"#H6791385\" class=\"local\">'Unique characteristics of HAE with normal C1INH'</a> above.)</p><p>A diagnostic algorithm has been established for evaluating such patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F64553\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef64553 \">algorithm 1</a>). In contrast to those patients with either C1INH-HAE, patients with this type have normal plasma C1INH levels and activity, as well as normal plasma C4 levels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F83098\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83098 \">table 1</a>). Complement studies should be obtained during symptoms on at least one occasion to confirm that they are normal even during an episode of angioedema. Because there is no specific confirmatory test for HAE with normal C1INH, an international expert panel proposed a set of defined diagnostic criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. It is generally accepted that in the absence of a reliable biomarker, either the presence of an identified FXII mutation or a family history of angioedema is required for diagnosis, with the understanding that sporadic cases probably also exist. Thus, the following elements are necessary to make the diagnosis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Episodic angioedema affecting characteristic organs, without urticaria</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A family history of angioedema and failure to respond to chronic, high-dose antihistamine therapy <strong>or</strong> the presence of a FXII (or possibly an angiopoietin-1 mutation) associated with the disease (see <a href=\"#H6433190\" class=\"local\">'Mutations in factor XII'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal C4</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal C1INH level and function</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No medications that could cause angioedema, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10254556\"><span class=\"h2\">Exclude idiopathic angioedema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Idiopathic angioedema is a diagnosis of exclusion that describes recurrent episodes of angioedema without urticaria, for which no explanation can be found after a thorough evaluation to exclude drug reactions and allergic disorders (if indicated by the clinical history). Complement studies are normal in idiopathic angioedema. However, unlike HAE with normal C1INH, idiopathic angioedema often improves with antihistamines, alone or in combination with glucocorticoids. Therefore, a trial of antihistamine therapy is an important diagnostic step. The evidence supporting the use of H1 antihistamines in idiopathic angioedema is reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-angioedema-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management#H32\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of angioedema: Clinical features, diagnosis, and management&quot;, section on 'Recurrent, idiopathic angioedema'</a>.)</p><p>The following represents our approach, which has not been formally studied:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We treat patients with a nonsedating H1 antihistamine for at least one month (or an appropriate amount of time, depending upon the patient's frequency of attacks).

If this does not prevent episodes of angioedema, we double or quadruple the dose for another one to three months (cetirizine up to four times daily or an equivalent for one month or an interval long enough to expect three or more angioedema attacks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition, we instruct patients to treat with additional medications at the first sign of symptoms. Some patients have identifiable sensations in the skin or tissue just before the onset of angioedema, and the medications should be taken when these sensations appear. In this setting, we ask patients to self-administer 40 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> and 25 to 50 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a> all at once at the first sign of swelling, with no further doses.</p><p/><p>If one or both of these measures prevents further episodes of angioedema, then the most appropriate diagnosis is idiopathic angioedema.

However, FXII mutational testing is available through some commercial laboratories and establishes the diagnosis if positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6433225\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnoses of hereditary forms of angioedema are discussed in detail elsewhere.

This disorder must be excluded before the diagnosis of HAE with normal C1INH can be assigned, especially without a family history or if testing for FXII mutations is not performed or shows no mutations. A limitation to the proposed diagnostic criteria is the inability to completely distinguish HAE with normal C1INH of unknown cause (U-HAE) from nonhistaminergic idiopathic angioedema, highlighting the need for a valid confirmatory diagnostic test.

In addition, these agents take time to work, and the patient's airway must be protected in the interim. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-angioedema-treatment-of-acute-attacks\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary angioedema: Treatment of acute attacks&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Intubation should be performed immediately if stridor or signs of respiratory arrest are present.

The disorder was described in 2000 and was reported initially in females, although male patients have since been identified. (See <a href=\"#H6433169\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10208171\" class=\"local\">'Background and terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HAE with normal C1INH is clinically similar to C1INH-HAE, although there are minor differences. Patients with HAE with normal C1INH have more frequent facial and tongue swellings, less prominent abdominal symptoms, onset later in life (typically in adulthood), and different cutaneous findings.

Some families have mutations in the coagulation factor XII (FXII) gene, though the functional consequence of these mutations has not been established. Many female patients have more severe disease when pregnant or taking exogenous estrogens, while others are not influenced by hormonal factors. (See <a href=\"#H6433183\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the absence of a validated diagnostic test, HAE with normal C1INH is based on characteristic clinical features, a family history of angioedema or the presence of FXII or angiopoietin-1 mutations associated with the disease, and normal complement studies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F83098\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83098 \">table 1</a>). In patients who lack a family history of angioedema, it is important to exclude idiopathic angioedema, a disorder in which complements studies are also normal.
