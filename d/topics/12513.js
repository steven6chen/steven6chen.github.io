Specific polyneuropathies are discussed in more detail separately.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1056516454\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The terms &quot;polyneuropathy,&quot; &quot;peripheral neuropathy,&quot; and &quot;neuropathy&quot; are frequently used interchangeably, but are distinct.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polyneuropathy is a specific term that refers to a generalized, relatively homogeneous process affecting many peripheral nerves, with the distal nerves usually affected most prominently.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral neuropathy is a less precise term that is frequently used synonymously with polyneuropathy, but can also refer to any disorder of the peripheral nervous system including radiculopathies and mononeuropathies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuropathy, which again is frequently used synonymously with peripheral neuropathy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> polyneuropathy, can refer even more generally to disorders of the central and peripheral nervous system.</p><p/><p>The polyneuropathies must be distinguished from other diseases of the peripheral nervous system, including the mononeuropathies and mononeuropathy multiplex (multifocal neuropathy), and from some disorders of the central nervous system.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mononeuropathy refers to focal involvement of a single nerve, usually due to a local cause such as trauma, compression, or entrapment. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common example of a mononeuropathy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mononeuropathy multiplex refers to simultaneous or sequential involvement of noncontiguous nerve trunks. Used loosely, this term can refer to multiple compressive mononeuropathies. However, in its more specific meaning, it identifies multiple nerve infarcts due to a systemic vasculitic process that affects the vasa nervorum. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-vasculitic-neuropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of vasculitic neuropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diseases of the central nervous system such as a brain tumor, stroke, or spinal cord lesion occasionally present with symptoms that are difficult to distinguish from polyneuropathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-peripheral-nerve-and-muscle-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of peripheral nerve and muscle disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Polyneuropathy has a wide variety of causes, ranging from the common, such as diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-polyneuropathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], to the rare, such as some unusual forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. It often occurs as a side effect of medication or as a manifestation of systemic disease. The rate of progression of the polyneuropathy in conjunction with its character (axonal or demyelinating) can help identify its etiology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F54853%7ENEURO%2F69751%7EPC%2F58391\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54853 graphicRef69751 graphicRef58391 \">table 1A-C</a>).</p><p>The peripheral nerves are susceptible to a variety of toxic, inflammatory, hereditary, infectious, and parainfectious factors that can impair their health and function, leading to the clinical disorder of polyneuropathy. Unfortunately, there are no simple rules to apply that can reliably distinguish the type of polyneuropathy (eg, demyelinating versus axonal, chronic versus acute, sensory versus motor) produced by these disease categories.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6425345\"><span class=\"h2\">Diabetic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diabetic polyneuropathy is generally considered predominantly axonal; however, variable degrees of demyelination are often present, at least electrophysiologically. The mechanism underlying the development of diabetic neuropathy is extremely complex and likely relates to inflammatory, metabolic, and ischemic effects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-prevention-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and prevention of diabetic polyneuropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93179184\"><span class=\"h2\">Other systemic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other systemic diseases generally cause predominantly axonal polyneuropathies. Examples of these include the polyneuropathies associated with the following conditions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Longstanding human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hiv-associated-peripheral-neuropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of HIV-associated peripheral neuropathy&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Critical illness (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness#H3934991076\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuromuscular weakness related to critical illness&quot;, section on 'Critical illness polyneuropathy'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amyloidosis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-amyloidosis#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of amyloidosis&quot;, section on 'Neurologic abnormalities'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypothyroidism (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism&quot;, section on 'Neurologic dysfunction'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vitamin deficiencies (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-water-soluble-vitamins\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of water-soluble vitamins&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiency#H1060064805\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of vitamin B12 and folate deficiency&quot;, section on 'Neuropsychiatric changes'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lyme disease (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nervous-system-lyme-disease#H10939454\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nervous system Lyme disease&quot;, section on 'Peripheral nervous system'</a>)</p><p/><p>However, some important exceptions exist. As an example, polyneuropathy associated with monoclonal gammopathies is often demyelinating. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-mediated-neuropathies#H422772461\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune-mediated neuropathies&quot;, section on 'Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93179304\"><span class=\"h2\">Autoimmune</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most acute autoimmune neuropathies, namely Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome, are predominantly demyelinating, and a variety of clinical and experimental data have implicated both humoral factors and cell-mediated immune phenomena, which damage myelin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the myelin-producing Schwann cells. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome: Pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, axonal forms of this disease also exist. For example, one unusual but well-described variant of Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome is that of acute motor axonal polyneuropathy (AMAN). In this disorder, primary invasion of axons by inflammatory cells has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-polyneuropathy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Nonetheless, it is incorrect to simply classify all toxic neuropathies as axonal, since many exceptions exist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-polyneuropathy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. As an example, n-hexane exposure leads to neuropathy that has a substantial demyelinating component [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-polyneuropathy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6425359\"><span class=\"h2\">Hereditary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common forms of hereditary neuropathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58391\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58391 \">table 1C</a>), namely Charcot-Marie-Tooth types 1A, 1B, and X-linked, are all predominantly demyelinating in nature, although substantial coexistent axonal loss is usually also identified. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease: Genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other rare hereditary diseases that cause predominantly demyelinating polyneuropathies include those secondary to metabolic diseases of childhood, such as Krabbe disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy, adrenoleukodystrophy, and mitochondrial disorders.</p><p>Peripheral neuropathies associated with mitochondrial disorders most often exhibit an axonal pattern, as occurs with Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2A and the syndrome of neuropathy, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-polyneuropathy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Other mitochondrial disorders are associated with a demyelinating neuropathy, as occurs with mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE).</p><p>Porphyric neuropathy is primarily an axonal motor neuropathy that usually presents in the context of acute neurovisceral attacks, with variable manifestations of neuropathy, abdominal pain, confusion, and other neurologic and systemic symptoms. The acute hepatic porphyrias are inherited disorders caused by partial enzyme deficiencies affecting heme biosynthesis. Neurovisceral attacks are manifestations of four types of hepatic porphyria. The most common of these is acute intermittent porphyria; the others are hereditary coproporphyria, variegate porphyria, and delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase porphyria. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-intermittent-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute intermittent porphyria: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-coproporphyria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary coproporphyria&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=variegate-porphyria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Variegate porphyria&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ala-dehydratase-porphyria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ALA dehydratase porphyria&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6425387\"><span class=\"h2\">Environmental</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Environmental factors can also impact nerve health in substantial ways. Neuropathies associated with vibration-induced nerve damage, prolonged cold exposure, or hypoxemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-polyneuropathy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] have been well described. These disorders are mainly axonal in nature.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93179221\"><span class=\"h2\">Idiopathic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although population-based data are lacking, no specific cause is identified in up to one-quarter of patients with polyneuropathy at referral centers despite extensive investigations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-polyneuropathy/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. A variety of terms have been employed to describe this disorder, including chronic idiopathic axonal polyneuropathy (CIAP), chronic sensory polyneuropathy, chronic polyneuropathy of undetermined cause, unclassified peripheral neuropathy, and idiopathic neuropathy. Most such cases present in adults &ge;50 years of age and progress slowly over months to years. The symptoms are typically sensory, involving paresthesia, numbness or pain. Electrodiagnostic studies show a primarily axonal polyneuropathy. Proposed but unproven causes include impaired glucose tolerance, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and increased oxidative stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-polyneuropathy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Polyneuropathy is typically characterized by symmetric distal sensory loss, burning sensations, or weakness. Patients with very mild or asymptomatic polyneuropathy occasionally are identified on detailed sensory examination of the lower extremities. Alternatively, a patient may undergo electrodiagnostic testing for an unrelated problem, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, and mild abnormalities suggestive of polyneuropathy are identified. More advanced cases, however, typically present with symptoms suggestive of peripheral nerve disease, which may or may not be supported by findings on physical examination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F73819%7EPC%2F50878%7EPC%2F62629\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73819 graphicRef50878 graphicRef62629 \">table 2A-C</a>).</p><p>Causes of painful sensory polyneuropathy include the following (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F74991\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74991 \">table 3</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Idiopathic small fiber neuropathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetic peripheral neuropathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuropathy related to connective tissue disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vasculitic neuropathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuropathy associated with monoclonal gammopathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paraneoplastic sensory neuropathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Familial or acquired amyloid polyneuropathy</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presentation of patients with polyneuropathy varies significantly depending upon the underlying pathophysiology.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic axonal polyneuropathies (eg, due to diabetes mellitus or uremia) are by far the most common of the polyneuropathies. Injury tends to be related to axon length; thus, longer axons are affected first, resulting in symptoms that begin in the lower extremities. Sensory symptoms usually precede motor symptoms. Patients typically present with slowly progressive sensory loss and dysesthesias such as numbness, a burning sensation and pain in the feet, and mild gait abnormalities. As the syndrome progresses, mild weakness of the lower legs and hand symptoms may begin, resulting in the classic &quot;stocking and glove&quot; distribution of sensory loss. The numbness may continue to extend proximally in severe cases, affecting the intercostal nerves (the next longest nerve fibers after the arms), and causing sensory loss over the sternum. The top of the head may be affected with further progression.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In acute axonal polyneuropathies, such as that produced by toxic exposures or porphyria, patients may present with similar but much more fulminant symptoms. Pain is often a predominant component, although it can be distinctly absent. The polyneuropathy tends to worsen over two to three weeks, plateau, and then recover over months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with acute demyelinating polyneuropathies, primarily Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome (GBS), the presentation is often quite distinct from that of most axonal polyneuropathies. GBS tends to affect predominantly motor nerve fibers; thus, weakness rather than sensory loss typically is one of the earliest signs of the disease. Eventually, however, most patients will complain of some dysesthesias distally in the legs or arms. Gait difficulties or hand clumsiness secondary to reduced proprioception are also common complaints.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weakness and generalized sensory loss are often present simultaneously in patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-inflammatory-demyelinating-polyneuropathy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with hereditary polyneuropathies generally do not complain of positive symptoms such as paresthesias or pain. Often neither patients nor their families appreciate marked neurologic deficits or atrophy since the progression of the disease is slow and insidious [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-polyneuropathy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p>The history is important for distinguishing between polyneuropathy and mononeuropathy multiplex. Occasionally patients with the former will have symptoms that begin in one foot shortly before the other or are more pronounced in one foot. Mononeuropathy multiplex, in its acute form, usually presents with multiple mononeuropathies with involvement of entirely unrelated nerves, such as the median nerve in the arm and the sciatic nerve in the leg. However, patients may occasionally present with more symmetric sensory and motor symptoms affecting both legs that can be difficult to differentiate on clinical grounds from a severe subacute polyneuropathy. On detailed examination, relative preservation of one nerve (eg, posterior tibial) compared with another (eg, peroneal) may be identified.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abnormalities on physical examination are similarly dependent upon the type of polyneuropathy (axonal versus demyelinating) and which classes of nerve fibers are most involved (motor versus sensory).</p><p>In patients with an axonal polyneuropathy, motor examination may disclose wasting of the intrinsic muscles of the feet or lower leg; similar findings are evident in the hands in more severe cases. Distal loss of sensation to pin prick, light touch, vibration, cold, and proprioception may also occur. Reflexes become hypoactive or absent distally, usually at the ankles initially.</p><p>In contrast, generalized weakness is the rule in patients with symptoms of a more fulminant polyneuropathy secondary to demyelination. Distal muscles are predominantly affected, although weakness may affect proximal muscles to a greater extent in some individuals. Sensation is also reduced; large myelinated fibers are most damaged, resulting in abnormalities of vibratory testing and proprioception that are often out of proportion to loss of pin prick or temperature sensation. Reflexes are reduced diffusely and are often absent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical course</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with chronic axonal polyneuropathies generally experience a slow progression of disease over a period of years. As examples, in patients with diabetic polyneuropathy or older adults with an idiopathic axonal polyneuropathy, sensory loss will slowly ascend and increase in severity in the legs before the hands become affected (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of diabetic polyneuropathy&quot;</a>). In patients with axonal polyneuropathy secondary to toxins, such as alcoholic polyneuropathy, exacerbations will follow increasing exposure to the pathogen. When a one-time event has occurred, such as axonal polyneuropathy secondary to critical illness, gradual but incomplete recovery in distal sensation and strength is the rule, often over a period of many months or years. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuromuscular weakness related to critical illness&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The course of inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy is extremely variable. In patients with Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome, a two- to six-week period of decline is followed by stabilization and eventual improvement over several months; recovery generally depends upon the initial illness severity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome in adults: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guillain-barre-syndrome-in-children-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome in children: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, exacerbations may be followed by periods of stability in some, while in others there is a steady prolonged decline. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-inflammatory-demyelinating-polyneuropathy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-inflammatory-demyelinating-polyneuropathy-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with congenital demyelinating polyneuropathy, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, also have a variable course, even between family members with the disease. Some patients may first present in childhood, while others not until they are well into the seventh or eighth decade of life. After presentation, however, a very slow but inevitable progression of symptoms will occur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease: Genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diseases of the central nervous system can be difficult to distinguish from polyneuropathy. As an example, progressive numbness and weakness in the lower extremities may be due to a spinal cord process or polyneuropathy. Furthermore, acute myopathy, neuromuscular junction disease, or a central process may mimic Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome or chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-peripheral-nerve-and-muscle-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of peripheral nerve and muscle disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a number of issues to consider when evaluating patients who present with symptoms consistent with polyneuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-polyneuropathy/abstract/1,10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10-13</a>]. Extensive diagnostic testing is probably not necessary in a patient with mild symptoms who has a known underlying reason (eg, diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, or chemotherapy). On the other hand, a diagnostic evaluation is warranted in patients with no clear etiology or in whom symptoms are severe or rapidly progressive, and for patients with atypical features. (See <a href=\"#H3986570849\" class=\"local\">'Features warranting a full evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition to the history of the neuropathy itself, the patient should be asked about recent viral illnesses, other systemic symptoms, new medications, exposures to solvents, heavy metals, or other potential toxins, alcohol use, and a family history of neurologic disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3986570849\"><span class=\"h2\">Features warranting a full evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A full diagnostic evaluation should be pursued in patients with atypical features, including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-polyneuropathy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymmetry</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-length dependence</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Motor predominance</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute onset</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prominent autonomic involvement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe or rapidly progressive symptoms</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis of polyneuropathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A case definition of distal symmetric polyneuropathy developed by an expert panel may aid clinicians by providing diagnostic criteria with a relatively high sensitivity and specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-polyneuropathy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The panel assessed the diagnostic accuracy of neuropathic symptoms, neurologic signs (decreased or absent ankle reflexes, decreased distal sensation, distal muscle weakness or atrophy), and nerve conduction study (NCS) findings based on evidence from 12 high-quality studies. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy was the focus of most of these studies. The following observations were noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-polyneuropathy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms alone have a relatively poor diagnostic accuracy. Multiple neuropathic symptoms are more accurate than single symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs are better predictors of polyneuropathy than symptoms and should be weighted more heavily. A single abnormality on examination is less sensitive than multiple abnormalities. Therefore, an examination for polyneuropathy should look for a combination of signs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal electrodiagnostic studies provide a higher level of specificity to the case definition, but they should not be used alone to make the diagnosis. Abnormal NCS are the most informative part of the electrodiagnostic evaluation.</p><p/><p>A set of case definitions was rank ordered by estimated likelihood of distal symmetric polyneuropathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F53720\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53720 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-polyneuropathy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The highest likelihood of polyneuropathy occurred when a combination of multiple symptoms and signs were accompanied by abnormal electrodiagnostic studies.

In practice, this means that most blood tests should be deferred until the results of electromyography and nerve conduction studies testing are known.</p><p>One clear distinction that can be made by clinical neurophysiology is whether a neuropathy is due to axon loss or demyelination. As an example, thyroid function studies are unlikely to be useful if the neuropathy has prominent demyelinating features. Thus, instead of obtaining a laboratory &quot;screen&quot; for neuropathy, specific tests should be ordered based upon the pathophysiology of the underlying process (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F64055\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64055 \">table 5</a>). This approach is more cost-effective and less confusing than ordering multiple unneeded diagnostic tests.</p><p>In patients with distal symmetric polyneuropathy who are not initially evaluated with nerve conduction studies, the laboratory tests with the highest yield for detecting abnormalities are blood glucose, serum B12 level with methylmalonic acid (with or without homocysteine), and serum protein electrophoresis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F64055\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64055 \">table 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-polyneuropathy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This observation does not imply, however, that this screening approach is superior to choosing appropriate blood tests after clinical neurophysiologic evaluation has been performed.</p><p>Additional testing for select patients may include lumbar puncture, genetic testing, and muscle or nerve biopsy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H708848887\"><span class=\"h2\">EMG with axonal physiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An EMG study showing a predominantly axonal neuropathy suggests that the etiology is a systemic disorder, toxin, or drug. The initial laboratory evaluation should include blood glucose, glycohemoglobin, serum B12 level, serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and immunofixation, urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP) and immunofixation, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and serum antinuclear antibodies (ANA), the latter to evaluate for connective tissue disease. The personal and family history should be scrutinized for any evidence suggesting hereditary neuropathies that are axonal in nature, including Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2, mitochondrial disorders, and porphyria. If the initial testing is unrevealing, it is reasonable to test for urine heavy metals, urine porphyrins, and rheumatoid factor, to obtain methylmalonic acid and homocysteine levels for patients with borderline levels of serum B12, and to evaluate for Sj&ouml;gren disease, Lyme disease, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and hepatitis B and C. In the presence of sensory neuronopathy, anti-Hu (ANNA-1) antibody testing is warranted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1276140367\"><span class=\"h2\">EMG with demyelinating physiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An EMG study showing a predominantly demyelinating physiology suggests that the etiology is an autoimmune condition or a hereditary disorder.

In the presence of a compatible family history, examination, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hereditary features on EMG, genetic evaluation for Charcot-Marie-Tooth types 1A, 1B, and X-linked is warranted. Hereditary features include a fairly homogeneous slowing of conduction across all nerves without conduction block; acquired features generally have more heterogeneous slowing and conduction block, though the rule does not always hold (eg, in CMTX disease). If the evaluation points towards an acquired demyelinating polyneuropathy, then testing to detect monoclonal proteins is advised with serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and immunofixation, and urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP) and immunofixation. In addition, test for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV infection, GM1 and anti-MAG antibodies, and lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid analysis is advised. A lumbar puncture is helpful because most inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathies have a radicular component which produces a marked increase in spinal fluid protein with minimal elevation in cerebrospinal fluid white cells (albuminocytologic dissociation).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1211614579\"><span class=\"h2\">EMG with mixed axonal and demyelinating physiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With an EMG study showing a mixed axonal and demyelinating physiology, the workup is the same as with a demyelinating physiology (see <a href=\"#H1276140367\" class=\"local\">'EMG with demyelinating physiology'</a> above).

Identifying demyelination with associated inflammation in these individuals may help guide treatment (see <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below).</p><p>Pathologic study of nerve is sometimes helpful for picking up infiltrative diseases such as amyloid neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-polyneuropathy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], infectious diseases such as leprosy, and inflammatory neuropathies such as chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), mononeuropathy multiplex due to vasculitis, and sarcoidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-polyneuropathy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Clinically, all of these entities are characterized by some degree of asymmetry or focality. Nerve biopsy is also useful in patients with symptoms that suggest involvement primarily of small fibers (eg, painful polyneuropathies affecting pin and temperature sensation with relatively normal electrophysiology). As previously mentioned, <span class=\"nowrap\">EMG/NCS</span> cannot effectively evaluate these neurons.</p><p>Nerve biopsy is of low yield and should generally be avoided in patients with subacute or chronic distal symmetric polyneuropathies.

Special stains are then applied to the skin tissue and the number and morphology of axons within the epidermis evaluated, either by qualitative assessment, or by careful counting to determine intraepidermal nerve fiber density [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-polyneuropathy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

The composite autonomic scoring scale (CASS), which includes measurements of orthostatic blood pressure, the quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test, heart rate response to tilt, heart rate variability with deep breathing, and changes in blood pressure with the Valsalva maneuver, appears to provide a useful measure of autonomic function and can help support a diagnosis of small fiber sensory neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-polyneuropathy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

It often occurs as a side effect of medication or as a manifestation of systemic disease, but many cases are idiopathic. The rate of progression of the polyneuropathy in conjunction with its character (axonal or demyelinating) can help identify its etiology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F54853%7ENEURO%2F69751%7EPC%2F58391\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54853 graphicRef69751 graphicRef58391 \">table 1A-C</a>).The peripheral nerves are susceptible to a variety of toxic, inflammatory, hereditary, infectious, and parainfectious factors that can impair their health and function, leading to the clinical disorder of polyneuropathy.
