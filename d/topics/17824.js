A meta-analysis (five trials, 1404 nondialysis CKD patients) showed a greater Hb response with intravenous compared with oral iron, although the percentage of patients requiring an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) dose increase or blood transfusion was the same between groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-iron-deficiency-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease-ckd-patients/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Intravenous iron may be associated with an increased risk of adverse effects in nondialysis CKD patients, although data are conflicting. A randomized trial that included 136 patients was stopped early by an independent data and safety monitoring board in part because of a higher incidence of adverse effects in the intravenous iron group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-iron-deficiency-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease-ckd-patients/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Compared with the oral iron group, the intravenous iron group had more cardiovascular events (adjusted incidence rate ratio 2.51, 95% CI 1.56-4.04) and infection requiring hospitalization (adjusted incidence rate ratio 2.12, 95% CI 1.24-3.64). However, there is some debate as to the statistical analysis of this study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-iron-deficiency-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease-ckd-patients/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

In a meta-analysis of 16 trials and 2612 patients (including 10 trials of 2129 nondialysis CKD patients), there was no difference between oral and intravenous iron-treated patients in all-cause mortality and adverse effects.</p><p>We and others believe that the benefit outweighs the risk of intravenous iron in selected CKD patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-iron-deficiency-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease-ckd-patients/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p>The 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines have recommended that either oral iron therapy or intravenous iron therapy can be given in nondialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-iron-deficiency-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease-ckd-patients/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines suggest using oral iron for individuals who are not on ESAs and offering intravenous iron to those who do not tolerate oral therapy or do not reach targets within three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-iron-deficiency-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease-ckd-patients/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

The European Best Practice Guidelines suggest that intravenous iron is the optimal route of administration, but, for practical reasons, oral iron may be considered among CKD patients who are not on dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-iron-deficiency-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease-ckd-patients/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1652554978\"><span class=\"h2\">Goals of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of iron therapy is to correct absolute iron deficiency <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> to increase Hb level to that desired for the particular patient. We generally provide sufficient iron to accomplish this while attempting to maintain the TSAT &le;30 percent and the ferritin level &le;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span>. Although the dose varies among individual agents, a course of intravenous iron usually provides 1000 mg elemental iron. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous iron'</a> below.)</p><p>Some patients will not increase Hb to desired values despite achieving a TSAT of approximately 30 percent. Such patients may be candidates for treatment with ESAs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-anemia-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease#H3980240566\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of anemia in nondialysis chronic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents'</a>.)</p><p>There are no randomized, controlled trials that have compared different iron target levels among nondialysis patients. Support for the specific iron target levels are derived almost entirely from data among in-center hemodialysis patients. However, evidence from in-center hemodialysis patients may not directly apply to nondialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients, since dialysis-related blood loss does not occur. The studies that have examined these issues are discussed in detail separately.

For patients treated with oral iron, we usually switch to intravenous treatment if iron status tests and Hb are not improving and remain below goal.</p><p>Iron indices generally respond to intravenous iron therapy. Patients who do not achieve target TSAT and ferritin values, or at least show significant improvement in iron stores, despite intravenous iron should be evaluated for sources of blood loss, particularly gastrointestinal bleeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Individual agents</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2479031825\"><span class=\"h3\">Oral iron</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We usually give <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferrous-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferrous sulfate</a> 325 mg three times daily.

We monitor all CKD patients for anemia and iron deficiency. Screening tests for iron deficiency include the percent transferrin saturation (TSAT), which is the plasma iron divided by total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) x 100, and the serum ferritin concentration. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2430225913\" class=\"local\">'Continued monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indications for iron administration are based on the TSAT, ferritin, and, in some patients, the hemoglobin (Hb).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We give iron to most CKD patients who have a TSAT &le;20 percent and a serum ferritin concentration &le;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span>. Such patients are likely to have decreased iron stores (ie, have absolute iron deficiency).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We give iron to most <strong>anemic</strong> CKD patients who have a TSAT &le;30 percent and ferritin &le;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span>. Such patients may respond to supplemental iron administration with an increase in Hb level (or, among patients who are on an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent [ESA], with a reduction in ESA dose).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We do not treat with iron patients who have a TSAT &gt;30 percent, since such patients are unlikely to respond to iron. We do not routinely administer iron to patients with ferritin levels &gt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> and anemia, although each patient should be individually assessed. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Indications for treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among most nondialysis CKD patients who are selected for iron therapy, we give oral iron. We usually give <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferrous-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferrous sulfate</a> 325 mg (which provides 200 mg elemental iron) three times daily. Although multiple other agents are available, they tend to be more expensive, without greater efficacy or consistently fewer side effects. (See <a href=\"#H3175756367\" class=\"local\">'Route of administration'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2479031825\" class=\"local\">'Oral iron'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We give intravenous iron to selected patients who are defined above. Multiple intravenous iron agents are available. Although regimens vary among individual agents, a course of intravenous iron usually provides 1000 mg elemental iron. (See <a href=\"#H3175756367\" class=\"local\">'Route of administration'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous iron'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-iron-deficiency-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease-ckd-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Ma JZ, Ebben J, Xia H, Collins AJ.
