It is unclear when, or even whether, they will ever again be marketed in the United States. It may be possible to obtain iopanoic acid from compounding pharmacies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodinated-radiocontrast-agents-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]; the raw chemical is available from numerous suppliers worldwide.</p><p>Ipodate and iopanoic acid, two iodine-containing drugs marketed as oral cholecystographic agents, have been used in the treatment of hyperthyroidism. These drugs are the most potent inhibitors of 5'-monodeiodinase, thereby impairing the extrathyroidal conversion of thyroxine (T4) to the more potent triiodothyronine (T3). The release of iodine in pharmacologic quantities from these agents has the additional benefits of blocking thyroid hormone release and interfering with its synthesis in some patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iodine-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iodine in the treatment of hyperthyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>These agents are more potent than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propylthiouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propylthiouracil</a> in blocking the conversion of T4 to T3, and they result in a rapid reduction in serum T4 and T3 concentrations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F54848\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54848 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodinated-radiocontrast-agents-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Doses in most studies have ranged from 500 mg to 1000 mg as a single daily dose.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">LIMITATIONS TO USE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ipodate and iopanoic acid have been used as monotherapy for the treatment of hyperthyroidism caused by Graves' disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodinated-radiocontrast-agents-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, they are not as effective as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methimazole</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propylthiouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propylthiouracil</a> in controlling the hyperthyroidism, and the relapse rate after therapy is discontinued is higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodinated-radiocontrast-agents-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>There are also several additional problems with the use of these agents:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They may induce hyperthyroidism that is resistant to conventional doses of thionamides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodinated-radiocontrast-agents-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They should not be used as monotherapy in patients with toxic adenoma or toxic multinodular goiter, since the iodine may provide substrate for de novo hormone synthesis by the autonomous thyroid tissue, leading to more severe hyperthyroidism. They can be used in this setting only if thyroid hormone synthesis is first blocked by the administration of a thionamide. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-toxic-adenoma-and-toxic-multinodular-goiter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of toxic adenoma and toxic multinodular goiter&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MAJOR USES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major use of the iodinated radiocontrast agents has been in the treatment of severe hyperthyroidism or &quot;thyroid storm.&quot; The combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methimazole</a> and ipodate in such patients is more effective than methimazole alone or methimazole plus potassium iodide, and the serum T3 concentration may fall to normal within five days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodinated-radiocontrast-agents-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This rapid effect can also be used to quickly prepare patients for thyroid surgery.</p><p>Patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism who require rapid preparation for surgery or who are allergic to thionamides and who choose surgery also can benefit from an iodinated radiocontrast agent. These patients can be rendered euthyroid within five days with the triad of the radiocontrast agent, a beta blocker, and a glucocorticoid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodinated-radiocontrast-agents-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. As noted above, long-term use of these agents may result in resistant hyperthyroidism and should therefore be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodinated-radiocontrast-agents-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Iopanoic acid has also helped to lower T3 levels and hyperthyroid symptoms preoperatively in patients with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> associated hyperthyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodinated-radiocontrast-agents-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>These agents may also be effective during the hyperthyroid phase that can occur with subacute thyroiditis, a disorder in which thionamides are of no benefit since thyroid hormone is leaking from an inflamed gland. As an example, serum T3 levels fell rapidly after ipodate administration (500 mg daily or every other day) and patients noted symptomatic improvement within several days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodinated-radiocontrast-agents-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Ipodate was continued for 15 to 60 days until both T3 and T4 levels normalized.</p><p>Ipodate or iopanoic acid also may be useful in both adults and children with an acute <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levothyroxine</a> overdose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodinated-radiocontrast-agents-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].</p><p>Iopanoic acid, 500 mg daily for seven days, rapidly ameliorates Graves' hyperthyroidism. Sufficient recovery of the radioiodine uptake to allow radioiodine treatment occurs after one or two weeks after stopping iopanoic acid in 86 and 94 percent of patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodinated-radiocontrast-agents-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>As noted above, neither iopanoate nor ipodate are available in the United States.
