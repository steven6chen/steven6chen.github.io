The definition of PCOS has varied over the years. Based on the Rotterdam criteria, a diagnosis of PCOS requires two of three potential characteristics: oligo- <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anovulation, clinical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries (on pelvic ultrasound) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F86810\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86810 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-surgery-for-ovulation-induction-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Other causes of these signs or symptoms, such as late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia or Cushing's syndrome, must also be excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-surgery-for-ovulation-induction-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>For women with PCOS and infertility, ovulation induction with oral agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=letrozole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">letrozole</a> (off-label use for ovulation induction) is the first line of medical therapy. For women who are resistant to this treatment, ovulation may be induced with injections of follicle-stimulating hormone. Laparoscopic ovarian drilling (also referred to as laparoscopic ovarian diathermy or electrocoagulation) is a surgical option for second-line treatment. Ovarian drilling is not used commonly in the United States, but is a focus of the literature as a second-line treatment in Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-surgery-for-ovulation-induction-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p>Laparoscopic surgery with ovarian drilling in women with PCOS will be reviewed here.

For women who are resistant to this treatment, ovulation may be induced with injections of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) or laparoscopic ovarian drilling as second-line treatment. FSH injections are used more commonly in clinical practice because these do not require surgery and avoid adnexal adhesions that may result from ovarian drilling. Ovarian drilling, however, appears to be as effective as FSH and has several advantages compared with FSH.</p><p>Ovulation induction in women with PCOS is discussed briefly here to provide a context for the role of laparoscopic ovarian drilling. A comparison of the infertility treatment options for PCOS patients is shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56718\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56718 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Ovulation induction is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-ovulation-induction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of ovulation induction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovulation-induction-with-clomiphene-citrate\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovulation-induction-with-letrozole\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovulation induction with letrozole&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1120873960\"><span class=\"h2\">Ovulation induction in PCOS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PCOS is associated with infertility due to oligo- or anovulation. Weight loss in overweight or obese PCOS patients may result in resumption of ovulation. If this does not occur, or if the woman has a normal body mass index, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> has been the mainstay first-line medical therapy for ovulation induction since the 1960s. Clomiphene is effective, is an oral medication that is easy to administer, and has few adverse effects. In response to treatment with clomiphene, approximately 60 to 85 percent will ovulate, and approximately half of those will conceive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-surgery-for-ovulation-induction-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Another option for ovulation induction in PCOS is the aromatase inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=letrozole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">letrozole</a>, which resulted in higher ovulation and live birth rates than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> in a randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-surgery-for-ovulation-induction-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The dose is increased incrementally until a consistent ovulatory response is achieved. The duration of treatment may be increased from five to eight days <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> may be added for those who fail to ovulate on the maximal dose.</p><p>For women who remain anovulatory despite treatment with oral medications, the next step is typically injections of exogenous FSH, with or without luteinizing hormone (LH). FSH injections successfully induce ovulation in most infertile PCOS patients unresponsive to the oral medications. The disadvantage of FSH treatment is that it usually results in multifollicular ovulation with the associated risks of multiple gestation (including triplets or higher-order gestations) and in ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Frequent monitoring with pelvic ultrasonography and serum estradiol levels is required in an attempt to reduce these risks, with only partial success, and intense monitoring adds to the cost and inconvenience of the daily injections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-ovulation-induction#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of ovulation induction&quot;, section on 'Gonadotropin therapy'</a>.)</p><p>An alternative approach to ovulation induction in PCOS is laparoscopic ovarian drilling (also referred to as laparoscopic ovarian diathermy or electrocoagulation). Surgical approaches to restoring ovulation in women with PCOS date back to 1935, when bilateral ovarian wedge resection was introduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-surgery-for-ovulation-induction-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. It remained the sole treatment option for ovulation induction in PCOS until the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> citrate and exogenous gonadotropins became clinically available in the 1960s, when it rapidly fell out of favor. The problems with ovarian wedge resection were that it required a laparotomy; removed one-half to two-thirds of each ovary, predisposing the patients to diminished ovarian reserve; and often resulted in significant postoperative adnexal adhesions, which contributed to infertility even though normal ovulatory function was established.</p><p>Laparoscopic ovarian drilling was first reported in 1984 to induce ovulatory cycles without the disadvantages associated with ovarian wedge resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-surgery-for-ovulation-induction-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. It is an option as a second-line treatment for PCOS patients who remain anovulatory after treatment with oral agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=letrozole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">letrozole</a>, with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-surgery-for-ovulation-induction-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Although laparoscopic ovarian drilling is the accepted second-line treatment for ovulation induction in infertile clomiphene-resistant PCOS patients, there is merit for considering it as a first-line option instead of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=letrozole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">letrozole</a>. A randomized trial compared laparoscopic ovarian drilling with six cycles of clomiphene as first-line treatment and reported no differences in ovulation, pregnancy, miscarriage, and live birth rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-surgery-for-ovulation-induction-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Laparoscopic ovarian drilling could be performed in conjunction with diagnostic hysteroscopy in place of hysterosalpingography and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=letrozole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">letrozole</a>. Unlike clomiphene and letrozole, which carry a 3 to 8 percent risk for twins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-surgery-for-ovulation-induction-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], the beneficial effects of ovarian drilling on ovulation and conception continue beyond the six cycles of treatment. Laparoscopic ovarian drilling may even be justifiable for PCOS patients who are not attempting to conceive. These patients are typically treated with oral contraceptives for cycle regulation and to improve acne and hirsutism. As PCOS patients are often overweight and have hypertension and impaired glucose control, oral contraceptives may be a relative contraindication. These are clearly topics in need of study.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H349599374\"><span class=\"h2\">Ovarian drilling versus gonadotropins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laparoscopic ovarian drilling is as effective as FSH treatment, and results in a lower risk of higher-order multiple gestations and OHSS. In addition, after ovarian drilling, ovulatory cycles may persist for years. However, surgery is required and pelvic adhesions may develop postoperatively and this is a major disadvantage compared with FSH injections.</p><p>Several studies compared the second-line treatments of laparoscopic ovarian drilling and ovulation induction with FSH, with or without LH. A meta-analysis of randomized trials concluded that there were no differences in pregnancy, miscarriage, or live birth rates between the two groups. However, the multiple pregnancy rate was significantly less with ovarian drilling (1.2 percent versus 17.1 percent), as was the rate of OHSS <span class=\"nowrap\">(0/129</span> versus <span class=\"nowrap\">4/122</span> cases) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-surgery-for-ovulation-induction-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A subsequent meta-analysis confirmed these findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-surgery-for-ovulation-induction-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In addition, studies that assessed the cost-effectiveness of both treatments reported comparable cost or a significant reduction in cost to achieve a pregnancy with laparoscopic ovarian drilling over gonadotropin ovulation induction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-surgery-for-ovulation-induction-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>]. One retrospective study concluded that ovarian drilling was more costly, but the sample size was small (n = 78) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-surgery-for-ovulation-induction-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Importantly, not all of the studies included the additional cost of multiple pregnancies and OHSS. A long-term follow-up to one of the studies included in the meta-analysis reported that ovarian drilling significantly reduced the need for subsequent in vitro fertilization and increased the chance of having a second child, further adding to the cost-effectiveness of the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-surgery-for-ovulation-induction-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Finally, patients overwhelmingly preferred laparoscopic ovarian drilling over gonadotropin ovulation induction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-surgery-for-ovulation-induction-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].</p><p>A summary of the advantages and disadvantages of laparoscopic surgery and gonadotropin therapy for ovulation induction is shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F82084\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82084 \">table 3</a>). Despite the benefits of laparoscopic ovarian drilling, it is infrequently performed in the United States. This is likely due to lack of familiarity with the procedure as well as concerns for the complications, which are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H1151294\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1120874217\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism of laparoscopic ovulation induction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism(s) by which ovarian drilling results in resumption of follicular maturation and ovulation is still largely unknown. The most plausible mechanism involves the thermal destruction of the androgen-producing theca cells in the ovarian stroma. The reduction in intraovarian and peripheral androgens results in increased FSH and reduced LH secretion and an intrafollicular environment more conducive to normal follicular maturation and ovulation. Other theories include increased ovarian blood flow with delivery of more FSH, ovarian inflammation with production of growth factors, and increased insulin sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-surgery-for-ovulation-induction-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1150738\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laparoscopic ovarian drilling is a valid alternative for women with infertility associated with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) who failed to ovulate in response to oral ovulation induction agents. PCOS patients with unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss may also be candidates for ovarian drilling. Studies utilizing body mass index, serum gonadotropin and androgen levels, and the ultrasonic appearance of the ovaries to predict success with the procedure have yielded inconsistent results.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1036884694\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The indication for laparoscopic ovarian drilling, as noted above, is as a second-line therapy for ovulation induction in women with PCOS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1150745\"><span class=\"h3\">Prognostic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies assessed various preoperative factors in an effort to predict which patients will be more likely to become ovulatory and conceive following laparoscopic ovarian drilling. Luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), androgens, and anti-M&uuml;llerian hormone were higher and body mass index lower in responders compared with non-responders. However, some studies found that <span class=\"nowrap\">LH/FSH</span> ratio &lt;2, testosterone levels &gt;4.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L,</span> and free androgen index &gt;15 were associated with a poorer response. Ultrasonographic appearance of the ovaries was not predictive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-surgery-for-ovulation-induction-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/6,23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,23-25</a>]. In addition, PCOS patients with metabolic syndrome responded similarly to those without it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-surgery-for-ovulation-induction-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Regarding conception rates, younger women with a normal BMI and duration of infertility &lt;3 years had greater success.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H349599392\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contraindications to laparoscopic ovarian drilling include patients who are poor anesthetic risks for laparoscopy in general and those at a higher risk for intra- and postoperative complications such as extensive pelvic adhesions or coagulation disorders. In addition, patients requiring in vitro fertilization (IVF) for tubal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> male factors may be better served by proceeding directly to IVF. However, there is evidence that laparoscopic ovarian drilling may be advantageous prior to initiating IVF treatment by improving the response to gonadotropin superovulation and reducing cycle cancellation and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-surgery-for-ovulation-induction-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/6,27-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,27-31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H349599455\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION AND PREPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to surgery, patients undergo routine medical assessment prior to laparoscopic surgery, including pregnancy testing.</p><p>Indications for antibiotic prophylaxis and thromboprophylaxis are the same as for other gynecologic laparoscopy procedures.

Alternatively, 5 mm ancillary ports may be placed in each lower quadrant as needed to complete additional laparoscopic procedures. The procedure is simple to perform and requires no additional training beyond basic laparoscopic skills.</p><p>The preferred method for ovarian drilling utilizes a laparoscopic monopolar needle electrode (eg, Manhes high-frequency needle). It is very important to minimize thermal damage to the ovarian cortex, so current should not be activated until the insulated part of the needle is just below the ovarian cortex within the deeper ovarian stroma. It is also imperative to avoid the ovarian hilum by staying well above the mesovarium, as bleeding <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> compromised blood flow to the ovary may occur.</p><p>Although laparoscopic ovarian drilling has been around for three decades, the technique has never been standardized regarding the energy source, number of punctures, dose and duration per puncture, or whether one or both ovaries should be treated. Based on limited dose-ranging studies, four to six punctures per ovary at 40 W of coagulating (modulated) current for four seconds per puncture seems reasonable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-surgery-for-ovulation-induction-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The few studies that compared an adjusted dose to one or both ovaries (based on 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">J/cm</span> of ovarian volume) with a fixed dose per ovary reported better ovulation and pregnancy rates with adjusted dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-surgery-for-ovulation-induction-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. Furthermore, there was no advantage to treating both ovaries. A meta-analysis also reported comparable ovulation, pregnancy, miscarriage, and live birth rates between uni- and bilateral ovarian drilling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-surgery-for-ovulation-induction-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Assuming that the patient is having regular ovulatory cycles and there are no other infertility factors to address, patients may attempt to conceive without further intervention. If the patient remains anovulatory, the oral ovulation induction agents, which had previously failed, are reinitiated.

However, no difference was noted between laparoscopic ovarian drilling and gonadotropin treatment in the Cochrane analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-surgery-for-ovulation-induction-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>In addition, the non-reproductive benefits resulting from laparoscopic ovarian drilling must be considered. It is not surprising that several studies have shown that lowering androgen levels led to improvements in acne and hirsutism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-surgery-for-ovulation-induction-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/41,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,44,45</a>]. The clinical significance of restoring regular ovulatory cycles has not been acknowledged in the literature. Specifically, the risks of abnormal uterine bleeding and endometrial hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma from chronic unopposed estrogen are essentially eliminated. Unfortunately, a long-term study failed to demonstrate a reduction in the percentage of women who developed metabolic disease 8 to 12 years after laparoscopic ovarian drilling compared with those who were treated with gonadotropins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-surgery-for-ovulation-induction-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1151294\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two concerns have been raised regarding laparoscopic ovarian drilling, aside from the low risk of complications with laparoscopy in general. These concerns are pelvic adhesions and diminished ovarian reserve, similar to ovarian wedge resection. However, there is a lack of evidence to support a negative impact on ovarian reserve following ovarian drilling.</p><p>Second-look laparoscopy demonstrated periadnexal adhesions in approximately one-third of the patients treated by electrosurgery and 50 percent of those treated by laser [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-surgery-for-ovulation-induction-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. However, they were mild and did not correlate with pregnancy rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-surgery-for-ovulation-induction-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The number of punctures per ovary did not influence postoperative adhesion formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-surgery-for-ovulation-induction-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In addition, anti-adhesion modalities such as intraoperative application of adhesion barriers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-surgery-for-ovulation-induction-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/48,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,50</a>] and early second-look laparoscopy with lysis of adhesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-surgery-for-ovulation-induction-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>] did not affect pregnancy rates.</p><p>The reduction in AMH, antral follicle counts, and ovarian volume and increase in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) following ovarian drilling are evidence of the normalization of structure and function. However, some have claimed that they are indicative of diminished ovarian reserve. There is only one report of unilateral ovarian atrophy after laparoscopic ovarian drilling, but that case utilized eight punctures with 400 W for five seconds, over 10 times the usual energy levels applied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-surgery-for-ovulation-induction-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. No cases of early menopause have been reported in studies with long-term follow-up. Furthermore, a prospective study failed to find evidence of anti-ovarian antibodies that could potentially lead to ovarian failure due to autoimmune oophoritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-surgery-for-ovulation-induction-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. In a different study that compared women with PCOS or unexplained infertility with fertile controls, the women with PCOS had higher baseline levels of anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA), anti-histone, anti-nucleosome antibodies, and anti-nuclear antibodies than the other groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-surgery-for-ovulation-induction-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. These levels increased one month following ovarian drilling. However, anti-dsDNA, anti-histone, and anti-nucleosome antibodies were also significantly increased one month after diagnostic laparoscopy in the unexplained infertility group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-surgery-for-ovulation-induction-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Also, one-half of the PCOS patients with positive anti-nuclear antibodies were negative for all subtypes tested, calling into question the validity of the test.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1036885403\"><span class=\"h2\">Endocrine changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A significant reduction was noted in testosterone and LH levels within five days following laparoscopic ovarian drilling in nearly every study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-surgery-for-ovulation-induction-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The reduction in LH is due to a decrease in pulse amplitude, not frequency. Most studies also showed a reduction in androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and free androgen index with an increase in sex hormone-binding globulin. FSH remained unchanged or increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-surgery-for-ovulation-induction-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Studies with long-term follow-up documented that these changes persist for many years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-surgery-for-ovulation-induction-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>].

These factors may contribute to the greater risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome with FSH superovulation in PCOS patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-surgery-for-ovulation-induction-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>].

Diagnosis of PCOS requires two of three characteristics: oligo- <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anovulation, clinical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries (on pelvic ultrasound) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F86810\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86810 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with PCOS and infertility, ovulation induction with oral agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=letrozole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">letrozole</a>) is the first line of medical therapy. Second-line options are follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) injections or laparoscopic ovarian drilling. Laparoscopic ovarian drilling is as effective as FSH treatment and results in a lower risk of higher-order multiple gestations and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. However, surgery is required, and this is a major disadvantage compared with FSH injections. (See <a href=\"#H1120873310\" class=\"local\">'Overview of ovulation induction in PCOS'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most plausible mechanism by which ovarian drilling results in resumption of follicular maturation and ovulation is through the thermal destruction of the androgen-producing theca cells in the ovarian stroma. The reduction in intraovarian and peripheral androgens results in increased FSH and reduced luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion and an intrafollicular environment more conducive to normal follicular maturation and ovulation. (See <a href=\"#H1120874217\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of laparoscopic ovulation induction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Candidates for laparoscopic ovarian drilling include women with infertility associated with PCOS who failed to ovulate in response to oral ovulation induction agents. In some cases, it may be reasonable to use it as first-line therapy. In addition, PCOS patients with unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss may also benefit from ovarian drilling. Ovarian drilling may also be an option for PCOS patients who are not attempting to conceive, if compliance issues or medical contraindications limit medical options for managing chronic anovulation. (See <a href=\"#H1150738\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The preferred method for ovarian drilling utilizes a laparoscopic monopolar needle electrode (eg, Manhes high-frequency needle). It is very important to minimize thermal damage to the ovarian cortex and avoid the ovarian hilum. There are no high-quality data regarding the type of energy source, number of punctures, dose and duration per puncture, or whether one or both ovaries should be treated. Based on the available evidence, four to six punctures per ovary at 40 W of coagulating (modulated) current for four seconds per puncture seems reasonable. (See <a href=\"#H349599515\" class=\"local\">'Procedure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The reduction in LH, androgens, anti-M&uuml;llerian hormone, and inhibin enables the restoration of ovulatory cycles in approximately 80 percent of patients after ovarian drilling, with a range of 30 to 90 percent, in published studies. As with the endocrine changes, the normalization of ovulatory function continued for many years in the majority of patients following ovarian drilling. Pregnancy rates range from approximately 50 to 80 percent. (See <a href=\"#H1150879\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ovarian drilling decreases serum androgen concentrations and may improve acne and hirsutism. In addition, long-term restoration of ovulatory function may reduce the risk for endometrial hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma. (See <a href=\"#H1150879\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potential complications associated with laparoscopic ovarian drilling include perioperative complications of laparoscopy, pelvic adhesions, and diminished ovarian reserve. Second-look laparoscopy demonstrated periadnexal adhesions in approximately one-third of the patients treated by electrosurgery and 50 percent in those treated by laser; however, they were mild and did not correlate with pregnancy rates. There are few data to support a decrease in ovarian reserve.
