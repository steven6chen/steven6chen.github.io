People with this condition are born with it. But they might not find out that they have the condition until they are adults. People with aortic coarctation often also have a heart valve problem.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15992598\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of aortic coarctation?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with aortic coarctation do not have any symptoms. But some do have one or more of the following symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nosebleeds</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing, especially when exercising</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fatigue</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leg cramps</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain &ndash; People with aortic coarctation can develop a couple different types of chest pain:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Chest pain, pressure, or discomfort that happens when the heart muscle does not get enough blood to supply its needs. The medical term for this type of chest pain is &quot;angina.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A severe, sharp, &quot;tearing&quot; pain in the chest or back that is caused by a tear in the aorta. Medical terms for a tear in the aorta are &quot;aortic dissection&quot; or &quot;aortic rupture.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sudden facial droop or uneven face, weakness or numbness in an arm, or trouble speaking &ndash; These are symptoms of a stroke. A stroke is when a part of the brain is damaged because of a problem with blood flow. Strokes can happen if an artery in the brain closes off or starts to bleed.</p><p/><p>People with aortic coarctation usually have high blood pressure in their arms (especially the right arm) but low blood pressure in their legs. Also, their pulse is much weaker in the groin area than in the neck or arms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15992613\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there tests for aortic coarctation?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The doctor will do an exam and measure your pulse and blood pressure in your arms and legs. Other tests include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An electrocardiogram &ndash; This test measures the electrical activity of the heart. It is also called an &quot;ECG&quot; or &quot;EKG.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An echocardiogram &ndash; This test uses sound waves to take pictures of your heart and aorta.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An MRI or CT scan &ndash; These tests can take pictures of your aorta as well as the blood vessels in the head.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac catheterization (also called &quot;cardiac cath&quot;) &ndash; During this test, the doctor puts a thin tube into a blood vessel in your leg or arm. Then he or she moves the tube up to your heart. Next, the doctor puts a dye that shows up on X-ray into the tube. This part of the test is called &quot;angiography.&quot; It can show how much your aorta has narrowed. The doctor might also use dye to look at the blood supply to the heart.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15992628\"><span class=\"h1\">How is aortic coarctation treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High blood pressure is common in people with aortic coarctation. Medicines are used to treat high blood pressure.</p><p>Some people with aortic coarctation need a procedure to fix the aorta. The type of procedure depends how much your aorta has narrowed, your symptoms, and your age. Procedures include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Angioplasty &ndash; During angioplasty, a doctor puts a thin tube into a blood vessel in the leg or arm and advances the tube to the aorta. Then the doctor inflates a balloon inside the narrow part of the aorta to widen it. In some cases, the doctor props open the aorta using a mesh tube called a &quot;stent.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; Different types of surgery can fix the narrowed aorta. The surgeon might remove the narrowed part of the aorta. In some cases, he or she uses a plastic tube called a &quot;graft&quot; or a piece of another one of your blood vessels to fix the aorta.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15992643\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with aortic coarctation who want to get pregnant should talk to their doctor about the risks. Most women who have been treated can have a baby safely.</p><p>In some women who have not been treated for aortic coarctation, pregnancy can be dangerous and in rare cases, fatal. The most common problem is high blood pressure. If a woman's blood pressure stays in a normal range during her pregnancy, she can be treated for the condition after the baby is born. But if her blood pressure gets too high, she might need to take medicine to control it. In some cases, she might need a procedure to fix the aorta before giving birth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15992660\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people with aortic coarctation are able to live normal lives. But high blood pressure and aortic coarctation can return after treatment. So you will need to see your doctor regularly and get follow-up testing as recommended. Also, you should check with your doctor about what types of exercise you can do.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15992675\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High blood pressure in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=aortic-dissection-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Aortic dissection (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-heart-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Coronary heart disease (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
