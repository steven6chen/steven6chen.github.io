The patient is positioned supine with her arms extended on arm boards at &le;90 degrees abduction from the chest wall. Arm positioning with &gt;90 degrees of abduction from the chest wall increases the potential for stretching the brachial plexus and should be avoided. It is important to position the arm while the patient is awake to make sure the arm is not abducted beyond what is comfortable for the patient, especially if there are preexisting problems with shoulder mobility.</p><p>The ipsilateral arm can be included in the prepped field at the discretion of the surgeon, allowing the arm to be mobilized during the procedure. The lateral chest wall should be positioned along the edge of the operating table.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-conserving-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast conserving therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mastectomy-indications-types-and-concurrent-axillary-lymph-node-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mastectomy: Indications, types, and concurrent axillary lymph node management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The incision will vary depending upon the breast surgery being performed: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients undergoing an ALND alone or concurrently with partial mastectomy, a curvilinear incision is made approximately 1 to 2 cm below the edge of the axillary hair line following the natural skin folds (Langer's lines), extending from the anterior to the posterior axillary fold (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F52834\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52834 \">figure 8</a>). A better cosmetic result is obtained if the incision does not cross the anterior or posterior axillary folds. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients undergoing standard modified radical mastectomy without reconstruction, the ALND can be performed through the mastectomy incision once the breast has been removed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients undergoing a skin-sparing modified radical mastectomy with immediate reconstruction, the skin opening can be positioned over the axilla once the breast is removed to allow for the ALND. A small radial skin incision can be extended laterally to facilitate this approach. Alternatively, a separate incision in the axilla can be used when it is not feasible to reach the axilla through the breast skin opening.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H816102\"><span class=\"h2\">Critical steps of the dissection</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Definition of pectoralis muscles </strong>&#9472; The lateral edge of the pectoralis major muscle is retracted medially to expose the pectoralis minor muscle and allow interpectoral dissection of Rotter's lymph nodes. The medial pectoral neurovascular bundle, which innervates the pectoralis major and minor muscles, should be preserved during the dissection. The neurovascular bundle passes through the pectoralis minor muscle in 60 percent of patients and passes laterally around the pectoralis minor muscle in 40 percent. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Identification of latissimus dorsi &#9472;</strong> The anterior surface of the latissimus dorsi muscle is the lateral border of the axillary dissection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F64682\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64682 \">figure 9</a>). Dissection along the latissimus dorsi border is extended inferiorly until the muscle begins to pull toward the chest wall and superiorly to the tendon of insertion. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Clavipectoral fascia &#9472; </strong>The clavipectoral fascia is divided at the level of the inferior axillary sheath to expose the underlying fat pad and axillary lymph nodes within the fat. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Axillary vein </strong>&#9472; Dissection is carried posteriorly until the axillary vein is visualized, with care not to open the axillary sheath and strip or skeletonize the vein unless there is extensive nodal disease, because this increases the risk of injury to the vessels and lymphatics, which can increase the risk of lymphedema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-of-axillary-lymph-node-dissection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The axillary vein often bifurcates or trifurcates within the axillary space. Thus, transverse venous structures high in the axilla should <strong>never</strong> be ligated, even when they appear smaller than that expected for an axillary vein.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mobilization of the axillary fat pad &#9472;</strong> The fatty tissue and nodes are dissected off the chest wall and the inferior surface of the axillary vein. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Identification of intercostobrachial nerves &#9472; </strong>The sensory intercostobrachial nerves are encountered during the lateral dissection along the latissimus dorsi. It is difficult to spare branches that are located far inferior to the axillary vein, but this can be accomplished with careful dissection. By sharp dissection, the adventitial tissues can be incised along the nerve so that the nerve can be retracted anteriorly away from the underlying axillary fat pad and contents. If the intercostobrachial nerve branches cannot be spared, ligation should be performed sharply to avoid electrocautery conduction injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Identification of motor nerves &#9472;</strong> The positions of the long thoracic nerve and thoracodorsal neurovascular bundle can vary slightly from patient to patient. The best approach is to preserve all neural and vascular structures in unexpected positions, until the full axillary anatomy can be determined and before anything critical is sacrificed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The long thoracic nerve is identified by blunt dissection just below the medial aspect of the axillary vein and just lateral to the chest wall. One can often feel the nerve prior to visualizing it by palpating the tissues along the chest wall (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F53451\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53451 \">figure 10</a>). Once the nerve is identified, the plane is extended inferiorly for the length of the axillary field. It is important to try to keep the long thoracic nerve against the chest wall to reduce the likelihood of injury. The fascial layer on the serratus anterior that holds the long thoracic nerve in place should <strong>not</strong> be breached to avoid injury to the nerve.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The thoracodorsal neurovascular bundle can be identified by dissecting in the mid-axilla just inferior to the axillary vein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F78501\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78501 \">figure 7</a>). There is often a large superficial venous tributary arising from the axillary vein, called the thoracoepigastric vein, which is often just anterior to the position of the thoracodorsal neurovascular bundle. This superficial vein should not be transected until the neurovascular bundle is confirmed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Extent of dissection &#9472; </strong>The<strong> </strong>extent of dissection is defined by anatomic location (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57770\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57770 \">figure 11</a>). An accurate determination of the nodal level of a resected specimen can only be made if the specimen is marked by the surgeon or separated into levels before it is evaluated by the pathologist. (See <a href=\"#H8369105\" class=\"local\">'Surgical anatomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The extent of dissection is a tradeoff between the greater morbidity of a more extensive ALND and the possibility of leaving residual untreated axillary disease. In general, a level I and II anatomic ALND is the preferred procedure for axillary assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-of-axillary-lymph-node-dissection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The typical level <span class=\"nowrap\">I/II</span> dissection should yield &ge;10 axillary lymph nodes, although the range is highly variable. (See <a href=\"#H8370051\" class=\"local\">'Lymph nodes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Routine removal of level III nodes is unnecessary for staging but should be carried out to maximize local control if grossly positive axillary lymph nodes are identified intraoperatively. Level III lymph node dissection significantly increases the morbidity of the ALND. This level is not generally formally dissected; clinically suspicious level III nodes are separately resected and labeled as such for the pathologist. The reported incidence of skip metastases in the level III nodes with uninvolved level I nodes ranges from 0.2 to 3.1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-of-axillary-lymph-node-dissection/abstract/13-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-18</a>]. These numbers correlate well with locoregional recurrence rates following a level I and II ALND in women undergoing breast conserving surgery (3 percent or less) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-of-axillary-lymph-node-dissection/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>].

Blunt dissection is used to define the tissue planes between the axillary fat pad and contents and the underlying structures, progressing from superior to inferior in the operative field (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F63143\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63143 \">figure 12</a>). Palpation of level III nodes can then be performed by running the ventral surface of the index finger behind the pectoralis minor muscle and toward the infraclavicular space. If clinically suspicious nodes are palpated, they can be separately resected by retracting the pectoralis minor muscle for exposure.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H816085\"><span class=\"h2\">Drains</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before closure, some surgeons place a closed suction drain in the axillary space through a separate stab wound in the low axilla above the bra line. Other surgeons prefer not to place a drain; they aspirate any seroma that develops in the postoperative period, which is more<strong> </strong>comfortable for the patient and allows discharge after surgery without a hospital stay or cumbersome drain care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-of-axillary-lymph-node-dissection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Meta-analyses of available randomized trials have demonstrated that axillary drains decrease seroma formation and the volume and frequency of postoperative seroma aspiration; however, they extend hospital stay and do not affect the incidence of wound infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-of-axillary-lymph-node-dissection/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4692244\"><span class=\"h2\">Axillary reverse mapping</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Axillary reverse mapping (ARM) is an experimental technique, being investigated as a method of preserving the upper extremity lymphatics during ALND in an attempt to reduce the risk of postoperative lymphedema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-of-axillary-lymph-node-dissection/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>].

In two studies of 23 patients each, metastases were present in the nodes related to ARM sampling in 14 and 60 percent of patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-of-axillary-lymph-node-dissection/abstract/27,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,29,30</a>].

Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) remains the standard initial approach for breast cancer patients who have locally advanced (T4a, b, c) or inflammatory breast cancer (T4d), and needle-biopsy-proven metastatic disease in axillary lymph node(s). Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the standard initial approach for all other patients with early stage breast cancer who are clinically node negative.

Axillary lymph nodes are divided into three levels based upon their relationship to the pectoralis minor muscle. (See <a href=\"#H8370051\" class=\"local\">'Lymph nodes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An ALND is usually performed through a small incision and confirmation of the anatomic landmarks is crucial for avoiding injuries with functional consequences.
