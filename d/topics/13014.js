A study analyzing SEER data from 1973 to 2006 found that 95 percent of cases diagnosed during this interval arose in the white population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-merkel-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>MCC is typically seen in older individuals, with a mean age at diagnosis of 76 years for women and 74 years for men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-merkel-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, MCC occurs at a younger age and higher incidence in immunosuppressed subjects, including organ transplant recipients, HIV-infected individuals, and those with B-cell malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-merkel-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma/abstract/8-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-14</a>].</p><p>Data from the United States Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients and 15 population-based cancer registries indicate that transplant recipients have a 24-fold higher risk of MCC than immunocompetent patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-merkel-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

In a SEER database study of over two million patients with cancer, the risk of MCC was significantly increased in those with multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and malignant melanoma (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] 3.7, 6.9, and 3.1, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-merkel-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. During the first year after diagnosis, patients with a primary diagnosis of MCC had a significantly increased incidence of second cancers of the salivary gland, biliary tract, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR 11.6, 7.2, and 2.6, respectively).</p><p>A retrospective study of 4164 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and 172 patients with MCC supported the association between these two disorders reported in the SEER database study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-merkel-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Among patients with a diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the incidence of a subsequent diagnosis of MCC was greatly elevated (SIR 15.7, 95% CI 3.2-46.0).

However, this hypothesis is controversial. An alternative hypothesis is that these tumors originate from an immature totipotential stem cell that acquires neuroendocrine features during malignant transformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-merkel-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25397096\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several factors have been associated with the development of MCC. These include infection with the Merkel cell polyomavirus, ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure, and immunosuppression.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Merkel cell polyomavirus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) is a non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus that has been causally linked to the development of MCC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F61586\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61586 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-merkel-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. Previous studies have consistently reported that MCPyV can be detected in approximately 80 percent and 60 percent of all MCCs by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-merkel-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. A 2015 meta-analysis of 23 studies found an overall MCPyV prevalence of 79 percent (95% CI 72-84 percent) in Merkel cell tumors versus 12 percent (95% CI 8-9 percent) in control skin samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-merkel-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In one study using monoclonal antibodies capable of detecting large T antigen by immunohistochemistry, 56 of 58 (97 percent) MCCs were found to be associated with MCPyV, whereas enhanced quantitative PCR primers detected viral DNA in all 60 MCC tumors tested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-merkel-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>MCPyV is an ubiquitous virus, with five specific geographically related genotypic variants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-merkel-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. MCPyV is thought to be part of the human skin microbiome and appears to be chronically shed from the skin in the form of assembled virions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-merkel-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].&nbsp;The seroprevalence of antibodies specific to the capsid viral protein 1 (VP1) appears to increase with age, from approximately 40 percent in children up to over 80 percent in older individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-merkel-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma/abstract/22,28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,28-30</a>].</p><p>The observation that the integration of the virus into the tumor genome precedes the clonal expansion of tumor cells suggests that the virus is present at tumor initiation and that one or more viral proteins are oncogenic drivers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-merkel-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma/abstract/19,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,31</a>]. MCPyV encodes two main oncoproteins, the large tumor antigen (LT) and small tumor antigen (sT), which are both persistently expressed in MCC and have been implicated in oncogenesis through multiple mechanisms. Sequential events involved in the pathogenesis of MCPyV-positive tumors include clonal integration into the host genome, expression of sT, acquisition of mutations in the 3' end of LT, and evasion of a destructive immune response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-merkel-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma/abstract/1,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,32,33</a>].</p><p>Mutations in LT result in a truncated molecule that lacks the DNA binding domain and the helicase domain, which renders the virus replication incompetent while preserving its retinoblastoma gene (<em>RB1</em>) binding property and the expression of the oncogenic viral proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-merkel-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. LT antigens with intact <em>RB1</em> binding domain sequester and inactivate the tumor suppressor, resulting in sustained tumor growth.</p><p>Merkel cell polyomavirus has been detected in normal-appearing skin and in other tumors, including cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and folliculotropic mycosis fungoides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-merkel-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma/abstract/35-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-41</a>]. In one series of patients with MCC, skin samples taken from sites distant from the tumor were positive for the virus in 10 out of 14 cases (71 percent), a frequency higher than was observed in six skin samples from normal individuals (17 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-merkel-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Importantly, outside of MCC, evidence of clonal integration of the virus and expression of viral proteins in tumor cells is almost invariably lacking in other cancers, suggesting that the occasional detection of the virus was likely coincidental rather than causal in non-MCC tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-merkel-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59398060\"><span class=\"h2\">UV radiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure, especially to the sun, is thought to play an important role in the etiology of many cases of MCC.

This hypothesis is supported by the observation that in Australia the incidence of MCC is highest, but the prevalence of MCPyV-positive tumors is much lower than in other geographic areas. An Australian study of 95 MCC reported a 23 percent prevalence of MCPyV positivity; the prevalence was even lower in tumors occurring in skin areas with evidence of sun damage (ie, elastosis, squamous dysplasia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-merkel-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunosuppression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of MCC is increased in immunosuppressed patients, including organ transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-merkel-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma/abstract/8-10,50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10,50-52</a>], HIV-infected individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-merkel-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>], and those with B-cell malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-merkel-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma/abstract/8,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,13,14</a>].

Immunosuppression may facilitate the replication of MCPyV and increase the chance of virus integration in the MCC progenitor cell. In addition, reduced immune surveillance may contribute to the survival and proliferation of atypical cells. Finally, immunosuppressive agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> or calcineurin inhibitors have been shown to act synergistically with UV radiation in inducing mutagenesis and promoting skin carcinogenesis in an immunosuppression-independent manner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-merkel-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma/abstract/53-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H65922917\"><span class=\"h2\">Viral-negative MCC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some MCCs have low or negligible levels of MCPyV T antigen expression. The mechanisms of oncogenesis underlying MCPyV-negative MCC are incompletely understood, but they are thought to involve somatic mutations in tumor suppressor genes such as <em>TP53</em> and retinoblastoma (<em>RB1</em>), as well as epigenetic alterations, such as DNA methylation and microRNAs, resulting in aberrant expression and activity of oncogenes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-merkel-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma/abstract/34,58-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,58-61</a>]. Mutations in <em>TP53 </em>(encoding p53) occur infrequently in MCCs and have been found almost exclusively in tumors with low or complete lack of MCPyV LT antigen expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-merkel-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>]. The expression of retinoblastoma protein (RB), a key cell cycle regulator, is low or absent in viral-negative tumors, whereas nearly all MCPyV-positive&nbsp;tumors are also RB-positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-merkel-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p>The frequency of <em>TP53</em>&nbsp;mutations, either UV signature mutations or non-UV signature mutations, appears to be higher in&nbsp;MCPyV-negative&nbsp;MCCs than in&nbsp;MCPyV-positive&nbsp;tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-merkel-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. An analysis of MCPyV-positive and MCPyV-negative MCCs using next-generation sequencing found an overall high mutational burden in MCPyV-negative tumors, compared with MCPyV-positive tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-merkel-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. In MCPyV-negative tumors, the majority of tandem substitutions were CC &gt; TT substitutions, characteristic of UV mutational signature, whereas only one CC &gt; TT tandem substitution was detected across all MCPyV-positive tumors. Activating oncogenic mutations in <em>HRAS</em>, <em>PIK3CA</em>, <em>KNSTRN</em>, <em>PREX2</em>, and <em>RAC1</em> were found in six of eight MCPyV-negative tumors but only in two of eight MCPyV-positive tumors. Highly recurrent mutations in tumor suppressor genes, including <em>TP53</em>, <em>RBI</em>, <em>NOTCH1</em>, and <em>PRUNE2</em> were also found in MCPyV-negative tumors.
