Affected patients have life-long cyanosis but are generally asymptomatic unless they have type II congenital methemoglobinemia. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Congenital methemoglobinemia'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acquired methemoglobinemia</strong> typically results from ingestion of specific drugs or agents that cause an increase in the production of methemoglobin.

The ferric hemes of methemoglobin are <strong>unable</strong> to reversibly bind oxygen. In addition, the oxygen affinity of any remaining globins' ferrous hemes in the hemoglobin tetramer are increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. As a result, the oxygen dissociation curve is &quot;left-shifted&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81216\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81216 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-disorders-of-hemoglobin-oxygen-affinity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic disorders of hemoglobin oxygen affinity&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The net effect is that patients with acutely increased concentrations of methemoglobin have a functional anemia (ie, the amount of functional hemoglobin is less than the measured level of total hemoglobin). The circulating methemoglobin-containing hemoglobin molecules are unable to deliver oxygen and the remaining oxyhemoglobin has increased oxygen affinity, resulting in impaired oxygen delivery to the tissues. Those with chronically increased methemoglobinemia and functional anemia may develop compensatory <span class=\"nowrap\">polycythemia/erythrocytosis</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

This auto-oxidation is paralleled with continuous reduction of methemoglobin by the mechanisms described below, acting to maintain a steady-state level of methemoglobin of less than 1 percent of total hemoglobin in normal individuals.</p><p>There are two pathways for reduction of methemoglobin back to hemoglobin:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The only physiologically important pathway is the NADH-dependent reaction catalyzed by cytochrome b5 reductase (b5R). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics and pathogenesis of methemoglobinemia&quot;, section on 'Methemoglobin'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An alternative pathway that is not physiologically active utilizes NADPH generated by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) in the hexose monophosphate shunt. However, there is normally no electron carrier present in red blood cells to interact with NADPH methemoglobin reductase. Extrinsically administered electron acceptors, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a> (MB) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b2-riboflavin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">riboflavin</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F53599\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53599 \">figure 2</a>), are required for this pathway to be activated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This non-physiologic pathway becomes clinically important for the treatment of methemoglobinemia.

This disorder is typically seen in three settings: endemic methemoglobinemia; in individuals from consanguineous unions; or in certain isolated populations (eg, the &quot;founder effect&quot; described in Yakuts people, Athabascans, Navajo people, and Puerto Ricans) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. All endemic methemoglobinemias are type I cytochrome b5 reductase deficiency or due to compound heterozygosity for cytochrome b5 reductase deficiency, which is primarily seen in sporadic cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics and pathogenesis of methemoglobinemia&quot;, section on 'Cytochrome b5 reductase deficiency'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hemoglobin M disease</strong> &ndash; Another congenital cause of methemoglobinemia is autosomal dominant hemoglobin M disease due to mutations in either the alpha or beta or, rarely, gamma globin gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In most of the mutations, tyrosine is substituted for either the proximal or distal histidine in the heme pocket and forms an Fe3+-phenolate complex that resists reduction of Fe3+ heme iron to the divalent state. The net effect is life-long methemoglobinemia. Administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a> (MB) does not correct this type of congenital methemoglobinemia. There is no effective treatment for the methemoglobinemia seen in this condition, nor should any treatment be required.

These may include medication overdoses or poisoning but may also occur with medications given at standard doses, particularly in individuals with partial deficiencies of cytochrome b5 reductase. Infants and premature infants are particularly susceptible to the development of methemoglobinemia because their erythrocyte cytochrome b5 reductase activity is normally 50 to 60 percent of adult activity.

The preferred method is analysis for methemoglobin directly, rather than assessment of oxygen saturation or blood gas analysis. This is done by analyzing a freshly obtained blood sample (venous or arterial) for its absorption spectrum; methemoglobin has peak absorbance at 631 nm. A fresh blood specimen should always be obtained as methemoglobin levels increase with storage.</p><p>The standard method of assaying methemoglobin uses a microprocessor-controlled, fixed wavelength co-oximeter. This instrument interprets all readings in the 630 nm range as methemoglobin; thus, false positives may occur in the presence of other pigments, including sulfhemoglobin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a> (MB), and certain drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>].</p><p>Optimally, methemoglobin detected by the co-oximeter is confirmed by the specific Evelyn-Malloy method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. This assay involves the addition of cyanide, which binds to the positively charged methemoglobin, eliminating the peak at 630 to 635 nm in direct proportion to the methemoglobin concentration. The subsequent addition of ferricyanide converts the entire specimen to cyanomethemoglobin for measurement of the total hemoglobin concentration. Methemoglobin is then expressed as a percentage of the total concentration of hemoglobin. Use of the Evelyn-Malloy method for determining the concentration of methemoglobin is especially desirable after the therapeutic use of MB, since the co-oximeter &quot;reads&quot; MB as if it were methemoglobin. However, the ability to perform this relatively simple reaction is increasingly not available in most clinical laboratories. In those instances, the methemoglobin quantitation by the Rad-57 pulse oximeter is the preferred method of detection.

This is because standard pulse oximeter measurements of methemoglobin are unreliable in the presence of MB. (See <a href=\"#H1807751\" class=\"local\">'Inaccuracy of routine pulse oximetry and blood gas analysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is reasonable to perform serial measurements of methemoglobin levels following treatment with MB in order to evaluate the patient for subsequent worsening and the need for additional treatment. However, too frequent administration of MB should be avoided. As an example, the administration of repeated doses of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> doses has produced acute hemolysis even in patients with normal G6PD levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88122597\"><span class=\"h3\">Toxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Caution should be exercised to avoid overdosage because large (&gt;7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> cumulative doses of MB can cause dyspnea and chest pain as well as hemolysis in some susceptible subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>]. Since co-oximetry detects MB as methemoglobin, this technique cannot be used to follow the response of methemoglobin levels to treatment with MB. If needed, the specific Evelyn-Malloy method will discriminate between methemoglobin and MB.

As a result, MB may not only be ineffective, but it is also potentially dangerous since MB has an oxidant potential that may induce hemolysis in G6PD-deficient subjects, precipitating acute hemolysis, thus further decreasing oxygen delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/6,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,72</a>].

In order to avoid these problems, pretreatment screening of populations with a high incidence of G6PD deficiency (eg, African Americans, individuals of Mediterranean descent, and Southeast Asians) is reasonable, although usually not practical.</p><p>If MB is contraindicated due to known G6PD deficiency, only moderate doses of ascorbic acid (300 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> orally in divided doses) should be given (see <a href=\"#H14746542\" class=\"local\">'Ascorbic acid'</a> below), as this drug may also cause oxidant hemolysis in G6PD-deficient patients when given in very high doses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F74254\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74254 \">table 3</a>).
