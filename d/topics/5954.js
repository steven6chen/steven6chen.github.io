It is calculated by taking the difference between the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and the intracranial pressure (ICP), as expressed in the formula CPP = MAP &ndash; ICP. The pathophysiology of elevated ICP is discussed in detail separately; issues of particular relevance to airway management are highlighted below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of elevated intracranial pressure in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=elevated-intracranial-pressure-icp-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Autoregulation is the ability to regulate cerebral blood flow (CBF) over a wide range of MAPs. CPP is typically preserved through a MAP range of approximately 60 to 160 mmHg. When severe intracranial hypertension develops, autoregulation often is impaired. In this setting, excessive systemic hypotension can aggravate brain injury by causing cerebral hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, with resultant cerebral edema and increasing ICP. Hypotension is especially harmful and must be avoided whenever possible. Mild permissive systemic hypertension might be necessary in the setting of increased ICP to maintain cerebral perfusion. Excessive hypertension, especially in the setting of impaired autoregulation, can further increase ICP.</p><p>Patients with intracranial hypertension present a particular clinical challenge, since many airway management techniques potentially increase ICP. Often, these patients are the victims of multiple trauma and present with hypovolemia with or without hypotension, thus limiting the choice of agents and techniques available.</p><p>In such cases, it might appear that increases in MAP would be beneficial by allowing CPP and oxygenation of brain tissue to be maintained. However, because of the loss of autoregulation in patients with intracranial injury, increases in MAP can translate directly into increases in ICP. Thus, not only is the driving gradient for CPP increased, but the absolute ICP is increased as well. Accordingly, it is important to try to maintain the MAP in a reasonable range (approximately 100 to 110 mmHg) to optimize cerebral perfusion and to minimize absolute ICP.</p><p>The techniques and medications used in airway management may increase ICP through several mechanisms. These include the reflex sympathetic response to laryngoscopy (RSRL), other reflexive responses to stimulation and manipulation of the upper airway (eg, laryngoscopy and placement of the endotracheal tube), and the direct increase in ICP stimulated by certain medications used during intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-the-patient-with-elevated-icp/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The RSRL is stimulated by the sensory innervation of the supraglottic larynx, which results in increased serum levels of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norepinephrine-noradrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norepinephrine</a>, and vasopressin&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-the-patient-with-elevated-icp/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. The innervation of the upper and lower airways is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuronal-control-of-the-airways\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuronal control of the airways&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Use of the laryngoscope or attempted placement of an endotracheal tube results in a significant afferent discharge that increases cardiovascular sympathetic activity. For direct laryngoscopy attempts up to 45 seconds in duration, the longer the attempt the greater the sympathetic nervous system stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-the-patient-with-elevated-icp/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Both the lighted stylet and fiberoptic techniques result in reflex sympathetic responses that are comparable to direct laryngoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-the-patient-with-elevated-icp/abstract/4,7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7-9</a>].</p><p>The catecholamine surge caused by RSRL leads to an increased heart rate and blood pressure, which significantly enhances cerebral blood flow (CBF) through redistribution and increased cerebral blood volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-the-patient-with-elevated-icp/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Ultimately, these hemodynamic changes can exacerbate intracranial hypertension if autoregulation is impaired, and therefore, it is desirable to mitigate such responses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RAPID SEQUENCE INTUBATION (RSI) FOR ELEVATED ICP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We believe rapid sequence intubation (RSI) is the preferred method for securing the airway in patients with suspected elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). This recommendation is based upon its high success rate and low incidence of complications. However, no outcome studies have been performed to determine the best approach to airway management in these patients.</p><p>RSI protocols are designed to minimize potentially adverse reactions, such as the reflex sympathetic response that occurs during airway manipulation. Assessment of the airway and the performance of RSI are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the difficult airway in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation for adults outside the operating room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-rsi-outside-the-operating-room-in-children-approach\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) outside the operating room in children: Approach&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When performing RSI in the patient with elevated ICP, gentle, controlled technique is desired and prolonged or multiple attempts at intubation should be avoided whenever possible. Minimizing stimulation of the supraglottic larynx reduces the reflexive responses that can exacerbate elevations in ICP. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p>The use of RSI in patients with the potential for neurologic deficits carries the responsibility of performing and documenting an appropriate neurologic evaluation, when possible, prior to the initiation of neuromuscular blockade. The assessment should include the patient's ability to interact with surroundings, pupillary reflexes, and motor response to voice and pain. The careful recording of these findings establishes a baseline for comparison during subsequent monitoring, as well as providing important prognostic information.</p><p>Maintaining oxygenation is vital in patients with elevated ICP. Preoxygenation plays an important role in RSI by allowing the clinician to maintain high oxyhemoglobin saturation without requiring bag-mask ventilation while neuromuscular blockade takes effect, thereby minimizing the risk of aspiration. However, if the patient's oxygenation is compromised, positive pressure ventilation with a bag and mask may be required throughout the preintubation sequence. In such circumstances, the increased risk of aspiration is offset by the hazard of inadequate oxygenation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation for adults outside the operating room&quot;, section on 'Preoxygenation'</a>.)</p><p>Do not forego appropriate induction and neuromuscular blocking agents in the comatose patient who is to undergo RSI. The pathologic reflexes described above do occur in comatose patients, though they may appear unresponsive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-the-patient-with-elevated-icp/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PRETREATMENT AGENTS FOR RSI</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview and approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intracranial pressure (ICP) can increase as a result of the reflex sympathetic response to laryngoscopy (RSRL) and direct reflexive responses to airway manipulation. The mechanisms by which these responses occur are outlined above. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p>To blunt the rise in ICP caused by these adverse responses during RSI, we suggest pretreatment with a short-acting opioid (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a>) in patients whose conditions would be exacerbated by a rise in ICP. Such conditions may include acute brain injury, ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, meningitis or encephalitis, cerebral edema, and hypertensive encephalopathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F69683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69683 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of elevated intracranial pressure in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We give <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> IV over 30 to 60 seconds. Fentanyl should <strong>NOT</strong> be given to hypotensive patients or patients with hypovolemia who are dependent upon sympathetic drive to maintain a minimally compensated blood pressure.</p><p>No outcome studies have demonstrated that transient increases in ICP result in worse patient outcomes, and the use of pretreatment medications should be viewed as supplementary (ie, nonessential) in RSI. Nevertheless, short-acting opioids are relatively safe and may be beneficial when given in the proper setting. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Ultra-short acting opioid'</a> below.)</p><p>The findings of studies of the effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> on elevated ICP are inconsistent and we no longer suggest pretreatment with lidocaine. While short-acting beta blockers (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esmolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">esmolol</a>) minimize reflex hypertension and tachycardia due to laryngoscopy, they are not used in the acute trauma setting because of the risk of hypotension. The use of a defasciculating dose of a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent to reduce the ICP response that occurs during the fasciculations caused by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a> is of unproven benefit and is not recommended.

In small, randomized and nonrandomized clinical trials, intravenous lidocaine has shown mixed and inconsistent attenuation of the blood pressure and pulse response to ETI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-the-patient-with-elevated-icp/abstract/11,16,23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,16,23-25</a>]. Studies of the drug's effect upon ICP also report inconsistent results.

Thus, we believe ketamine is an appropriate induction agent for normotensive or hypotensive patients with elevated ICP. However, the use of ketamine in head-injured patients remains controversial among some clinicians; this issue is discussed separately.

When time permits, a drying agent (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycopyrrolate-glycopyrronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glycopyrrolate</a> 0.2 to 0.4 mg IV) improves the efficacy of topical anesthetics and should be used. Topical anaesthesia, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> 4%, can be combined with a vasoconstrictor, such as topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenylephrine</a> 0.5%, and administered via nebulizer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-the-patient-with-elevated-icp/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The choices of sedative agent and opioid analgesic are the same as for the patient with normal intracranial pressure and are guided by assessment of the patient's hemodynamic and respiratory status.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIATING MECHANICAL VENTILATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mechanical ventilation in the patient with elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) should be predicated upon three principles:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Optimize oxygenation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevent hypocapnia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid ventilation mechanics that increase cerebral venous congestion (eg, positive end-expiratory pressure, high peak inspiratory pressure)</p><p/><p>Reduction in PaCO<sub>2</sub> tensions in the brain leads to vasoconstriction, decreased cerebral blood flow, and decreased ICP. Therefore, patients should be ventilated in such a way as to target the lower limits of normocapnia (PaCO<sub>2</sub> of 35 mmHg). Hypocapnia (PaCO<sub>2</sub> &lt;35) is linked to worse patient outcomes in both prehospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-the-patient-with-elevated-icp/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>] and in-hospital studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-the-patient-with-elevated-icp/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Consequently, carbon dioxide tension should be followed with continuous capnography and correlated with arterial blood gas analysis. Hyperventilation to a PaCO<sub>2</sub> of 30 mmHg should only be used when osmotic agents and CSF drainage are not effective in managing an acute rise in ICP that is accompanied by neurologic deterioration. </p><p>Long-term analgesia and sedation should be used as needed to permit effective mechanical ventilation, minimize sympathetic response, and reduce elevated ICP. If these measures are ineffective, pharmacological paralysis may be needed. Further discussion of mechanical ventilation and monitoring in the setting of elevated ICP is found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-the-emergency-department#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanical ventilation of adults in the emergency department&quot;, section on 'Elevated intracranial pressure'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-the-emergency-department#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanical ventilation of adults in the emergency department&quot;, section on 'General invasive positive pressure ventilation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of elevated intracranial pressure in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The techniques and medications used in airway management may increase intracranial pressure (ICP) through several mechanisms. Such elevations can cause harm in patients whose ICP is already high due to acute brain injury, ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, meningitis or encephalitis, cerebral edema, and hypertensive encephalopathy. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) is the primary method for securing the airway in patients with suspected elevated ICP whose airways are not anticipated to be difficult. Assessment of the airway and the performance of RSI are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the difficult airway in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation for adults outside the operating room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-rsi-outside-the-operating-room-in-children-approach\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) outside the operating room in children: Approach&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of pretreatment medications is supplementary (ie, nonessential) in RSI. When time allows, we suggest pretreatment with a short-acting opioid (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a>) to blunt the rise in ICP during RSI in patients whose condition would be exacerbated by any further increase (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We give fentanyl 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> IV over 30 to 60 seconds. Fentanyl should <strong>NOT</strong> be given to hypotensive patients or patients with hypovolemia who are dependent upon sympathetic drive to maintain blood pressure. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Overview and approach'</a> above and <a href=\"#H75316048\" class=\"local\">'Lidocaine'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Ultra-short acting opioid'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etomidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etomidate</a> (0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV push) be used as the induction agent for RSI in patients with elevated ICP (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ketamine</a> (1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV) may be used in hypotensive or normotensive patients. For patients with elevated ICP who are at no risk of hypotension, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methohexital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methohexital</a> may be used.

We prefer succinylcholine because of its rapid onset, consistent and reliable effects, and short duration of action. Nondepolarizing (ie, competitive) NMBAs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rocuronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rocuronium</a> do not cause an elevation of ICP and can also be used for RSI in this setting.
