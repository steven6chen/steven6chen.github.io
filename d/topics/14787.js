Open or laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication may be chosen for those patients who do not wish to remain on an antisecretory medication, have an inadequate response to antisecretory medication, have a large hiatal hernia, or have persistence of esophagitis on medication. Esophagitis and GERD symptoms are improved or resolved after fundoplication in 76 to 98 percent of patients, while esophageal acid exposure time is normalized in approximately 90 percent of patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of gastroesophageal reflux in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Minimally invasive alternatives to standard antireflux surgery have been developed, including the application of controlled radiofrequency (RF) energy to the lower esophageal sphincter region (Stretta procedure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-treatment-for-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. An advantage of RF treatment is that it can be used in patients with challenging anatomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-treatment-for-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The Stretta system was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2000. </p><p>This topic review will provide an overview of radiofrequency treatment for GERD. Medical and surgical treatments for GERD are discussed separately.

Although the precise mechanisms of benefit in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are unclear, RF treatment appears to reduce postprandial transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations and decrease compliance of the gastroesophageal junction, may decrease esophageal acid sensitivity by inducing healing of esophageal erosive disease, and may improve gastroparesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-treatment-for-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-reflux-esophagitis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of reflux esophagitis&quot;, section on 'Transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations'</a>.)</p><p>One theory is that RF treatment improves symptoms of GERD through radiofrequency ablation of sensory neurons of the distal esophagus, leading to hyposensitization without an effect on pH. In a study of 13 patients undergoing pH monitoring and Bernstein acid perfusion testing, esophageal acid sensitivity was decreased six months after RF treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-treatment-for-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, this hypothesis was not supported in a report of 118 patients examining the relationship between symptom improvement (GERD-health-related quality of life [HRQL] and heartburn scores, general satisfaction, daily proton pump inhibitor [PPI] use) and intraesophageal acid exposure (percent proximal and distal esophageal time with pH &lt;4.0) six months after RF treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-treatment-for-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Responders to RF treatment had significant improvements in both proximal and distal acid exposure times. By contrast, non-responders had either no improvement or less improvement in proximal and distal acid exposure times. Changes in GERD-HRQL and heartburn severity positively correlated with changes in acid exposure. </p><p>In a sham-controlled study, RF treatment improved GERD symptoms and decreased gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) compliance three months after the initial procedure. In this trial, the administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sildenafil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sildenafil</a>, an esophageal smooth muscle relaxant, normalized GEJ compliance again to pre-procedure levels, arguing against GEJ fibrosis as the underlying mechanism. Decreased GEJ compliance, which reflects altered lower esophageal sphincter neuromuscular function, may contribute to the symptomatic benefit of RF treatment by decreasing refluxate volume. The study was limited because it did not include impedance monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-treatment-for-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Delayed gastric emptying (gastroparesis) may be associated with severe reflux. In a single practice cohort study, RF treatment was shown to correct gastroparesis and improve symptoms. Of 31 patients treated, 23 patients (74 percent) normalized gastric emptying, while all patients had significant improvements in GERD-HRQL at one-year symptom assessment. The mechanism of action remains unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-treatment-for-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2748502\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT SELECTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2085798865\"><span class=\"h2\">Good candidates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ideal candidates for radiofrequency (RF) treatment are those who:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suffer from frequent heartburn, regurgitation, or both.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have adequate esophageal peristalsis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a 24-hour pH study demonstrating pathologic acid reflux (total acid exposure time greater than 4 percent, or a DeMeester composite score &gt;14.7).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have nonerosive reflux disease, have grade I or II esophagitis by Savary-Miller criteria, or have higher grades of esophagitis healed by drug therapy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults#H82189930\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux in adults&quot;, section on 'Endoscopic findings'</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have unsatisfactory control of GERD with properly escalated proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy.</p><p/><p>In addition, patients may be offered RF therapy if they do not wish to be on long-term medical treatment for GERD.

The four-channel radiofrequency generator and catheter system delivers pure sine-wave energy (465 kHz, 2 to 5 watts per channel, 80 volts maximum at 100 to 800 ohms). Each needle tip incorporates a thermocouple that automatically modulates power output to maintain a desired target (muscle) tissue temperature. Maintaining lesion temperatures below 100&deg;C minimizes the collateral tissue damage due to vaporization and high impedance values. Temperature is similarly monitored with a thermocouple at each needle base, and power delivery ceases if the mucosal temperature exceeds 47&deg;C.</p><p>Patients are prepared in a manner similar to that for standard esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). Intravenous access is obtained, and heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation are monitored. Patients typically require high doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> (5 to 7 mg) and either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> (100 to 150 mcg) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meperidine-pethidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meperidine</a> (100 to 125 mg) during treatment. There is mild discomfort due to catheter passage in 25 percent of cases; mild-to-moderate discomfort is also experienced with RF delivery in 50 to 70 percent of cases. In those cases, additional medication is generally provided. Alternatively, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> may be used. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of procedural sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A standard EGD is then performed, and the distance from the incisors to the squamocolumnar junction (z-line) is measured. The endoscope is removed, and the RF catheter is passed transorally and positioned 2 cm above the z-line according to the distance measured during EGD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52786\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52786 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F81200\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81200 \">figure 2</a>). The four needle electrodes are deployed to a preset length of 5.5 mm, and RF delivery is commenced. Each electrode delivers RF energy for 90 seconds to achieve a target temperature of 85&deg;C. Additional lesion sets are created by rotating and changing the linear position of the catheter to create several rings of lesions 2 cm above and below cardia. The catheter is then removed and the EGD repeated. Currently, patients receive 56 lesions placed over a period of 35 minutes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F69012\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69012 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F82292\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82292 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFICACY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3007317358\"><span class=\"h2\">Overall results</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple studies have examined the efficacy of radiofrequency (RF) treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

The rate of PPI use was lower in patients who underwent radiofrequency treatment compared with rate of preprocedure PPI use (49 versus 97 percent). Radiofrequency treatment reduced esophageal acid exposure, but did not significantly improve lower esophageal sphincter (LES) basal pressure. </p><p>The efficacy of RF treatment was also examined in a meta-analysis of 18 randomized trials, cohort studies, and reviews with 1441 patients performed over a 10-year span [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-treatment-for-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. RF treatment improved heartburn scores (decrease in mean heartburn score in the pooled analysis from 3.55 to 1.19) and quality of life. Esophageal acid exposure was lower following the procedure compared with baseline (DeMeester score of 28.5 versus 44.4) but did not normalize.

Following RF treatment, 6 of 10 patients reported having no or very mild symptoms.
