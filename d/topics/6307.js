Although most often a primary bone tumor, ES was also reported to arise in soft tissue (extraosseous Ewing sarcoma [EES]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p>However, over the last several decades, it has become clear that these entities comprise the same spectrum of neoplastic diseases known as the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (EFT), which also includes malignant small cell tumor of the chest wall (Askin tumor) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] and atypical ES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Because of their similar histologic and immunohistochemical characteristics and their shared nonrandom chromosomal translocations, these tumors are considered to be derived from a common cell of origin, although the histogenic origin of this cell is debated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/6-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-13</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Histogenesis'</a> below.)</p><p>The EFT can develop in almost any bone or soft tissue, but the most common site is in a flat or long bone, and patients typically present with localized pain and swelling. Although overt metastatic disease is found in fewer than 25 percent at the time of diagnosis, subclinical metastatic disease is assumed to be present in nearly all patients because of the 80 to 90 percent relapse rate in patients undergoing local therapy alone. As a result, systemic chemotherapy has evolved as an important component of treatment.</p><p>Advances in multidisciplinary management of EFT over the past 30 years have resulted in a marked improvement in survival and a greater likelihood of limb-sparing surgery rather than amputation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-sarcomas-preoperative-evaluation-histologic-classification-and-principles-of-surgical-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bone sarcomas: Preoperative evaluation, histologic classification, and principles of surgical management&quot;</a>).</p><p>In data derived from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), five-year survival rates for patients with ES rose between 1975 and 2000 in all age groups, although the improvements were most marked in younger individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Five-year survival rates in those treated between 1993 and 2000 were &gt;65 percent, whereas for those over the age of 15, they were below 50 percent. Among young patients presenting with nonmetastatic disease who receive modern multidisciplinary treatment, long-term survival can be achieved in 70 to 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>Here we will discuss the epidemiology, pathology, and molecular genetics of <span class=\"nowrap\">EFT/peripheral</span> PNET.

Although rare, the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (EFT) represent the second most common primary bone malignancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F81481\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81481 \">table 1</a>) affecting children and adolescents, after osteosarcoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/14,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,18</a>]. Despite this, EFT is responsible for only 3.5 percent of cancers in American children 10 to 14 years old and for 2.3 percent of those arising among 15 to 19 year olds. A similar incidence (2.8 percent of all tumors in children aged 15 to 19 years old) is described in adolescents in England [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>In the United States, 650 to 700 children and adolescents younger than 20 years old are diagnosed with bone tumors every year, of which only 200 are EFT and the remainder osteosarcomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The peak incidence is between 10 to 15 years of age. However, 30 percent of cases arise in children under the age of 10, and another 30 percent are in adults over the age of 20 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. As with many pediatric tumors, there is a slight male predominance.</p><p>Racial and ethnic factors are of epidemiologic importance. For unclear reasons, the EFT affect mainly Caucasians and are extremely uncommon among blacks (both in the United States and Africa) and Asians (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F81715\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81715 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>]. The reason for this striking ethnic distribution is not known. However, interethnic differences exist for certain alleles of the Ewing sarcoma gene (the <em>EWSR1</em> gene, MIM#133450), which is consistently disrupted in these tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]&nbsp;(see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'EWSR1 translocations in EFT'</a> below). Furthermore, genome-wide association studies have raised the possibility that genetic susceptibility factors may contribute to the observed <span class=\"nowrap\">geographical/ethnic</span> differences in Ewing sarcoma incidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EFT have not been consistently associated with specific familial or congenital syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>], although at least one series reports an excess of congenital mesenchymal defects in affected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], and another suggests an increase in neuroectodermal tumors and stomach cancer in the families of patients with Ewing sarcoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Furthermore, a minority of cases may be associated with an inherited cancer predisposition. In a study that used next-generation sequencing to determine the contribution of germline predisposition mutations in 1120 children with cancer, mutations that were deemed to be pathogenic or probably pathogenic were identified in 5 out of 46 (11 percent) patients with Ewing sarcoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Three of the germline mutations were in <em>TP53,</em> the gene associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, two were in the <em>RET </em>gene, which is associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2), and one was in the <em>PMS2</em> gene, which is involved in DNA mismatch repair. Importantly, family history did not predict the presence of an underlying predisposition syndrome in most patients. Despite these data, a <span class=\"nowrap\">causative/pathogenic</span> role for these inherited germline mutations in the development of Ewing sarcoma has not been demonstrated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=li-fraumeni-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Li-Fraumeni syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-genetics-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and genetics of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Specific environmental exposures have <strong>not</strong> been identified as risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/29,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,33</a>]. EFT develop rarely after treatment of a primary cancer during childhood, but most cases do not appear to be related to radiation therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. An association has been suggested between a parental occupation of farming (particularly if the mother farmed) and the development of Ewing sarcoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Ewing sarcoma may be more common in children who have hernias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/36-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-40</a>]. A meta-analysis of three case-control studies (totaling 357 patients with Ewing sarcoma and 745 controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>]) showed that affected children were more likely to have had a hernia in childhood (odds ratio 3.2, 95% CI 1.9-5.7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The association was strongest for umbilical hernias. The mechanism underlying a possible association between hernias and Ewing sarcoma is unclear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOGENESIS AND HISTOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (EFT) represent a spectrum of tumors that range from classic Ewing sarcoma (ES) to atypical ES and primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Histogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The histogenic origin of EFT has been debated over the years. A neuroectodermal origin had been proposed based upon variable expression of neuronal immunohistochemical markers, cytogenetic, and ultrastructural features, as well as the ability of ES cell lines to differentiate along neural pathways in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/10-12,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12,41,42</a>]. Because of the resemblance of PNET to classic neuroblastoma, the neural crest was regarded as the most likely progenitor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-pathology-of-neuroblastoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and pathology of neuroblastoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although ES is typically described as an undifferentiated tumor whose primitive cells lack neural differentiation, some tumors contain Homer-Wright rosettes, which are indicative of neural differentiation. Furthermore, ES can express neural antigens (eg, gastrin-releasing peptide, a protein which is normally expressed by the brain and neuroendocrine cells) on their surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>], and both ES and PNET synthesize choline acetyltransferase, a marker suggesting a common neural origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Histologic features'</a> below.)</p><p>Based upon these features and the lack of precursor synthesis for the adrenergic pathway, some investigators believe that EFT are derived from postganglionic parasympathetic primordial cells, which are located throughout the parasympathetic nervous system, accounting for their widespread distribution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/10,12,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12,43</a>]. In contrast, neuroblastomas synthesize neurotransmitters that are associated with the sympathetic autonomic nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/10,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,43</a>].</p><p>In contrast to this &quot;neural crest hypothesis,&quot; an alternative theory is emerging that suggests that EFT arise from mesenchymal progenitor or mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). MSCs isolated from bone marrow can differentiate into osteogenic, chondrogenic, or adipogenic lineages. Expression of the ES-specific oncoprotein EWS-FLI (see below) blocks MSC differentiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>], while removal of EWS-FLI from patient-derived ES cell lines allows the cells to gain the ability to differentiate into multiple lineages and adapt a gene expression profile that resembles that of MSCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Additional data will be required to draw a final conclusion as to the cell of origin in ES.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Histologic features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The morphologic appearance of classic ES is that of a primitive, undifferentiated neoplasm. On hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections, there are sheets of uniform, small, round, blue cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and scant cytoplasm, which is clear because of the presence of abundant glycogen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F63471\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63471 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. There is usually extensive necrosis, with preservation of viable tumor around blood vessels. Nuclear pleomorphism, palisading, and the formation of rosettes (where the tumor cells are arranged in a circle about a central fibrillary space, indicative of neural differentiation) or pseudorosettes are typically absent. Invasion of blood vessels can be seen, although the tumors are not characteristically highly vascular. Mitotic figures are rare, and aneuploidy is uncommon on flow cytometry studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Atypical ES represents a histologic variant of ES; they are described as having larger cells, a greater degree of cellular pleomorphism, and a higher mitotic rate (generally more than two mitoses per high-power field). Spindle cells may be present at the periphery, and these tumor cells invade the adjacent tissue in an infiltrative manner. The cells can be arranged in sheets, or there may be an organoid, lobular, or alveolar architectural pattern. As in typical ES, evidence of neural differentiation is usually absent.</p><p>The histopathologic features of a peripheral PNET may resemble typical ES or atypical ES; however, a neural immunophenotype or evidence of neural differentiation on light microscopic (ie, Flexner-type rosettes or Homer-Wright-type pseudorosettes) or ultrastructural examination is present in approximately one-half of cases. However, mature neural elements (ie, ganglion cells, nerve fascicles, or a neuropil background) are absent. The neoplastic cells are typically arranged into an organoid, alveolar, or lobular pattern.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Morphologically, the appearance of EFT and PNET tumors is similar to that of other small, round, blue cell tumors involving bone and soft tissue, including lymphoma, small cell osteosarcoma, mesenchymal chondrosarcoma, undifferentiated neuroblastoma, poorly differentiated synovial sarcoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumors, and rhabdomyosarcoma. As a group, these tumors can pose difficult diagnostic problems when examined by light microscopy alone. There is little in the routine histologic appearance of an EFT to relate it to a component of normal bone or other tissue from which it might have arisen. Even the determination of bone versus soft tissue origin can be challenging because EFT involving bone often have an extensive soft tissue component, while extraosseous tumors may invade bone secondarily.</p><p>Although ES can exhibit a variable degree of neural differentiation, this is usually subtle and often only detected by immunohistochemical staining for markers of neural differentiation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F78518\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78518 \">table 2</a>) or by ultrastructural examination. Although no routinely used histochemical or immunohistochemical stain can positively distinguish EFT from other undifferentiated small round cell tumors of childhood, the vast majority of EFT express high levels of a cell surface glycoprotein (designated CD99, MIC2 surface antigen or <span class=\"nowrap\">p30/32MIC2)</span> that is encoded by the <em>CD99</em> (<em>MIC2X</em>) gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/6,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,47</a>]. The finding of membrane-localized <em>MIC2</em> expression is a sensitive diagnostic marker for the EFT; however, it lacks specificity since other tumors (eg, rhabdomyosarcoma, which is often in the differential diagnosis) and normal tissues are also immunoreactive with anti-MIC2 antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Another new potential immunohistochemical marker for EFT is NKX2.2, the protein product of the <em>NKX2-2</em> gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>Cytogenetic or molecular genetic studies looking for particular chromosomal translocations <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> their fusion transcripts are usually required to secure the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Molecular diagnostics'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">MOLECULAR GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Remarkable progress has been made in defining and classifying bone and soft tissue tumors on the basis of characteristic chromosomal abnormalities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F64666\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64666 \">table 3</a>). Because of their unique shared chromosomal translocations, the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (EFT) have become a model system for nonmorphologic approaches to diagnosis and subclassification using both cytogenetic and molecular techniques. These translocations interrupt specific genes and recombine them to create novel fusion genes, whose products are tumor specific and present in virtually all cases of an individual tumor category. Thus, their characterization not only yields profound insights into tumor biology, but also holds great promise for diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.

Members of the ETS family are defined by the presence of a highly conserved 85-amino acid domain, termed the erythroblastosis virus-transforming sequence (ETS) domain, which mediates specific binding to purine-rich DNA sequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. As a result of the t(11;22), the EWS-FLI fusion protein is expressed. EWS-FLI binds DNA via its FLI-derived ETS domain and regulates gene expression through the EWS portion of the fusion.</p><p>In EFT that lack the EWSR1-FLI1 translocation, analogous translocations fuse the <em>EWSR1</em> gene to other genes of the ETS family (ie, <em>ERG</em>, <em>ETV1</em>, <em>ETV4</em>, or <em>FEV</em>) that have structural homology to FLI1, forming t(21;22)(q22;q12), t(7;22)(p22;q12), t(17;22)(q12;q12), or t(2;22)(q35;q12) translocations, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/58-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-61</a>]. The EWSR1-ERG translocation [t(21;22) (q22;q12)] is present in 5 to 10 percent of EFT, while the others are less common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/43,61-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,61-63</a>].</p><p>In addition to <em>EWSR1</em>-based translocations, rare cases of EFT are associated with translocations involving a related gene, <em>FUS</em> (also called <em>TLS</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>]. Tumors exhibiting t(16;21)(p11;q24) or t(2;16)(q35;p11) translocations express FUS-ERG or FUS-FEV fusions, respectively. Because EWS and FUS proteins are highly similar, it is believed that FUS-based fusion proteins function similarly to EWS-based fusions. It is important to note that tumors with these translocations can be a source of diagnostic confusion. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Molecular diagnostics'</a> below.)</p><p>Ultimately, specific translocations are important diagnostic features of the EFT, and the protein products of the fusion genes are believed to play an important role in tumor development and biology. A growing body of evidence suggests that these proteins function as transcriptional regulators, although their transcriptional targets are just beginning to be identified. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Molecular pathogenesis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">EWSR1 translocations in other soft tissue tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although translocations involving the <em>EWSR1</em> and <em>ETS </em>families of genes are specific for EFT, translocations that involve fusion of the <em>EWSR1 </em>gene to other genes have been observed in many other tumors (eg, clear cell <span class=\"nowrap\">sarcoma/malignant</span> melanoma of soft parts, desmoplastic small round cell tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/66-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-68</a>]). The structure of these resultant fusion genes is analogous to that of EWSR1-FLI1 (ie, all result in the fusion of the 5' portions of the <em>EWSR1</em> gene or an <em>EWSR1</em>-like gene [eg, the<em> FUS</em> gene] to 3' portions of genes encoding transcription factors). The resulting chimeric proteins presumably have a similar function to the EWS-FLI fusion protein, and it is thought that disruption of transcriptional control contributes to their transforming potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Molecular pathogenesis'</a> below.)</p><p>Despite these similarities, with few exceptions, a clinicopathologically distinct tumor entity has been consistently associated with each specific translocation involving a unique class of transcription factors. This tumor specificity is most likely related to cell-specific influences on DNA recombination, chimeric gene expression, and intrinsic proteins that are necessary to complement the action of the chimeric protein.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Other genetic changes in EFT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the characteristic reciprocal translocations described above, other numerical and structural chromosomal aberrations are occasionally found in EFT. These include a gain of chromosomes 1q, 2, 8, and 12, losses of 9p and 16q, and the nonreciprocal translocation t(1;16)(q12;q11.2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/69-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">69-71</a>]. In addition, alterations in known tumor suppressor genes have been identified in some cases. As an example, homozygous deletion of the<em> CDKN2A</em> gene has been described in 18 to 30 percent of cases, and <em>TP53 </em>mutations are detected in 5 to 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/45,72-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,72-74</a>]. Finally, loss-of-function mutations in <em>STAG2</em> have also been identified in more than 15 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/75-78\" class=\"abstract_t\">75-78</a>].</p><p>The biologic implications of these findings are incompletely understood and are somewhat controversial, with some studies suggesting an adverse prognostic impact of some of these alterations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/74-77\" class=\"abstract_t\">74-77</a>], while others have failed to confirm such a correlation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. More recently, loss-of-function alterations in <em>STAG2</em> have been identified and have also been suggested to be predictive of poor outcome in patients with EFT. At this time, however, these data are preliminary, and they require validation before any molecular test can be used to change clinical decision-making.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Molecular pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EFT-associated translocations result in the production of chimeric proteins that contain the amino-terminal domain of the normal EWS protein fused to the nucleic acid-binding domain of the transcription factor translocation partner. Because of their ubiquitous presence in EFT, they are thought to be intimately connected to the biology of these tumors.</p><p>The available data suggest two possible mechanisms by which these unique chimeric proteins may contribute to neoplastic transformation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cell growth:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chimeric proteins such as EWS-FLI may influence transcription of some of the same genes that are normally regulated by native FLI, but because the chimeric molecule is expressed in either a different temporal or quantitative manner, the downstream targets are deregulated, leading to uncontrolled cellular growth.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EWS-FLI may affect target genes that are different from those regulated by the native FLI or EWS proteins. This would explain why the chimeric gene product (EWS-FLI) has transforming properties that are not shared by either the EWS or FLI wild-type counterparts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].</p><p/><p>Some chimeric fusion proteins can act as transcriptional activators, deregulating many genes associated with cell signaling, proliferation, apoptosis, tissue invasion, and metastasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/45,80-87\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,80-87</a>]. It is likely that this ability to regulate transcriptional activity is associated with their oncogenic potential. EWS-FLI and other chimeric fusion proteins are all capable of transforming cell lines equally well. As an example, expression of either the EWS-FLI or EWS-ERG cDNAs can transform mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts so that they acquire tumor-like properties (eg, growth in soft agar or in immunodeficient mice) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/80,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,88</a>]. Notably, EWS-FLI can only transform cells in which insulin-like growth factor signaling is intact, and thus, there is a potential role for insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) inhibitors in the treatment of Ewing sarcoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/89-91\" class=\"abstract_t\">89-91</a>].</p><p>The protein products of the fused genes are also important for maintaining the growth characteristics of EFT cell lines, and emerging data suggest the potential for molecularly targeted therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Introduction of EWS-FLI RNA antisense molecules or short-interfering or short-hairpin RNAs (such as RNAi that mediate RNA-interference) into EFT cells decreases the expression of the EWS-FLI fusion protein and results in growth inhibition <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> loss of oncogenic potential, both in vitro and in vivo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/93-97\" class=\"abstract_t\">93-97</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Likewise, inhibition of the interaction between EWS-FLI and its cellular binding partner RNA helicase A (RHA) by a small peptide or small molecule inhibitor reduces the growth of EFT orthotopic xenografts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Truncated ETS domain-binding molecules can act as competitive inhibitors and have a dominant negative effect on cell growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. <span class=\"nowrap\">p21(WAF1/CIP1),</span> which is important in cell cycle regulation, might be one of the direct targets of EWS-FLI, suggesting that this molecule could serve as a target for a molecularly based therapy for EFT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>].</p><p/><p>Because EWS-FLI and related fusions are thought to function primarily as transcriptional regulators, a number of studies have sought to define the genes that are regulated by the fusion proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/95-97,100,101\" class=\"abstract_t\">95-97,100,101</a>]. Some of the EWS-FLI-regulated genes are involved in the oncogenic phenotype of Ewing sarcoma model systems (eg, <em>IGFBP3</em>, <em>CAV1</em>, <em>NKX2.2</em>, <em>NR0B1</em>, <em>GSTM4</em>, and others) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/82,95-97,102,103\" class=\"abstract_t\">82,95-97,102,103</a>]. While many of the details are still being worked out, some of these gene targets and associated pathways may prove to be future targets for molecularly targeted therapy.</p><p>Another mechanism whereby EWS-FLI may exert a tumorigenic effect is via deregulation of programmed cell death (apoptosis). Cancer is believed, in part, to represent an imbalance between cell growth and cell death. Expression of <em>EWS-FLI1</em> or <em>EWS-ERG</em> in NIH3T3 cells inhibits the apoptosis that would normally occur with serum deprivation or calcium ionophore treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>], while antisense inhibition of EWS-FLI increases susceptibility to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in ES cell lines. Similarly, reduced expression of EWS-FLI using RNAi-based approaches also resulted in increased apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].</p><p>EWS-ETS fusion proteins also activate human telomerase activity in Ewing tumors through upregulation of the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene expression, probably by acting as a transcriptional coactivator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein enzyme that compensates for telomere shortening during cell division by synthesizing telomeric DNA, thereby maintaining telomere length. In normal somatic cells, telomerase activity is usually undetectable, with the exception of some cell types, such as hematopoietic cells, hair follicles, intestinal crypt cells, and basal cells of the epidermis. Upregulated telomerase activity in cancer cells correlates with the stabilization of telomere length and cellular immortalization (ie, the ability of the cells to divide indefinitely). This raises the possibility of therapeutic approaches using telomerase inhibitors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Molecular diagnostics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The translocations that characterize EFT are exquisitely sensitive and specific tumor markers that have rapidly become the standard for confirming the diagnosis, particularly for cases in which morphology is inconclusive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/7,106\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,106</a>]. Standard cytogenetic analysis can reveal a wide variety of chromosomal alterations, but technical constraints and variant translocations may complicate the interpretation, and results are often obtained too late to influence therapy. Molecular assays are more attractive because of the small amount of tissue required, rapid results, and higher sensitivity than traditional cytogenetics.</p><p>Both the fusion genes and their hybrid transcripts can be identified in tumor cells using molecular genetic approaches. Two techniques are in use, FISH and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and both are more rapid than cytogenetic analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/107-110\" class=\"abstract_t\">107-110</a>]. In particular, RT-PCR to detect the presence of fusion transcripts in tumor cells has become a mainstay in molecular diagnosis of the EFT. It is extremely sensitive and specific, and allows detection of very low levels of tumor cells, even among large numbers of normal cells (eg, peripheral blood and bone marrow), providing an extremely robust method for molecular staging and monitoring treatment response. (See below.)</p><p>In addition to providing diagnostic support for challenging cases, the identification of specific types of transcripts was at one time thought to have prognostic significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/69,111,112\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,111,112</a>]. As an example, in one report, the presence of type 1 EWS-FLI transcripts (<em>EWSR1</em> exon 7 fused with <em>FLI1</em> exon 6) was associated with a threefold reduction in the risk of developing metastatic disease as compared with non-type 1 transcripts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]. However, more recent independent studies from both the United States and Europe do not support the prognostic value of translocation type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/113,114\" class=\"abstract_t\">113,114</a>]. It appears that current intensive treatment protocols may have eliminated this apparent difference in prognosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, staging, and prognostic factors of the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors&quot;, section on 'Prognostic factors'</a>.)</p><p>While molecular tests for EFT-associated translocations are important and often useful adjuncts in the diagnostic workup, in most cases, molecular pathology laboratories do not test for all of the &quot;alternate&quot; translocations (such as those that encode EWS-ETV1, EWS-ETV4, EWS-FEV, FUS-ERG, and FUS-FEV). Thus, a &quot;negative&quot; FISH or RT-PCR result does not necessarily rule out the diagnosis of EFT. Physicians are strongly advised to consult with their molecular diagnostic laboratory to understand exactly what tests are performed and the sensitivity and specificity of those tests for EFT. Ultimately, the diagnosis of EFT is based upon a combination of histopathology, immunohistochemical stains, and molecular diagnostics that are interpreted in the context of the patient's clinical presentation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Molecular staging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Disease stage as determined by standard imaging modalities constitutes the most powerful predictor of prognosis for patients with EFT.

Because of their similar histologic and immunohistochemical characteristics and shared nonrandom chromosomal translocations, these tumors are considered to be derived from a common cell of origin, although its histogenic origin is debated. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p>Although rare, the EFT represent the second most common primary bone malignancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F81481\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81481 \">table 1</a>) affecting children and adolescents. EFT have not been consistently associated with any familial or congenital syndromes, and specific environmental exposures have not been identified as risk factors. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p>Morphologically, the appearance of EFT is similar to that of other small, round, blue cell tumors involving bone and soft tissue, including lymphoma, small cell osteosarcoma, mesenchymal chondrosarcoma, undifferentiated neuroblastoma, poorly differentiated synovial sarcoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumors, and rhabdomyosarcoma. As a group, these tumors often pose difficult diagnostic problems when examined by light microscopy alone. Cytogenetic or molecular genetic studies looking for particular chromosomal translocations <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> their fusion transcripts are usually required to secure the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Molecular diagnostics'</a> above.)</p><p>Virtually all cases express one of several different reciprocal translocations, most of which involve breakpoints that are clustered within a single gene locus, designated the<em> EWSR1</em> gene on chromosome 22q12. EFT-associated translocations result in the production of chimeric proteins that contain the amino-terminal domain of the normal EWS protein fused to the nucleic acid-binding domain of the transcription factor translocation partner. Because of their ubiquitous presence in EFT, these chimeric proteins are thought to be intimately connected to the biology of these tumors.
