The management of patients with EDS depends largely upon common principles and practices, with an emphasis on patient education for the prevention and early recognition of injuries and complications. Management of EDS also includes monitoring and additional interventions tailored to the particular manifestations or complications that may occur with each form of EDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-ehlers-danlos-syndromes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>There are no medical treatments that can reverse or &ldquo;cure&rdquo; EDS, and most other interventions used in these patients have not been evaluated in randomized trials. (See <a href=\"#H15176563\" class=\"local\">'Common management approaches'</a> below and <a href=\"#H15176575\" class=\"local\">'Management by EDS type'</a> below.)</p><p>An overview of the approach to the management, monitoring, and prognosis of patients with EDS will be presented here. The information provided in this topic review is intended to allow primary care providers and other non-EDS specialists to educate and support patients with EDS and to coordinate care and referrals to appropriate specialists, depending upon the type and severity of EDS. Patients with EDS should be managed in collaboration with an expert in clinical genetics. (See <a href=\"#H6257389\" class=\"local\">'When to refer'</a> below.)</p><p>The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of the major forms of EDS, and a detailed discussion of the management of the joint hypermobility syndrome, are presented separately.

The particular approaches specific to each type of EDS are described below.

Additionally, the clinical geneticist and other EDS specialists have a role in educating the other members of the health care team, given the relative rarity of these disorders in most practice settings.

(See <a href=\"#H12211492\" class=\"local\">'Worrisome symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Patients with vascular EDS (EDS Type IV) should be advised to obtain a medical alert device, such as a bracelet or necklace, which indicates their diagnosis and possible complications to facilitate appropriate emergency medical care. Other patients with risk of vascular and other acute events, including patients with the classic and kyphoscoliosis types (EDS types I and VI, respectively), may also benefit from use of such a device. Patients in North America can enroll in MedicAlert by calling (800) 432-5372 or through the internet at <a href=\"http://www.medicalert.org/&amp;token=5yvz7lCf0hefbc5ZhmpaTbTbwuWhpPBvF7yeHgTwlEHp6x6+VwH6cgp116pr7mDa&amp;TOPIC_ID=89916\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.medicalert.org</a> (United States) and <a href=\"http://www.medicalert.ca/&amp;token=5yvz7lCf0hefbc5ZhmpaTXVI0ayk97wRAbQo7RihRrYEnHfYxrEmT9GC3taU12uW&amp;TOPIC_ID=89916\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.medicalert.ca</a> (Canada).

We try to help patients to maintain a positive attitude, follow recommendations for joint protection and pain management, and choose physical activities that are appropriate for their condition (see <a href=\"#H12211468\" class=\"local\">'Joint protection and function'</a> below and <a href=\"#H12211480\" class=\"local\">'Musculoskeletal pain'</a> below). Patients also benefit, in our experience, from reassurance that EDS may be associated with chronic pain, which is &ldquo;real&rdquo; and not &ldquo;all in their head.&rdquo;</p><p>Many patients may be adversely affected by the limitations posed by EDS (eg, those whose work or recreational activities requires heavy lifting). Patients who have pursued activities enhanced by their hypermobility (eg, professional ballerinas, competitive dancers, gymnasts, college athletes dependent upon sports scholarships) may be in particular need of psychosocial support.</p><p>Patients with chronic pain, anxiety, and depression, which are more common in individuals with joint hypermobility, may benefit from a multidisciplinary treatment program emphasizing functional recovery that includes cognitive behavioral therapy techniques, physical therapy, and education regarding their condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-ehlers-danlos-syndromes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Such strategies may help to improve physical function, self-efficacy, and mood, and may reduce the need for analgesics. Participation in psychotherapeutic group interventions may also improve patient wellbeing. As an example, in one study a group of 12 women with generalized joint hypermobility were offered interventions including physical and cognitive-behavioral therapy as a group program; this program included an inpatient rehabilitation program with testing, physical therapy, group discussions, and lectures, followed by in-home physical therapy, then a brief inpatient stay for testing and retraining [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-ehlers-danlos-syndromes/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Participants reported improved performance of daily activities, increased muscle strength and endurance, and decreased kinesophobia (fear of movement and injury or re-injury), although self-reported pain levels were not significantly changed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-psychotherapies#H432862147\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of psychotherapies&quot;, section on 'Cognitive and behavioral therapies'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-psychotherapies#H158682540\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of psychotherapies&quot;, section on 'Group therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12211468\"><span class=\"h2\">Joint protection and function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with joint hypermobility should be referred for physical and occupational therapy evaluation and management; in addition, we advise patients regarding steps they can take on their own to optimize function, relieve symptoms, and prevent injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F91738\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91738 \">table 1</a>). An important objective for many patients, particularly those with the classic and hypermobility forms of EDS, should be to &ldquo;preserve and protect&rdquo; joint function, with the goal of preventing recurrent joint dislocations, chronic joint pain, and early onset of osteoarthritis. Prevention is of particular value because orthopaedic procedures and other surgery may take longer than expected to heal, and many patients undergo repeated orthopaedic procedures as their connective tissues increase in laxity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-ehlers-danlos-syndromes/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>A low-impact muscle-strengthening program for joint protection and appropriate use of assistive devices (such as a cane or lightweight collapsible walking stick; or lightweight orthoses, such as braces or splints) can be of particular benefit. Evaluation by a pedorthist or podiatrist is of benefit to assess the need for arch supports or other orthotics. In one series of 79 patients in Belgium with hypermobility EDS, of the half who were enrolled in a physical therapy program, 63 percent reported benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-ehlers-danlos-syndromes/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Patients can take a number of precautions and other actions in their daily activities, including measures to optimize function, relieve symptoms, and prevent injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F91738\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91738 \">table 1</a>), in addition to participating in physical and occupational therapy. These measures should be individualized according to the patient&rsquo;s clinical manifestations. Activities which are joint-sparing, such as swimming, should be encouraged; by contrast, contact sports and repetitive activities which stress the joints, such as running and weightlifting, should be avoided. Patients may also be attracted to activities in which their flexibility is a particular advantage, such as gymnastics, but these activities increase the risk of joint injury and earlier development of arthritis. For patients with EDS, the opposite of &ldquo;no pain, no gain&rdquo; is true; sports and activities which may have already contributed to joint damage at the time of diagnosis should be replaced with noncompetitive biking, swimming, and walking. Additionally, patients with substantial joint laxity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> recurrent dislocations should avoid carrying items weighing more than about 5 pounds (about 2.25 kg). These strategies are useful, in our experience, but have not been systematically evaluated in clinical trials.</p><p>&ldquo;Mind-body&rdquo; techniques, such as tai chi, may also be useful for enhancing function and reducing pain. Although they have not been systematically evaluated inpatient with EDS, they appear to be helpful in patients with other disorders, such as fibromyalgia and low back pain.

Pharmacologic treatment of joint pain involves the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> and, if necessary, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); but the latter agents, which may diminish platelet function, should generally be avoided in patients with easy bruising.</p><p>Some patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain benefit from use of meditation or other relaxation techniques. Those with symptoms and findings compatible with fibromyalgia syndrome, such as chronic widespread pain, fatigue, nonrestorative sleep, and cognitive disturbance, may benefit from treatments used in this condition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of fibromyalgia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults-not-responsive-to-initial-therapies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of fibromyalgia in adults not responsive to initial therapies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fibromyalgia in children and adolescents: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In one study, pain management strategies perceived as most effective by patients with EDS included massage therapy, splints or braces, and heat therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-ehlers-danlos-syndromes/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Other strategies included using regular exercise, diet management (to avoid excess weight), avoidance of potentially harmful activities, and counseling. Physical therapy was used more by patients with hypermobile EDS than by those with classic or vascular forms of EDS. In addition, patients viewed pharmacologic treatment, especially with opioids, as effective.</p><p>Patients with refractory pain may require referral for further evaluation in a pain clinic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some patients with EDS, such as those with symptoms of Raynaud phenomenon (especially cold or painful hands and feet), feel better in warmer, more humid climates and may benefit from medical therapy for Raynaud phenomenon.

In addition, sleep-disordered breathing may occur frequently in patients with EDS and may be under-recognized and a possible cause of fatigue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-ehlers-danlos-syndromes/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This should be considered in the care of EDS patients; if suspected, patient should be referred to a sleep specialist for further evaluation.

The following approaches may be useful, according to experts and in our experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-ehlers-danlos-syndromes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because wound healing is abnormal and there is an increased risk of dehiscence, experts generally suggest that skin wounds should be closed in two layers, when possible, and there should be generous suturing of deep wounds to aid in wound healing. Sutures should generally remain in for twice as long as is typical for a given procedure. Taping can help prevent stretching of the scar.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals with significant skin fragility, particularly children, may decrease the risk of developing skin lacerations by the use of protective bandages or pads over especially exposed areas, such as the knees, shins, and forehead.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with easy bruising should avoid heavy exercise, contact sports, and the use of medications that may decrease platelet function, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and most NSAIDs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with easy bruising or skin fragility, the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-c-ascorbic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin C</a> (in doses ranging from 1 to 4 grams daily in adults) has been advocated by some experts in an effort to decrease bruising and improve wound healing, especially in patients with the kyphoscoliosis and vascular types of EDS, although this approach has not been formally tested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-ehlers-danlos-syndromes/abstract/1,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8,9</a>]. Some experts also suggest vitamin C in patients with hypermobility EDS as well, but limit the dose of vitamin C to 500 mg daily in such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-ehlers-danlos-syndromes/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12211492\"><span class=\"h2\">Worrisome symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain symptoms should prompt suspicion for potential serious complications of EDS.

We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on &ldquo;patient info&rdquo; and the keyword(s) of interest.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Basics topics (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ehlers-danlos-syndrome-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (The Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15176973\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) should be cared for in close collaboration with an expert in clinical genetics and other EDS specialists, including experts in cardiovascular disease, orthopedic surgery, ophthalmology, and behavioral medicine, depending upon the type and severity of EDS and the specific clinical manifestations. Patient education and counseling includes the nature of the condition and absence of cure; strategies for the recognition, prevention, and reduction of symptoms; genetic counseling; and counseling regarding the risks of pregnancy and childbirth. (See <a href=\"#H15176563\" class=\"local\">'Common management approaches'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6257389\" class=\"local\">'When to refer'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19326553\" class=\"local\">'Patient education'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12211395\" class=\"local\">'Psychosocial support'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with joint hypermobility (eg, classic and hypermobility EDS) should be referred for physical and occupational therapy evaluation and management, and advised regarding steps they can take on their own to optimize function, relieve symptoms, and prevent injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F91738\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91738 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H12211468\" class=\"local\">'Joint protection and function'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12211480\" class=\"local\">'Musculoskeletal pain'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Special precautions may be required for wound healing in patients with hyperelasticity or fragility of skin (eg, classic, vascular, and kyphoscoliosis EDS), including closing wounds in two layers with generous suturing; keeping sutures in for twice as long as is typical; and prevention of injury with use of protective bandages or pads over exposed areas. Precautions in patients with easy bruising include avoidance of trauma or medications that increase the risk of bleeding and the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-c-ascorbic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin C</a> in selected patients, including those with the kyphoscoliosis and vascular types of EDS. (See <a href=\"#H12211486\" class=\"local\">'Skin fragility, wound management, and easy bruising'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms that should increase suspicion of potential complications and indicate a need for urgent evaluation include sudden onset of unexplained pain, bleeding, or dyspnea; acute chest pain; orthostatic intolerance; and visual loss. (See <a href=\"#H12211492\" class=\"local\">'Worrisome symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with EDS should undergo baseline cardiovascular evaluation, including echocardiography, for detection of cardiac involvement, including valvular disease; and ophthalmologic examination. The frequency of monitoring depends upon the type of EDS and presence or absence of clinical findings. Patients with EDS who develop scoliosis, peripheral neuropathy, or new neck pain should be evaluated and monitored as needed by an expert in spine care. (See <a href=\"#H6256182\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management strategies required in patients with EDS differ to some degree between EDS types, and should be individualized depending upon the severity of disease and the specific manifestations caused by the underlying genetic disorder. Some of these issues will impact the approach to usual medical care for other comorbid illnesses. Other management strategies may be common to most forms of EDS, but should still be tailored to the type of EDS and individual manifestations. (See <a href=\"#H15176575\" class=\"local\">'Management by EDS type'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be provided with appropriate education, genetic and other counseling, support, and medical consultation to help facilitate individualized decision-making regarding pregnancy and family planning. Premature delivery due to cervical insufficiency or premature rupture of membranes is common, and patients with EDS should be considered at high risk and followed by a maternal-fetal-medicine specialist for these and other potential complications. Patients with vascular EDS are at high risk for uterine and vascular ruptures. (See <a href=\"#H98600961\" class=\"local\">'Counseling and genetic testing'</a> above and <a href=\"#H98600967\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EDS generally results in slowly progressive changes. The prognosis depends upon the type of EDS and the severity with which the individual patient is affected. The lifespan for patients with the classic and hypermobility forms is not decreased; by contrast, survival is shortened in forms of EDS with vascular involvement (eg, vascular and kyphoscoliosis EDS), and 80 percent of patients with vascular EDS experience a major adverse disease-related event by age 40. (See <a href=\"#H15176623\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-ehlers-danlos-syndromes/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Callewaert B, Malfait F, Loeys B, De Paepe A.
