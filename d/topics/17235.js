Many of them have low serum concentrations of both thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), and their serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration also may be low. Previously, these patients were thought to be euthyroid, and the term <strong>euthyroid-sick syndrome</strong> was used to describe the laboratory abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-function-in-nonthyroidal-illness/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, there is evidence that these patients may have acquired transient central hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-function-in-nonthyroidal-illness/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Despite these abnormalities, treatment of these patients with thyroid hormone, while controversial, appears to be of little benefit and may be harmful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-function-in-nonthyroidal-illness/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. It is possible that the changes in thyroid function during severe illness are <strong>protective</strong> in that they prevent excessive tissue catabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-function-in-nonthyroidal-illness/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the changes in thyroid hormone and TSH metabolism that can occur in patients with nonthyroidal illness. The utility of the different tests to assess thyroid function is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-assessment-of-thyroid-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory assessment of thyroid function&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are two important general principles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-function-in-nonthyroidal-illness/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thyroid function should not be assessed in seriously ill patients unless there is a strong suspicion of thyroid dysfunction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When thyroid dysfunction is suspected in critically ill patients, measurement of serum TSH alone is inadequate for the evaluation of thyroid function.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">LOW SERUM T3</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of hospitalized patients have low serum triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations, as do some outpatients who are ill (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F61095\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61095 \">figure 1</a>). Unlike T4, which is produced solely within the thyroid, 80 percent of circulating T3 is produced by the peripheral 5'-deiodination of T4 to T3, a reaction catalyzed by 5'-monodeiodinases (D1 and D2) in organs such as muscle, liver, and kidney (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F57919\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57919 \">figure 2</a>). 5'-monodeiodination decreases whenever caloric intake is low and in any nonthyroidal illness, even mild illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-function-in-nonthyroidal-illness/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Liver and skeletal muscle biopsies obtained within minutes after death from intensive care unit (ICU) patients demonstrate reduced 5'-monodeiodinase activity and increased 5'-monodeiodinase (D3) activity (which converts T4 to reverse T3 [rT3]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-function-in-nonthyroidal-illness/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Patients with fatal illness have low tissue T4 and T3 concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-function-in-nonthyroidal-illness/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>Several mechanisms can contribute to the inhibition of 5'-monodeiodination and therefore to the low serum T3 concentrations in patients with nonthyroidal illness.

It is, however, useful to measure serum T3 in hospitalized patients who have a low serum TSH concentration in whom the differential diagnosis is hyperthyroidism versus nonthyroidal illness (as an example, in a sick patient with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation). The serum T3 value should be high (or high normal) in hyperthyroidism, but low (or low normal) in nonthyroidal illness. Rarely, a very sick patient with hyperthyroidism will have a low serum T3 concentration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism#H1437846\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of hyperthyroidism&quot;, section on 'Critically ill patients'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Reverse T3</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>rT3 is the product of 5-monodeiodination of T4 (D3) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F57919\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57919 \">figure 2</a>); D3 is induced in nonthyroidal illness, especially in the setting of hypoxia or ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-function-in-nonthyroidal-illness/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The clearance of rT3 to diiodothyronine (T2) is reduced in nonthyroidal illness because of inhibition of the 5'-monodeiodinase activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-function-in-nonthyroidal-illness/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. As a result, serum rT3 concentrations are high in patients with nonthyroidal illnesses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F61095\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61095 \">figure 1</a>), except in those with renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-function-in-nonthyroidal-illness/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>] and in some with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-function-in-nonthyroidal-illness/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroid-hormone-synthesis-and-physiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thyroid hormone synthesis and physiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">When to measure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measurement of serum rT3 is occasionally useful in hospitalized patients to distinguish between nonthyroidal illness and central hypothyroidism; the values are low in the latter patients because of low production of the substrate (T4) for rT3. In patients with mild hypothyroidism, however, serum rT3 concentrations may be normal or even slightly high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-function-in-nonthyroidal-illness/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], limiting its usefulness.</p><p>Thyroxine sulfate (T4S) is also elevated in critical nonthyroidal illness and correlates with reduced hepatic 5'-monodeiodination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-function-in-nonthyroidal-illness/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">LOW SERUM T4</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>From 15 to 20 percent of hospitalized patients and up to 50 percent of patients in intensive care units (ICUs) have low serum thyroxine (T4) concentrations (low T4 syndrome) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F61095\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61095 \">figure 1</a>). The concentrations are low primarily because of reductions in the serum concentrations of one or more of the three thyroid hormone-binding proteins: thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), transthyretin (TTR, or thyroxine-binding prealbumin [TBPA]), and albumin. Since TBG is the major binding protein, low serum T4 values are likely the result of decreased production of normal TBG or production of TBG that binds T4 poorly because it is abnormally glycosylated or is cleaved in the circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-function-in-nonthyroidal-illness/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Free T4</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Small reductions in binding proteins should not alter serum free thyroxine (T4) index or direct free T4 values, and these values are usually normal in patients whose illness is not severe. However, when the concentrations of binding proteins are very low, the T3-resin uptake test (and therefore the calculated thyroid hormone-binding ratio) fails to correct for the binding-protein deficiency adequately, and the serum free T4 index is low (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F61095\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61095 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-function-in-nonthyroidal-illness/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The effects of nonthyroidal illness and drugs on &quot;direct&quot; free T4 measurements may be method dependent and result in low values (or occasionally spuriously high values), leading one expert in this field to conclude: &quot;Despite the theoretical attraction of measuring the concentration of free or biologically active hormone, it remains uncertain whether current free T4 methodology is any improvement over an uncontentious measurement of total T4&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-function-in-nonthyroidal-illness/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The different thyroid function tests are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-assessment-of-thyroid-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory assessment of thyroid function&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An additional problem occurs in patients with more critical illness because some of them have circulating substances that inhibit T4 binding to the binding proteins (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Inhibitors of T4 binding'</a> below). The result is a further reduction in serum total T4 concentrations and, frequently, low serum free T4 concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-function-in-nonthyroidal-illness/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] and low serum free T4 index values. However, the serum free T4 fraction measured by equilibrium dialysis may be normal or even slightly high in these patients&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-function-in-nonthyroidal-illness/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In one study, as an example, none of 25 patients with nonthyroidal illness had a low serum concentration of free T4 by equilibrium dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-function-in-nonthyroidal-illness/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Inhibitors of T4 binding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Controversy exists as to the cause and importance of inhibitors of thyroxine (T4) binding to its binding proteins in patients with nonthyroidal illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-function-in-nonthyroidal-illness/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Some data support the possibility that high serum free fatty acid concentrations inhibit T4 binding to serum proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-function-in-nonthyroidal-illness/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Serum free fatty acid, particularly oleic acid, concentrations may be high in critically ill patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-function-in-nonthyroidal-illness/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], and their effect on T4 binding may be increased because of hypoalbuminemia, because albumin is the major carrier of free fatty acids in serum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-function-in-nonthyroidal-illness/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. However, this phenomenon may be an in vitro effect of fatty acids released during collection and transport of the serum sample [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-function-in-nonthyroidal-illness/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Inhibitors may also interfere with the T3-resin uptake test by interacting with the solid matrices used in the test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-function-in-nonthyroidal-illness/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Transient central hypothyroidism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with severe nonthyroidal illness may have acquired transient central hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-function-in-nonthyroidal-illness/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

In a second trial, administration of T4 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levothyroxine</a>) to 23 critically ill patients with low serum T4 concentrations did not alter either mortality or outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-function-in-nonthyroidal-illness/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Coronary artery bypass surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During and after cardiopulmonary bypass, there is a transient decrease in serum T3 concentrations, which may contribute to postoperative hemodynamic problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-function-in-nonthyroidal-illness/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. While animal data and anecdotal clinical experience had suggested that T3 repletion might improve outcomes after cardiopulmonary bypass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-function-in-nonthyroidal-illness/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>], clinical trials have not demonstrated such a benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-function-in-nonthyroidal-illness/abstract/58-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-60</a>]. In a systematic review of 14 randomized trials evaluating the administration of T3 in euthyroid adult patients in the immediate postoperative period (13 cardiac surgery, one renal transplantation), intravenous (IV) T3 administration increased cardiac index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-function-in-nonthyroidal-illness/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Mortality was not affected by high-dose IV T3 and could not be assessed for low dose IV or oral T3. In one of the trials included in the meta-analysis, 142 patients with coronary heart disease undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) were randomly assigned to intravenous T3 therapy (0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> bolus followed by an infusion of 0.113 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/hour</span> for six hours) at the completion of surgery or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-function-in-nonthyroidal-illness/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Although the mean cardiac index was higher and systemic vascular resistance was lower in the T3 group compared with placebo, there were no differences in the incidence of arrhythmia, need for inotropic or vasodilator drugs during the 24 hours after surgery, or in perioperative morbidity and mortality. A subsequent randomized, controlled trial using oral T3, 20 mcg every 12 hours, also failed to demonstrate a clinical benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-function-in-nonthyroidal-illness/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p>In summary, there is no evidence that thyroid hormone replacement is beneficial for patients with critical illness who have low serum T4 or T3 concentrations, or for patients undergoing CABG, whose serum T3 concentrations are known to decrease in the perioperative period. If, however, there is evidence to support a diagnosis of hypothyroidism (such as TSH over 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> with low free T4 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> history, symptoms, and signs of hypothyroidism), cautious administration of thyroid hormone is appropriate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26121582\"><span class=\"h2\">N-acetylcysteine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>N-acetylcysteine is an antioxidant that prevents reductions in glutathione, a co-factor of the D1 deiodinase.

Many of them have low serum concentrations of thyroxine (T4), free T4, and triiodothyronine (T3), and their serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations may also be low.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">When to test</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that thyroid function tests not be measured on seriously ill patients unless there is a strong suspicion of thyroid dysfunction.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">What to test</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When thyroid dysfunction is suspected in critically ill patients, measurement of serum TSH alone is inadequate for the evaluation of thyroid function. In this case, we suggest measurement of a full thyroid panel including a total T4, a free T4, and a T3. However, the diagnosis may still be in doubt. All methods for assessing free T4 levels are unreliable in severe critical illness; a free T4 by equilibrium dialysis sent to a reference lab would be the least likely to provide spurious results. Some experts argue a total T4 is of similar utility, at considerably less cost.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In critically ill patients with low serum T3 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> low T4 concentrations and no other clinical signs of hypothyroidism, we suggest <strong>not</strong> treating with thyroid hormone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Critical illness'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In previously euthyroid patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), we recommend <strong>not</strong> treating with thyroid hormone in the immediate postoperative period (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>).

In the absence of suspected myxedema coma, repletion should be cautious, beginning with approximately half the expected full replacement dose of T4 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levothyroxine</a>).
