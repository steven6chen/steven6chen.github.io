The tumor cells typically express cytoplasmic CD3 and do not express CD4; most cases are also CD8 negative. Large cells within the tumor infiltrate are frequently CD30 positive, and virtually all cases are also positive for CD103, which is a sensitive (but not specific) marker. CD56 is negative. Clonal rearrangements of the TCR beta and gamma genes are present, and some cases express TCR beta protein; by contrast, immunohistochemical stains for TCR delta are negative.</p><p>Since celiac disease is underdiagnosed in certain populations, it has been suggested that patients with a T cell lymphoma <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a gut primary localization should be tested for underlying celiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-enteropathy-associated-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

There were variable findings on endoscopy including polyps, erosions, and erythema. Biopsy demonstrated expansion of the lamina propria with a dense, band-like nondestructive lymphoid infiltrate that sometimes extended into the muscularis mucosae and submucosa with displacement and distortion of mucosal glands. The infiltrate was predominantly comprised of small, monotonous lymphoid cells with slightly irregular nuclei, mature nuclear chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli, and scant pale cytoplasm.

The diagnosis of gamma-delta T cell lymphoma is usually made based upon biopsy specimens demonstrating infiltrating atypical lymphocytes that express CD2, surface CD3, CD7, CD56, and TCRdelta, and do not express CD4, CD5, CD8 or B cell markers (eg, CD20).

On immunohistochemistry there is a homogeneous and strong expression of CD30 in a membrane and golgi pattern. There is also expression of T cell antigens or, in the case of the null cell type, lack of expression of lineage-specific antigens.

Mantle cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma often produce multiple polyp-like extensions of the mucosa (lymphomatoid polyposis), a gross appearance that is not seen in EATL.

While some patients present with limited stage disease, dissemination to the liver, spleen, skin, and other organs is common as the disease progresses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-enteropathy-associated-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Many patients die from complications of multifocal intestinal perforation due to refractory malignant ulcers. Occasional patients with localized disease are cured after surgical resection and there are reports of long term survival following hematopoietic cell transplantation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-peripheral-t-cell-lymphoma#H1885370809\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of peripheral T cell lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Enteropathy-associated T cell intestinal lymphoma'</a>.)</p><p>An international series of 62 patients with EATL with a median follow-up of 10.5 months reported a median overall survival of 10 months and a failure-free survival of six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-enteropathy-associated-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Estimated rates of overall and failure-free survival at five years were 20 and 4 percent, respectively. The International Prognostic Index developed for B cell lymphomas was not a good predictor of prognosis in this population.

On gross examination there are multiple, circumferentially-oriented jejunal ulcers, often associated with gut perforation. The tumor cells that invade the intestinal wall are variable in size and morphology. Most tumor cells express pan-T antigens (surface CD3 and CD7) and CD103. CD4, CD5, and CD8 are usually not expressed. The T cell receptor beta gene is clonally rearranged. Adjacent mucosa may or may not show signs of celiac disease.
