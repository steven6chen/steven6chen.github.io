Hysterectomy can also be performed by combining two of these four routes, such as in laparoscopically-assisted vaginal hysterectomy or laparoscopic hysterectomy combined with a mini-laparotomy to remove the uterine specimen from the peritoneal cavity. Hysterectomy has been associated with improvements in physical and mental quality-of-life measures, body image, and aspects of sexual activity, with few differences among surgical routes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-route-of-hysterectomy-for-benign-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>This topic review will review the data and clinical issues that impact selection of hysterectomy route.

In the absence of a life-threatening emergency (eg, uterine hemorrhage), the decision to proceed with hysterectomy is made mutually by the woman and her clinician based upon her functional impairment, childbearing plans, response to medical therapy, discussion of alternatives, and perception that the risks of the procedure are outweighed by the expected benefits.</p><p>The most common indications for hysterectomy and surgical approach in 2010 are shown in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F90709\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90709 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H348105990\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT ALTERNATIVES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medical and surgical alternatives to hysterectomy depend upon the underlying disorder.

In addition, there is a small risk of finding a malignancy at the time of hysterectomy for benign disease. The risk of an unexpected gynecologic cancer at the time of vaginal hysterectomy done for pelvic organ prolapse has been ranges between 0.3 and 0.8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-route-of-hysterectomy-for-benign-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

If a vaginal hysterectomy is not feasible because of limited vaginal access, the size of the uterus, or major adhesive disease, then laparoscopic hysterectomy is performed.

In a 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis of 47 randomized trials comparing abdominal hysterectomy, laparoscopic hysterectomy, and vaginal hysterectomy, including over 5000 women, vaginal hysterectomy had the best outcomes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F53367\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53367 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-route-of-hysterectomy-for-benign-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal hysterectomy versus abdominal hysterectomy: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Quicker return to normal activities by approximately 12 days</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Reduction of hospital stay by approximately one day</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal hysterectomy versus total laparoscopic hysterectomy (ie, the entire surgery is performed laparoscopically):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An average of 17 minutes shorter operating time for vaginal hysterectomy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A subsequent meta-analysis that included 24 articles (trials and observational studies) confirmed the shorter operative time (mean difference 42 minutes, 95% CI 29- 56) with vaginal hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-route-of-hysterectomy-for-benign-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The meta-analysis also reported a higher risk of vaginal cuff dehiscence (OR 6.3, 95% CI 2.4- 16.6) and conversion to laparotomy (OR 3.9, 95% CI 2.2-6.9) with total laparoscopic compared with vaginal hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-route-of-hysterectomy-for-benign-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Of note, the women undergoing total laparoscopic hysterectomy had lower postoperative pain scores on visual analogue scale (mean difference -1.08, 95% CI -1.7 to -0.42) and required less analgesia for a shorter period of time (MD -0.64 days, 95% CI -1.06 to -0.22), although these differences are less likely to be clinically important.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13021426\"><span class=\"h3\">Laparoscopic hysterectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When vaginal hysterectomy is not possible, laparoscopic hysterectomy has several advantages over the abdominal route, but also has a longer operative time and an increased risk of urinary tract injury. A meta-analysis of 21 randomized trials that comprised a variety of laparoscopic hysterectomy techniques, including laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy, laparoscopic hysterectomy with a vaginal cuff closure, total laparoscopic hysterectomy, single-port laparoscopic hysterectomy, and minilaparoscopy (defined as port sites not exceeding 3 mm) reported the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-route-of-hysterectomy-for-benign-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Outcomes favoring laparoscopic hysterectomy compared with abdominal hysterectomy:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Quicker return to normal activities by over 15 days</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Shorter hospital admission by one to three days, depending on type of laparoscopic hysterectomy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Reduction in wound or abdominal wall infection by approximately 70 percent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Outcomes that were worse for laparoscopic hysterectomy compared with abdominal hysterectomy:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Twofold increased risk of urinary tract (bladder or ureter) injuries</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Approximately 30 minute longer operative time</p><p/><p>Consensus guidelines regarding optimal type of laparoscopic hysterectomy and patient population are not available. Circumstances in which the laparoscopic approach can be helpful include hysterectomy in a patient with documented endometriosis, chronic pelvic pain, known pelvic adhesive disease, or a concurrent benign adnexal mass that requires removal. Laparoscopic hysterectomy is particularly useful in patients with limited vaginal access, a fixed immobile uterus, and in those women who desire supracervical hysterectomy. For enlarged uteri, no studies have compared the use of laparoscopic hysterectomy with morcellation versus vaginal hysterectomy with morcellation.</p><p>When planning for laparoscopic hysterectomy, the surgeon must confirm that laparoscopy is technically possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-route-of-hysterectomy-for-benign-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The American Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopists has defined contraindications to laparoscopic hysterectomy as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Significant cardiopulmonary disease with intolerance to increased intraperitoneal pressure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suspicion of malignancy when morcellation would be required</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13021247\"><span class=\"h3\">Single-port laparoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the vaginal route is the preferred approach for hysterectomy, other approaches and variations have been developed. One such example is single-port laparoscopy, a variant of the conventional laparoscopic technique. However, when compared with traditional laparoscopy for hysterectomy, single-port surgery can be more technically challenging to perform. In addition, a meta-analysis of randomized trials found that single-port laparoscopy offered no advantages over traditional laparoscopic techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-route-of-hysterectomy-for-benign-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Thus, traditional laparoscopic hysterectomy remains the technique of choice if vaginal hysterectomy is not feasible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-access-techniques-used-in-laparoscopic-surgery#H376701701\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal access techniques used in laparoscopic surgery&quot;, section on 'Single-incision surgery (SIS)'</a>.)</p><p>The proposed benefit of single-port laparoscopy is that a single incision is preferred by some women for cosmetic reasons. As the operative outcomes are not worse for single-port laparoscopy compared with traditional laparoscopy, single-port laparoscopy is an option for women who prioritize a single incision for cosmesis. More data are needed to define other patient groups who may benefit from single-port laparoscopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H801890443\"><span class=\"h3\">Robot-assisted hysterectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Robot-assisted laparoscopy, a variation on the conventional laparoscopic technique, has been used for hysterectomy but has not been reported to improve surgical outcomes compared with traditional laparoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-route-of-hysterectomy-for-benign-disease/abstract/7,10-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10-15</a>]. As such, conventional laparoscopic hysterectomy is preferred to robot-assisted hysterectomy when the vaginal approach is not feasible. However, because robot-assisted laparoscopy provides improved visualization with three-dimensional imaging, better mechanics, improved ergonomics, and an easier and faster learning curve for many surgeons, and has similar outcomes compared with traditional laparoscopy, it may be helpful for avoiding open abdominal hysterectomy or in select populations, such as the very obese or those with severe pelvic adhesive disease. Disadvantages include the need for additional surgical training, loss of haptic feedback, and cost. More data are needed to define the patient groups who may benefit from this technology. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=robot-assisted-laparoscopy#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Robot-assisted laparoscopy&quot;, section on 'Robotic versus other surgical approaches'</a>.)</p><p>Surgical outcomes are similar for traditional laparoscopy and robot-assisted laparoscopy when used for hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-route-of-hysterectomy-for-benign-disease/abstract/7,10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10-14</a>]. In a 2016 meta-analysis of four trials (three randomized controlled trials and one prospective controlled trial) including 326 women comparing robot-assisted and conventional laparoscopic total hysterectomy, the two approaches had similar complication rates (overall and rates stratified by severity), length of hospital stay, total operating time, conversions to laparotomy, and blood loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-route-of-hysterectomy-for-benign-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>A major concern of robot-assisted hysterectomy is the cost, particularly if there is no difference in surgical outcome compared with traditional laparoscopy. In addition to the cost of the system, the surgical instruments that attach to the robotic arms must be replaced after every 10 uses. One challenge to assessing cost-effectiveness is that cost can be calculated as the cost of all the equipment (including the purchase of the robot system) or as the cost of equipment used per case (ie, assume the robot system is a pre-existing investment). In general, robot-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy is more costly than conventional laparoscopic technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-route-of-hysterectomy-for-benign-disease/abstract/10-12,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12,16,17</a>].

When vaginal access is adequate and the uterus is enlarged, vaginal hysterectomy is accomplished using uterine size reduction techniques such as wedge morcellation, uterine bisection, and intra-myometrial coring. A randomized trial comparing vaginal and abdominal hysterectomy for 119 women with enlarged uteri (200 to 1300 g) demonstrated decreased operating time, febrile morbidity, postoperative narcotic use, and hospital stay for the vaginal hysterectomy group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-route-of-hysterectomy-for-benign-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>We believe uterine shape is often more important than actual size in considering choice of hysterectomy route. Before beginning any morcellation procedure, the uterine vessels are ligated bilaterally, and the peritoneal cavity is entered both anteriorly and posteriorly. If the cervix or lower uterine segment is enlarged or contains fibroids that prevent uterine artery ligation or entry into the peritoneal cavity, then the procedure is not performed vaginally. In contrast, if the lower uterine segment is accessible surgically, then even very large uteri (up to 20-week size) can be removed transvaginally by an appropriately skilled surgeon.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H801890474\"><span class=\"h2\">Accessibility of the uterus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While a narrow pubic arch (less than 90 degrees), a narrow vagina, an undescended immobile uterus, and nulliparity have been traditionally proposed as contraindications for vaginal hysterectomy, if the vaginal aperture is adequate to allow division of the uterosacral and cardinal ligaments, uterine mobility is often adequate to allow completion of vaginal hysterectomy, even if there is minimal uterine descent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-route-of-hysterectomy-for-benign-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

However, a much larger registry-based cohort study from Denmark (n = 7685 women) reported the peri- and postoperative complications at hysterectomy were more frequent in women with previous cesarean deliveries, with adjusted odds ratios of 1.16 (95% CI 0.98-1.37) for one cesarean delivery and 1.30 (95% CI 1.02-1.65) for two or more cesarean deliveries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-route-of-hysterectomy-for-benign-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Administration of blood transfusion was almost twice as frequent after two or more cesarean deliveries. Infection following the previous cesarean was an unfavorable prognostic factor due to an increased risk of dense adhesions between the bladder and cervix [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-route-of-hysterectomy-for-benign-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H801890492\"><span class=\"h2\">Nulliparity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nulliparity is not a contraindication to vaginal hysterectomy.

Potential study confounders include the presence of baseline urinary symptoms and other pelvic floor disorders, different study methodologies, multiple indications for the hysterectomy, different surgical techniques, and varied length of follow-up.</p><p>As an example, two large retrospective cohort studies (including over 600,000 and 93,000 women, respectively) reported hysterectomy was associated with increased risk of subsequent surgery for stress incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-route-of-hysterectomy-for-benign-disease/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>] and increased incidence of both urge urinary incontinence and stress urinary incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-route-of-hysterectomy-for-benign-disease/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>], compared with women who had not undergone hysterectomy. However, a different retrospective cohort study of over 16,000 women undergoing hysterectomy who were followed for one year reported obesity (body mass index &ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>),</span> prior vaginal delivery, and pre-operative daily urge without incontinence were associated with increased risk of de-novo posthysterectomy urinary incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-route-of-hysterectomy-for-benign-disease/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. Further, body mass index &lt;25 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> prolapse, fibroids, or lack of daily urge without incontinence were associated with remission of urinary incontinence symptoms. Lastly, a small longitudinal cohort study that followed 661 women for 10 years reported no difference in incidence proportions of stress and urgency incontinence among women who underwent hysterectomy and women in the control groups (laparoscopic cholecystectomy and transcervical endometrial resection) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-route-of-hysterectomy-for-benign-disease/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. In all groups, the prevalence of stress and urgency urinary incontinence increased with time, and women in all three groups changed their status from continent to incontinent and vice versa. While this study group was much smaller than the others, the study provides 10-year prospective data.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H244676999\"><span class=\"h2\">Pelvic organ prolapse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies have reported mixed results on the role of hysterectomy in the development of prolapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-route-of-hysterectomy-for-benign-disease/abstract/95-101\" class=\"abstract_t\">95-101</a>]. This discordancy likely reflects differences in patient populations (ie, proportion of patients with pre-existing prolapse, age, menopausal status), surgical technique (ie, type of cuff closure and incorporation of support ligaments), lack of standardized outcome criteria, and length of follow-up. In general, the risk of future prolapse appears to be highest when hysterectomy is performed in women with existing prolapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-route-of-hysterectomy-for-benign-disease/abstract/102-106\" class=\"abstract_t\">102-106</a>], while the risk in women with normal pelvic support is less clear.

A case-control study of over 180,000 women reported a four times higher rate of subsequent surgery to repair a pelvic organ fistula in the hysterectomized women than in the control group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-route-of-hysterectomy-for-benign-disease/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>]. This differs from resource-limited countries, in which pelvic organ fistulas are most commonly related to obstetric injury.

(See <a href=\"#H801890461\" class=\"local\">'Factors that influence the route of hysterectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend a vaginal approach to hysterectomy for most patients (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Compared with other routes of hysterectomy, it is less invasive, more cosmetic, and associated with fewer complications, shorter hospital stay, lower cost, and faster return to normal activity. (See <a href=\"#H801890408\" class=\"local\">'Selecting the route of hysterectomy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H801890431\" class=\"local\">'Vaginal hysterectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women who have adnexal pathology, extrauterine disease, advanced endometriosis, or who desire definitive oophorectomy may require laparoscopic assistance at hysterectomy to complete the surgery. (See <a href=\"#H801890480\" class=\"local\">'Extrauterine pathology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H801890529\" class=\"local\">'Prophylactic oophorectomy or salpingectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest total laparoscopic hysterectomy or laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy in patients in whom laparoscopic visualization of the pelvis and laparoscopic surgery are needed to assess pelvic findings or to allow performance of vaginal hysterectomy. (See <a href=\"#H801890408\" class=\"local\">'Selecting the route of hysterectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest performing total hysterectomy rather than supracervical hysterectomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). There are no proven medical or surgical benefits of performing supracervical (subtotal) hysterectomy if the cervix can be easily removed with the corpus. However, some women may choose this option after appropriate counseling of its benefits and risks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Women who have had a supracervical hysterectomy need to be screened for cervical cancer according to standard guidelines for their age and risk status. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-cervical-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for cervical cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If vaginal hysterectomy is contraindicated or not technically possible, we suggest conventional laparoscopic hysterectomy rather than abdominal hysterectomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Robot-assisted laparoscopy and single-port laparoscopy do not have improved outcomes compared with conventional laparoscopy but may be considered in select cases. (See <a href=\"#H13021426\" class=\"local\">'Laparoscopic hysterectomy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H801890443\" class=\"local\">'Robot-assisted hysterectomy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13021247\" class=\"local\">'Single-port laparoscopy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cost-analysis trials consistently demonstrate that vaginal hysterectomy is the most cost-effective route and robot-assisted surgery is the least cost effective. Laparoscopic hysterectomy can be cost-effective relative to abdominal hysterectomy but is more dependent on determinants such as length of hospital stay, operating room time, and use of disposable surgical devices. (See <a href=\"#H801890535\" class=\"local\">'Cost considerations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of women who undergo hysterectomy report improvement in gynecologic symptoms, improvement in sexual function, and overall high satisfaction. These findings are found equally with all routes of hysterectomy. Hysterectomy does appear to contribute to earlier menopause. (See <a href=\"#H244676280\" class=\"local\">'Non-surgical outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to routine surgical complications, hysterectomy may contribute to the development of urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The risk of subsequent prolapse is greatest for women who have underlying prolapse as the indication for the hysterectomy. The risk of future prolapse for women with normal anatomic support at the time of their hysterectomy is unknown, although it does appear that providing additional support to the vaginal cuff after hysterectomy helps to prevent the future development of pelvic organ prolapse. (See <a href=\"#H244676811\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choosing-a-route-of-hysterectomy-for-benign-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Garry R, Fountain J, Mason S, et al.
