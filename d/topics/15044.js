Almost all children are infected by two years of age, and reinfection is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The clinical manifestations vary with age, health status, and whether the infection is primary or secondary.</p><p>The treatment of respiratory syncytial virus infection in infants, children, and adults will be discussed here. The epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and prevention of RSV infection are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory syncytial virus infection: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory syncytial virus infection: Prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The discussion that follows assumes that the patient's illness is severe enough to require hospital admission or to pursue an etiologic diagnosis since specific etiologic diagnosis is usually not sought in otherwise healthy patients with mild respiratory tract infections who are treated symptomatically as outpatients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory syncytial virus infection: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Indications for hospitalization in children with bronchiolitis are discussed separately.

Inhaled bronchodilators are not routinely recommended for infants and young children with bronchiolitis, but a one-time trial may be warranted for those with severe disease (eg, nasal flaring; retractions; grunting; respiratory rate &gt;70 breaths per minute; dyspnea; or cyanosis).

More aggressive therapy, including immunotherapy, or antiviral and immunotherapy with or without corticosteroids may be warranted for immunocompromised patients, as described below.

The supportive care and inpatient treatment for bronchiolitis and pneumonia are discussed in detail separately. Important aspects of care and those specific to children with RSV will be summarized below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-in-children-inpatient-treatment#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pneumonia in children: Inpatient treatment&quot;, section on 'Supportive care'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchiolitis-in-infants-and-children-treatment-outcome-and-prevention#H91755868\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bronchiolitis in infants and children: Treatment, outcome, and prevention&quot;, section on 'Severe bronchiolitis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Respiratory support</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants with RSV bronchiolitis and pneumonia frequently have arterial oxygen saturations of &le;90 percent.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=continuous-oxygen-delivery-systems-for-infants-children-and-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Continuous oxygen delivery systems for infants, children, and adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Mechanical ventilation may be required in patients with severe respiratory symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> apnea due to RSV. The frequency of mechanical ventilation varies according to age and underlying health status from approximately 5 percent in infants hospitalized with RSV to up to 50 percent of adults with leukemia and myelosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-treatment/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOTHERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Bronchodilators</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We do not routinely suggest inhaled bronchodilators for children with RSV bronchiolitis. Meta-analyses of randomized trials and systematic reviews suggest that bronchodilators may provide modest short-term clinical improvement but do not affect overall outcome, may have adverse effects, and increase the cost of care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-treatment/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>].

In older children and adults, corticosteroids may be beneficial in the management of RSV-associated bronchial reactivity, particularly in those with asthma, in whom RSV reinfection may have triggered an exacerbation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-emergency-department-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute asthma exacerbations in children: Emergency department management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Corticosteroids have the potential to decrease bronchiolar swelling and airway obstruction through their anti-inflammatory effects. However, in randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-treatment/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>], meta-analyses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], and systematic reviews [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-treatment/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>], they have not been shown to be beneficial for the treatment of bronchiolitis.

In addition, ribavirin is expensive and must be given early in the course to be effective, and there are concerns regarding occupational exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Some studies have demonstrated decreased severity of illness; decreased duration of mechanical ventilation, oxygen therapy, and hospital stay; and decreased viral shedding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-treatment/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>], whereas other studies have not demonstrated these benefits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-treatment/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. A 2004 systematic review of randomized trials comparing ribavirin with placebo in infants and children with RSV infection and LRTI found that trials of ribavirin lack sufficient power to provide reliable estimates of the effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends against the routine use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-treatment/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Early use of inhaled ribavirin has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in adult hematopoietic cell transplant recipients who develop RSV infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-treatment/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].
