Infection directly involving structures of the upper airway, such as the epiglottis, larynx, or subglottic trachea, can cause sudden, life-threatening symptoms.</p><p>The most common infections that may impinge on the airway include:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Croup</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Croup, also known as laryngitis, laryngotracheitis, and laryngotracheobronchitis, is the most common infectious cause of upper airway obstruction in children 6 to 36 months of age. Spasmodic croup causes symptoms that are the same as those of laryngotracheitis, but without signs of infection. There may be an allergic component to spasmodic croup.</p><p>Croup cause inflammation of the subglottic trachea that results in cough, hoarseness, stridor, and respiratory distress. The severity of the distress depends upon the degree of obstruction. The diagnosis usually can be made based upon a characteristic &quot;barking&quot; cough with hoarseness. If performed, radiographs have characteristic findings of subglottic haziness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64727\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64727 \">image 1</a>), a narrowing of the superior trachea (&quot;steeple sign&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52418\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52418 \">image 2</a>)), and a normal epiglottitis.

Children are generally older than those with croup, have more severe symptoms, and are highly febrile. Radiographs may show an intraluminal tracheal membrane or tracheal wall irregularity (scalloping) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80331\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80331 \">image 3</a>).

Prominent presenting complaints are usually fever, neck pain, neck stiffness, and sore throat rather than acute, severe airway obstruction. A lateral radiograph can help differentiate retropharyngeal abscess from other infectious causes of upper airway obstruction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63233\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63233 \">image 4</a>). However, computed tomography (CT) of the neck with intravenous contrast is required to definitively make the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retropharyngeal-infections-in-children#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retropharyngeal infections in children&quot;, section on 'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Rarely, a retropharyngeal abscess may extrinsically compress structures in the upper airway. These patients require definitive airway management before diagnostic imaging. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Peritonsillar abscess</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Peritonsillar abscess (PTA) is a collection of pus located between the capsule of the palatine tonsil and the pharyngeal muscles. It generally occurs in later childhood and adolescence. </p><p>The typical clinical presentation of PTA is a severe sore throat (usually unilateral), fever, and a &quot;hot potato&quot; or muffled voice. Pooling of saliva or drooling may be present. Trismus, related to irritation and reflex spasm of the internal pterygoid muscle, occurs in nearly two-thirds of patients; the sudden onset of severe respiratory distress or significant airway obstruction is rare. </p><p>The diagnosis of PTA can usually be made clinically without laboratory data or imaging of any kind in the patient with medial displacement of the tonsil and deviation of the uvula (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F69943\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69943 \">picture 1</a>).

IM often begins with malaise, headache, and low-grade fever before development of the more specific signs of tonsillitis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pharyngitis, cervical lymph node enlargement and tenderness, and moderate to high fever. Affected patients usually have peripheral blood lymphocytosis, composed in large measure of atypical lymphocytes. </p><p>The lymphadenopathy characteristically is symmetric and involves the posterior cervical chain more than the anterior chain. Tonsillar exudate is a frequent component of the pharyngitis; the exudate can have a white, gray-green, or necrotic appearance. Obstruction of the upper airway due to massive tonsillar enlargement and mucosal edema is an uncommon but potentially fatal complication of infectious mononucleosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-evaluation-of-acute-upper-airway-obstruction-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Common symptoms of upper airway compromise include acute respiratory distress with the child preferring an upright posture with the head in a sniffing position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76538\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76538 \">picture 2</a>), dysphagia, muffled voice, and difficulty handling oral secretions. In children, risk factors include incomplete or lack of immunization to <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, type b or immune deficiency.

In a retrospective report, the majority of prehospital calls for airway obstruction in children less than 5 years of age were caused by a foreign object [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-evaluation-of-acute-upper-airway-obstruction-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Symptoms resolved in more than half of children prior to the arrival of paramedics. An intervention was required in 2 percent of cases.</p><p>Clinical manifestations vary by the location of the FB: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Airway FB</strong> &ndash; Most aspirated objects lodge in the bronchi and are not immediately life-threatening. Although rare, FBs in the larynx or trachea can cause significant complete or partial airway obstruction that requires immediate treatment. These patients may have a history of choking and present with signs of severe airway obstruction (marked suprasternal retractions, stridor, and anxious appearance) typically without fever. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=airway-foreign-bodies-in-children#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Airway foreign bodies in children&quot;, section on 'Signs and symptoms'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If a child presents with <strong>complete</strong> airway obstruction (ie, is unable to speak or cough), dislodgement using back blows and chest compressions in infants, and the Heimlich maneuver in older children, should be attempted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55990\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef55990 \">algorithm 3</a>). By contrast, these interventions should be <strong>avoided</strong> in children who are able to speak or cough since they may convert a partial to a complete obstruction. For the same reason &quot;blind&quot; sweeping of the mouth and oropharynx should <strong>not</strong> be performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=airway-foreign-bodies-in-children#H127539331\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Airway foreign bodies in children&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with suspected FB aspiration who are symptomatic but stable, the first step in the evaluation is to perform plain radiography of the chest (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F105656\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef105656 \">algorithm 4</a>). Ideally, both inspiratory and expiratory radiographs (eg. lateral decubitus films) should be obtained, if this is possible, because this may increase the sensitivity for detecting a radiolucent FB. Subsequent steps depend on the degree of clinical suspicion for FBs, and may include CT or bronchoscopy. Normal radiographic studies do not exclude the presence of an aspirated FB. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=airway-foreign-bodies-in-children#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Airway foreign bodies in children&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=airway-foreign-bodies-in-children#H127539331\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Airway foreign bodies in children&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Esophageal FB</strong> &ndash; FBs lodged in the esophagus in the area of the cricoid cartilage or the tracheal bifurcation can compress the airway causing partial airway obstruction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52252\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52252 \">figure 1</a>). It is also possible that an esophageal FB will become dislodged into the upper airway. Eliciting a history of choking in a child with characteristic findings of dysphagia, drooling, and respiratory distress are the keystones in diagnosing an esophageal FB and to the prevention of its complications. Imaging can be used to confirm the findings and to localize the site of the FB (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76887\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76887 \">image 5</a>). The diagnostic steps and treatment depend on the patient's symptoms, the shape and location of the FB, whether it is radio-opaque, or whether it has magnetic properties (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57363\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef57363 \">algorithm 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F83942\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef83942 \">algorithm 6</a>).
