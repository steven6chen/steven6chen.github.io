However, it can induce anaphylaxis on rare occasions. This topic reviews the frequency, risk factors, and appropriate strategies for management and prevention of anaphylaxis due to SCIT, as well as the clinical features of fatal and near-fatal allergic reactions, and systemic reactions (SRs) to allergen injections.</p><p>The indications for SCIT, the treatment of anaphylaxis, and fatal anaphylaxis due to many different causes are discussed separately. SRs to sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) are also reviewed separately.

As early as 1916, systemic reactions (SRs) were reported to occur with 3.5 percent of subcutaneous grass pollen injections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-induced-by-subcutaneous-allergen-immunotherapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In 1986, the Committee on the Safety of Medicines in the United Kingdom reported 26 SCIT-related anaphylactic deaths over a 10-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-induced-by-subcutaneous-allergen-immunotherapy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This report led to adoption of a mandatory two-hour postinjection waiting period in the United Kingdom. This was difficult to implement and essentially eliminated the use of this therapy for years until a one-hour standard observation period was accepted. A 30-minute postinjection observation period is recommended in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-induced-by-subcutaneous-allergen-immunotherapy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic allergic reactions to SCIT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic reactions (SRs) to subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy (SCIT) range from cutaneous manifestations (pruritus, urticaria, or angioedema at locations other than the site of the injection) to anaphylaxis. The World Allergy Organization has issued a new grading system for classifying clinical severity of SRs to SCIT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F85944\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85944 \">table 1</a>). The risk of experiencing SRs may vary according to types of allergens, potency of the injected allergens, modes of allergen preparation and modification, and dosing protocols (eg, cluster or rush regimens are associated with higher frequencies of SRs than slow build-up regimens) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-induced-by-subcutaneous-allergen-immunotherapy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SRs of varying severity occurred with approximately 0.1 percent of all injections and in 5 percent of treated patients in two SCIT studies with alum-adsorbed extracts with a limited number of allergens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-induced-by-subcutaneous-allergen-immunotherapy/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A SR rate of 0.025 to 0.4 percent of injections and in 7 percent of treated patients was reported in two studies of SCIT with aqueous unmodified allergens using conventional build-up regimens with multiple allergens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-induced-by-subcutaneous-allergen-immunotherapy/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].

Patients who received only alum-absorbed extracts had lower frequency and severity of SRs.

Three retrospective surveys of fatal reactions (FRs) and one survey of near-fatal reactions (NFRs) were conducted to assess frequency and nature of life-threatening anaphylaxis related to SCIT as practiced in North America [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-induced-by-subcutaneous-allergen-immunotherapy/abstract/12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-16</a>]. Members of the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI) were contacted about occurrence of FRs in their practices and indirect knowledge of such events occurring in other community practices. Responders reporting anaphylactic events were requested to complete a questionnaire regarding clinical manifestations of FRs and NFRs, contributing factors, and subsequent management of anaphylactic reactions.</p><p>Questionnaire responders reported 76 FRs to SCIT occurring between 1973 and 2001 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-induced-by-subcutaneous-allergen-immunotherapy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. FRs were estimated to occur once in every 2 million injections from 1985 to 1989 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-induced-by-subcutaneous-allergen-immunotherapy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] and once in every 2.5 million injections from 1990 to 2001 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-induced-by-subcutaneous-allergen-immunotherapy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. On average, FRs occurred in 2 percent of allergy practices participating in the second survey, with a mean of three FRs occurring annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-induced-by-subcutaneous-allergen-immunotherapy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In the same survey, NFRs (defined as respiratory compromise, hypotension, or both, requiring emergency <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> treatment) were reported at a rate of five events per year or one in every 1 million injections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-induced-by-subcutaneous-allergen-immunotherapy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. These data may underestimate or overestimate true incidences because of a low responder rate (approximately 25 percent) as well as potential inaccuracies in recall reporting and lack of verification of events occurring in other community practices.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Web-based surveillance for anaphylaxis to SCIT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An annual surveillance project (North American SCIT Fatality and Systemic Reaction Surveillance Project), cosponsored by the AAAAI and ACAAI, was initiated in 2008.

The survey captures data to estimate annual FRs, mean and median numbers of SCIT injections administered, as well as frequencies of mild (Grade 1), moderate (Grade 2), and severe (Grade 3) nonfatal SRs. Participants were asked if there were any FRs due to SCIT or skin testing in their practice, and also if they had heard of any in the surrounding communities.

However, two large studies including over 600,000 injections did not find a correlation between pollen counts and SRs, although there was a correlation in one study with mean monthly mold counts from August to October [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-induced-by-subcutaneous-allergen-immunotherapy/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. Thus, there are several areas of uncertainty regarding best practices for managing pollen-allergic patients receiving SCIT during peak seasons.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some allergy experts empirically reduce maintenance doses during peak pollen seasons. In the surveillance study mentioned previously, practices that always reduced maintenance doses during peak pollen seasons were significantly less likely to experience moderate (Grade 2) or severe (Grade 3) SRs than those practices who often, sometimes, or never adjusted doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-induced-by-subcutaneous-allergen-immunotherapy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, this could also reflect other preventive measures taken by those practices.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">At present, published data on the issue of dose adjustments for peak pollen seasons are limited and clinicians differ in their approach. Several variables may be involved. In parts of the world where pollen exposure occurs year round, it may not be necessary to reduce the dose of the related aeroallergen during peak season, whereas this may be important in areas with predictable peak pollen seasons. In addition, the individual patient's sensitivity to pollen, and whether or not they have concomitant asthma or past history of anaphylaxis to immunotherapy should be considered. It is the author&rsquo;s practice to make adjustments to SCIT in response to peak pollen seasons on an individual basis. When doses are reduced, a typical adjustment for a patient on maintenance would be 0.3 to 0.15 mL, which is then increased again when the pollen season is ending.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who are in the build-up phase of SCIT, most clinicians increase doses of pollen SCIT normally during peak pollen season. Again, studies specifically addressing the safety of this practice are lacking and clinicians should use clinical judgement if a patient is highly pollen allergic and experiencing significant symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1318612468\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Rates of SRs range from 0.1 to 4 percent of injections. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Incidence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fatal and near-fatal reactions (FRs and NFRs) to SCIT are rare. FRs are estimated to occur once in every 2.5 million injections and NFRs once in every 1 million injections. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Incidence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most serious reactions begin within 30 minutes after administration of injections. Hypotension, upper airway obstruction, and bronchospasm are common in both NFRs and FRs. Cutaneous manifestations (urticaria, angioedema, and pruritus) may be absent in FRs, and their absence potentially delays recognition of a reaction. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Characteristics of life-threatening reactions to SCIT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Possible contributing factors for FRs include uncontrolled asthma, history of previous SRs, delayed treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>, <span class=\"nowrap\">dosing/injection</span> errors, and administration of pollen SCIT during the peak pollen season. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Factors associated with fatal and near-fatal anaphylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The contribution of concurrent beta-adrenergic blocker treatment to fatal outcomes is uncertain. Beta-blocker therapy is relatively contraindicated but may be necessary in patients with cardiovascular disease who also have insect-sting anaphylactic reactions. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been associated with more severe SRs in patients receiving venom immunotherapy (VIT). (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Beta-adrenergic blockers'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4234713\" class=\"local\">'ACE inhibitors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Timely detection of anaphylaxis and prompt injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> are critical to good outcomes.
