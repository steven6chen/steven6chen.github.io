Establishing the diagnosis is often difficult because few of the symptoms or signs are pathognomonic of the syndrome in isolation. There is a large spectrum of manifestations from subclinical to overt syndrome, depending on duration and intensity of excess steroid production. Furthermore, some of them (such as obesity, hypertension, and glucose intolerance) are common in individuals who do not have adrenal hyperfunction. An important clinical clue to the presence of glucocorticoid excess is the <strong>simultaneous development and increasing severity</strong> of several of these symptoms.</p><p>The major manifestations of Cushing's syndrome will be reviewed here. The diagnosis and treatment of this disorder and Cushing's syndrome during pregnancy are discussed separately.

Therefore, iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome must be more common than any other cause but is seldom reported. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;, section on 'Dermatologic effects and appearance'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cushing's disease </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Pituitary ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome is five to six times more common than Cushing's syndrome caused by benign and malignant adrenal tumors combined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Thus, the incidence of Cushing's disease may be 5 to 25 per million per year. However, the reported incidence was much lower (1.2 to 2.4 per million per year) in one population-based study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. In a United States study, the incidence was higher than previously reported in European studies as it was found to affect 6.2 to 7.6 per million person-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Approximately 1 percent of patients with small-cell lung cancer have the ectopic ACTH syndrome, but this is more common when assessed biochemically; small-cell lung carcinoma causes half of all cases of the syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The incidence of small-cell lung carcinoma has decreased, but there are still approximately 30,000 new cases annually in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Therefore, one could expect approximately 300 new cases of ectopic ACTH syndrome per year in the United States. Other causes of ectopic ACTH syndrome, such as bronchopulmonary carcinoids, are reviewed separately.

The menstrual abnormalities correlated with increased serum cortisol and decreased serum estradiol concentrations but not with serum androgen concentrations. Because both luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels are low, the menstrual irregularities appear to be due to suppression of secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone by hypercortisolemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2129279981\"><span class=\"h3\">Signs of adrenal androgen excess</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with some types of Cushing's syndrome have signs of androgen excess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>] (most commonly adrenal carcinoma).

Thus, men with Cushing's syndrome do not have signs of androgen excess, because cortisol has no androgenic activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Signs of androgen excess in Cushing's syndrome are most common in women with adrenal carcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/10,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,17</a>]. These tumors usually secrete large amounts of androgenic precursors because they are inefficient at converting cholesterol to cortisol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. In comparison, signs of androgen excess are usually mild in women with ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome and do not occur in women with adrenal adenomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Androgen excess in affected women can cause the following symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hirsutism, which is usually mild and limited to the face but can be generalized.

Unlike most other symptoms and signs associated with Cushing's syndrome, which can occur alone or in combination in normal subjects and patients with pseudo-Cushing's states, the dermatologic changes characteristic of Cushing's syndrome seldom occur in other subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/22,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,34</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Easy bruisability</strong> &ndash; Loss of subcutaneous connective tissue due to the catabolic effects of glucocorticoid results in easy bruising after minimal, often unremembered, injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F65564\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65564 \">picture 3</a>). Extensive ecchymoses at venipuncture sites are also common, and it is often difficult to maintain intravenous lines without fluid infiltration into the surrounding tissues. As a result, patients with Cushing's syndrome are sometimes thought to have senile purpura or a bleeding diathesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Striae</strong> &ndash; Purple striae occur as the fragile skin stretches due to the enlarging trunk, breasts, and abdomen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F67682\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67682 \">picture 4</a>). The striae appear as wide, reddish-purple streaks because the increasingly thin skin does not hide the color of venous blood in the underlying dermis. Striae occur most often in younger patients, can be numerous, and are most common on the abdomen and lower flanks; however, they can also occur on the breasts, hips, buttocks, shoulders, upper thighs, upper arms, and axillae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Skin atrophy</strong> &ndash; The skin usually atrophies, the stratum corneum is thinned, and there is loss of subcutaneous fat to a sufficient degree that subcutaneous blood vessels may be seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The skin eventually becomes fragile due to these changes and, in extreme cases, peels off after being covered with adhesive tape. Minor wounds heal slowly, and surgical wounds may dehisce. Such changes should be considered in the context of gender and age differences in skin thickness, with healthy men and younger individuals having greater skin thickness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fungal infections</strong> &ndash; Cutaneous fungal infections, especially tinea versicolor, are often found on the trunk. Some patients have fungal infections of the nails, but oral candidiasis is rare.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hyperpigmentation</strong> &ndash; Hyperpigmentation is induced by increased ACTH, not cortisol, secretion. ACTH is the principal pigmentary hormone in humans. It acts via binding to melanocyte-stimulating hormone receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The degree of hyperpigmentation is dependent upon both the duration and the degree of increase in ACTH secretion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Hyperpigmentation occurs most often in patients with the ectopic ACTH syndrome, less often in those with pituitary overproduction of ACTH, and not at all in patients with adrenal tumors in whom ACTH secretion is suppressed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Hyperpigmentation may be generalized but is most conspicuous in areas exposed to light (such as the face, neck, and back of the hands) or to chronic mild trauma, friction, or pressure (such as the elbows, knees, spine, knuckles, waist [belt], midriff [girdle], and shoulders [brassiere straps]) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F70693%7EENDO%2F61260\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70693 graphicRef61260 \">picture 5A-B</a>).
