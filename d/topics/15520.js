There will be an emphasis on secondary prevention of recurrent cerebral ischemia and other vascular events. Risk factor management, which is appropriate for all patients with ischemic stroke or TIA, is reviewed in detail elsewhere.

The role of anticoagulation in this setting is quite limited, as noted below. Patients with large artery atherothrombotic disease in anterior and posterior cerebral circulation sites other than the internal carotid artery and patients with the latter lesions who cannot undergo carotid endarterectomy benefit from antiplatelet therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antiplatelet-therapy-for-secondary-prevention-of-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention of stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some specific situations are discussed below for carotid disease, vertebral disease, intracranial disease, and dissection (a nonatheromatous cause).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Carotid stenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Carotid endarterectomy is beneficial for patients with recently symptomatic internal carotid artery atherosclerotic disease. This conclusion is based upon a number of randomized, controlled trials that have demonstrated the efficacy of endarterectomy in selected patients who have carotid atherosclerosis and symptoms such as a TIA or a nondisabling stroke. This issue is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-symptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of symptomatic carotid atherosclerotic disease&quot;, section on 'Carotid endarterectomy'</a>.)</p><p>Carotid artery stenting is another potential option for select patients with symptomatic occlusive carotid lesions. Proponents of carotid stenting emphasize its less invasive nature (since it can be performed with local anesthesia and sedation) and the decreased likelihood of morbidity from coexisting coronary disease. Another group that may benefit from stenting consists of those with a &quot;hostile&quot; neck who are at higher risk for complications following standard carotid endarterectomy; included in this group are patients with radiation-induced stenosis, previous neck exploration, or tracheostomy. Nevertheless, carotid endarterectomy remains the preferred treatment for most patients with symptomatic carotid atherosclerosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-symptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of symptomatic carotid atherosclerotic disease&quot;, section on 'Carotid stenting'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carotid-artery-stenting-and-its-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carotid artery stenting and its complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Carotid occlusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Carotid artery occlusion may occur without clear symptoms, but it can be associated with TIA and stroke. The subsequent yearly risk of a stroke ipsilateral to the occluded carotid artery is 2 to 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-prevention-for-specific-causes-of-ischemic-stroke-and-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The optimal treatment of carotid occlusion remains undefined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-prevention-for-specific-causes-of-ischemic-stroke-and-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, surgical revascularization is a viable option only when residual flow can be demonstrated in the internal carotid artery. In most cases, medical management is the only practical option in the setting of complete carotid occlusion. Many experts use short-term (three to six months) anticoagulation for acute symptomatic occlusion; the rationale for this approach is based on evidence that emboli may form and propagate from the stump of the occluded artery after acute occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-prevention-for-specific-causes-of-ischemic-stroke-and-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. An earlier randomized, controlled trial in patients with symptomatic carotid narrowing or occlusion found that surgical treatment using extracranial to intracranial bypass failed to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-prevention-for-specific-causes-of-ischemic-stroke-and-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], and the later Carotid Occlusion Surgery Study (COSS) trial in patients with symptomatic carotid occlusion and hemodynamic cerebral ischemia also found no benefit for extracranial to intracranial bypass surgery compared with medical therapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-prevention-for-specific-causes-of-ischemic-stroke-and-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Data from small retrospective studies suggest that recanalization can be achieved by emergent stenting of extracranial carotid artery occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-prevention-for-specific-causes-of-ischemic-stroke-and-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], or by intraarterial thrombolysis combined with stenting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-prevention-for-specific-causes-of-ischemic-stroke-and-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], but clinical benefit is uncertain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Extracranial vertebral artery stenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, prevention of ischemic stroke and TIA due to extracranial vertebral artery stenosis is managed by intensive medical treatment and multifactorial risk reduction, including the use of antiplatelet agents, antihypertensive drugs, and statins. In addition, angioplasty and stenting is a treatment option [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-prevention-for-specific-causes-of-ischemic-stroke-and-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>], and surgical transposition of the vertebral artery to the common carotid artery is another alternative for vertebral origin stenosis. However, efficacy for these procedures is uncertain. They are generally considered when maximal medical therapy has failed to prevent embolism or low-flow ischemic events.</p><p>Guidelines for the prevention of stroke from the American Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/American</span> Stroke Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(AHA/ASA)</span> issued in 2014 reach a similar conclusion, stating that endovascular and surgical treatment of symptomatic extracranial vertebral stenosis may be considered when patients are having symptoms despite optimal medical therapies (eg, antithrombotic agents, statins, and other risk factor treatment) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-prevention-for-specific-causes-of-ischemic-stroke-and-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Intracranial large artery atherosclerosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of intracranial large artery atherosclerosis is reviewed here briefly and discussed in detail separately.

The best treatment for intracranial large artery occlusive disease is unclear.</p><p>Randomized clinical trials, such as Warfarin-Aspirin Recurrent Stroke Study (WARSS) and Warfarin-Aspirin Symptomatic Intracranial Disease (WASID), have found no difference in terms of benefit between antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy for ischemic stroke risk reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-prevention-for-specific-causes-of-ischemic-stroke-and-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].

Approximately 60 percent of all strokes in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) stroke databank are caused by embolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-prevention-for-specific-causes-of-ischemic-stroke-and-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], and cardiogenic embolism is responsible for 14 to 30 percent of ischemic strokes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-prevention-for-specific-causes-of-ischemic-stroke-and-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The distinction between artery-to-artery and non-artery-to-artery sources of embolism can be difficult. Suspicion of the former typically arises once vascular pathology in a large artery has been identified (eg, with noninvasive testing). Repetitive spells within a single vascular territory are also suggestive of an artery-to-artery source, as is a normal echocardiogram. However, caution must be used in interpreting the results of a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). This study can exclude a cardiomyopathy and most atrial and mitral valve pathology, but may miss other potential embolic sources such as a patent foramen ovale, clot in the atrial appendage, mitral valve lesions, and aortic atherosclerosis. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is better for identifying these lesions.</p><p>We recommend doing a TTE with agitated saline contrast as a first test, and proceeding to TEE if there is a strong suspicion of a cardioembolic source and treatment decisions hinge on identifying one of the possible TEE findings.
