Patients who are likely to have stage 4 or stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) early after nonrenal organ transplant or those with established primary renal disease that is likely to progress rapidly (thereby requiring chronic kidney replacement therapy shortly after transplant) should be listed for combined organ transplant. In an era of ever-increasing organ shortage and longer waiting times for kidneys, combined nonrenal and renal organ transplantation should be considered very judiciously. In 2016, the United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS) approved a new policy that formalized the allocation of simultaneous liver-kidney (SLK) transplants, anticipated to go into effect in 2017 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-function-and-nonrenal-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Approach in liver transplant candidates'</a> below.)</p><p>The vast majority of patients with normal or mild impairment in kidney function should receive a nonrenal solid organ transplant alone. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3665722177\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial evaluation of renal function in nonrenal solid organ transplant candidates typically includes the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-function-and-nonrenal-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment of prior kidney function</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measurement of current kidney function</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinalysis with microscopy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinary electrolytes and osmolality</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>24-hour urine collection for protein and creatinine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging studies of the kidneys</p><p/><p>Based upon findings from this initial evaluation, a kidney biopsy may be required.

We determine the baseline serum creatinine concentration and the presence or absence of proteinuria in the three to six months prior to the current evaluation. Acute kidney injury (AKI) may be primarily due to deterioration in underlying heart, lung, or liver disease and is frequently compromised by poor effective circulating volume (eg, low cardiac output in advanced heart failure or hepatorenal syndrome in liver failure). In these situations, kidney function may improve after replacement of the nonrenal failing organ.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3602207761\"><span class=\"h3\">Measurement of current kidney function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We routinely evaluate current kidney function through the use of the four-variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula to estimate GFR. However, an alternative option is measurement of 24 hour urine creatinine clearance. </p><p>In general, methods of estimating GFR through the use of creatinine-based formulas lack precision, but they may provide a better assessment than serum creatinine alone in this patient population. The serum creatinine level may overestimate GFR, especially in patients with advanced liver disease or advanced heart failure, who frequently have poor nutritional status, low muscle mass, weight loss, and edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-function-and-nonrenal-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Since the pretransplant level of kidney function is one of the main predictors of kidney function following nonrenal solid organ transplantation, failure to accurately estimate GFR by the use of serum creatinine alone may result in unrealistic expectations of what kidney function will be after the transplant. More accurate methods of estimating GFR that rely on the renal clearance of various radionuclide markers (eg, 125I-labeled iothalamate) are limited by availability, cost, and radiation exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-function-and-nonrenal-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-kidney-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of kidney function&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Limitations of the methods available to estimate GFR among transplant candidates are illustrated by the following studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-function-and-nonrenal-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/8,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11,12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a large study of 1447 liver transplant candidates, serum creatinine-based GFR estimation equations (MDRD, Cockroft-Gault, and Nankivell formulas) were compared with 125I-labeled iothalamate GFR measurements performed before and after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-function-and-nonrenal-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The mean pretransplant creatinine was 1.15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> and the mean iothalamate GFR was 91 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>. Of the formulas, the MDRD estimates correlated best with GFR, although only 66 percent of estimates were within 30 percent of the measured GFR. When patients were divided into two groups according to GFR greater or less than 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min,</span> all the formulas overestimated GFR in the patients with poor function (GFR &lt;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min),</span> while the formulas underestimated GFR in patients with better function (GFR &gt;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span>.

The six-variable MDRD formula had superior accuracy compared with the four-variable MDRD formula as well as with the CKD-EPI equations in identifying patients with GFR &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>. However, the six-variable MDRD underestimated kidney function in patients with GFR &gt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>.</p><p/><p>A 24-hour collection for creatinine clearance is also likely to overestimate GFR in patients with renal disease as the contribution of tubular secretion of creatinine to total clearance is increased in this subset of patients. This was best shown in a systematic review and meta-analysis of seven studies of 193 patients with liver cirrhosis in which the measured creatinine clearance was compared with true GFR (as assessed by inulin clearance) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-function-and-nonrenal-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Overall, the measured creatinine clearance overestimated inulin clearance by a mean of 13 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, with the overestimation being highest in those with the lowest true GFRs. Among those with inulin clearance of less than 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (stage 4 and 5 CKD), the measured creatinine clearance correctly classified 64 percent of patients, incorrectly classified 23 percent of patients as having GFRs between 30 to 59 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and incorrectly classified 14 percent as having GFRs &ge;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. </p><p>Some, but not all, studies suggest that cystatin C level measurement (where available) is a more sensitive indicator of kidney function than the serum creatinine concentration in patients with liver or heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-function-and-nonrenal-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>].

We obtain urinary sodium or fractional excretion of sodium, which may also provide important diagnostic information for hepatorenal syndrome in patients awaiting liver transplantation, or for low cardiac output states in heart transplant candidates. Such conditions represent situations in which the renal hemodynamic state usually improves with appropriate organ transplantation and where kidney function may be expected to likewise undergo some degree of recovery.

A renal ultrasound can also provide information regarding echogenicity.

As an example, a kidney biopsy may help to differentiate intrinsic renal disease from renal hypoperfusion.</p><p>Biopsy may be performed percutaneously under ultrasound or CT guidance if the patient condition allows, but it may be complicated by bleeding. In a retrospective series in which 44 liver transplant candidates with abnormal kidney function of undetermined etiology for less than eight weeks duration underwent percutaneous renal biopsy, bleeding complications requiring at least one unit of blood occurred in 30 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-function-and-nonrenal-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. More than half of the complications were major, defined by the requirement for two or more units of blood <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intervention. By multivariable analysis, only International Normalized Ratio (INR) at the time of biopsy was an independent predictor of complication. A transjugular kidney biopsy should therefore be considered in patients with severe coagulopathy or on mechanical ventilation in whom a percutaneous approach may not be feasible or safe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-function-and-nonrenal-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-for-and-complications-of-renal-biopsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications for and complications of renal biopsy&quot;</a>).

A single-center study, for example, reported the kidney histology and renal outcomes of 30 liver transplant patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who underwent liver transplantation alone and had a kidney biopsy at the time of transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-function-and-nonrenal-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Immune-complex glomerulonephritis was noted in 25 patients, 12 with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, seven with IgA nephropathy, and six with mesangial glomerulonephritis; only one patient had a normal kidney biopsy. Of this cohort, 10 patients had normal serum creatinine levels, normal urinalysis results, and normal quantitative proteinuria. For five others, the only renal abnormality was an increased serum creatinine level. No patient had cryoglobulins in the blood or kidney. This study, together with others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-function-and-nonrenal-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/22,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,26</a>], highlights the lack of correlation between clinical parameters and renal histology in patients with decompensated liver or heart disease. However, whether post-liver or heart transplant progression of kidney disease is better predicted prior to surgery by renal histological damage, kidney function, or clinical judgment, taking into account the entire clinical picture, has not been established.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach in liver transplant candidates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since the introduction in 2002 of the MELD scoring system, which takes creatinine into account in prioritizing patients for liver transplantation, the proportion of liver recipients with impaired kidney function at the time of transplant has increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-function-and-nonrenal-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In parallel, the proportion of all liver transplants done as simultaneous liver-kidney transplants (SLK) has expanded from 2.2 percent in 1999 to almost 9 percent in 2014 (<a href=\"http://www.unos.org/&amp;token=y+affBeT3nDw7T4yvlrzckBR5p3UR3SZfc6/mTcMj1s=&amp;TOPIC_ID=7331\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.unos.org</a>). This has led to concerns that some liver transplant recipients who may have reversible renal injury are prematurely receiving kidney transplants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-function-and-nonrenal-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The introduction of the new kidney allocation system in 2014 has also unmasked concerns about the use of kidneys allocated as an SLK rather than as a kidney-alone transplant to ESRD patients. Because multi-organ allocation occurs before kidney-alone allocation, highly sensitized ESRD patients (with high priority in the new kidney-alone allocation system) lose the opportunity for potential kidney offers. In addition, approximately 50 percent of kidneys allocated for SLK are organs that, under kidney-alone allocation, would typically be prioritized for pediatric transplant candidates or young adults with the longest expected posttransplant survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-function-and-nonrenal-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Thus, an important goal in the evaluation of a liver transplant candidate with impaired kidney function is to determine if the patient should or should not be considered for SLK.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3560343169\"><span class=\"h3\">Eligibility criteria for SLK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>From a clinical standpoint, the most important determinant of the need for SLK in patients with end-stage liver disease and kidney dysfunction is the ability to understand the nature and the anticipated course of the renal disease after transplant. In particular, it is important to distinguish patients whose kidney injury is reversible (such as those with hepatorenal syndrome) from those with advanced irreversible renal disease.</p><p>In 2016, the United States Organ Procurement and Transplant Network (OPTN) and United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) formally approved a new policy with medical eligibility criteria for SLK allocation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-function-and-nonrenal-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In accordance with this policy, liver transplant candidates who meet one of the following criteria are eligible for SLK allocation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis of CKD with a measured or calculated GFR of &le;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> for more than 90 consecutive days <strong>and</strong> at least one of the following at the time of waiting list registration:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>ESRD on dialysis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Measured or calculated creatinine clearance or GFR &le;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis of sustained AKI <strong>and</strong> at least one of the following, for the last six weeks:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dialysis at least once every seven days</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Measured or calculated creatinine clearance or GFR of &le;25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> documented at least once every seven days</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis of metabolic disease, with an additional diagnosis of at least one of the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hyperoxaluria</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome from mutations in factor H or factor I</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Familial non-neuropathic systemic amyloidosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Methylmalonic aciduria</p><p/><p>In addition to the above criteria defining eligibility for SLK, the new policy also includes a safety-net component to ensure that a liver transplant patient who is not initially offered SLK but who remains dialysis dependent after liver transplantation would be highly prioritized for subsequent kidney-alone offers, if both of the following conditions are met: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The candidate is registered on the kidney waiting list between 60 and 365 days after liver transplantation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The candidate is either on chronic dialysis <strong>or</strong> has a measured or calculated creatinine clearance or GFR of &le;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span></p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3722612420\"><span class=\"h3\">Role of pretransplant kidney biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of pretransplant kidney biopsy in liver transplant candidates is uncertain. Kidney biopsy findings are not included in the 2016 <span class=\"nowrap\">OPTN/UNOS</span> criteria for selection of patients for SLK. Some experts propose a pre-liver transplant kidney biopsy to help make this determination.</p><p>In addition to establishing the cause of impaired kidney function, other potential benefits of kidney biopsy include the ability to determine chronicity, treatability, and likelihood of future progression or reversibility. Some have therefore suggested using the extent of glomerulosclerosis (&gt;40 percent) and interstitial fibrosis (&gt;30 percent) to guide selection of patients for SLK [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-function-and-nonrenal-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/20,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,29,30</a>]. Although this may represent useful information regarding chronicity of kidney injury, there are few data supporting the prognostic value of renal histology or its advantage over kidney function studies alone.</p><p>In one retrospective study, kidney biopsies were performed in 59 patients undergoing evaluation for SLK; all patients had a measured creatinine clearance of &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> proteinuria of &gt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-function-and-nonrenal-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Patients with &gt;40 percent glomerulosclerosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> &gt;30 percent interstitial fibrosis, or those on hemodialysis for more than two months, were recommended for SLK. Based upon these biopsy criteria, only 11 of 36 patients listed for transplant were listed for SLK, and allocation of a kidney could be avoided in 70 percent of liver transplant candidates with renal dysfunction. Among patients who underwent liver transplantation alone, the extent of glomerulosclerosis, but not interstitial fibrosis, predicted eGFR over the first 12 months posttransplant. However, the predictive ability of kidney biopsy decreased with greater time lapse between the biopsy and liver transplant. In another retrospective study, 22 percent of liver recipients whose pretransplant kidney biopsies were deemed to show reversible histology met criteria for kidney transplantation by 12 months post-liver transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-function-and-nonrenal-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Further studies are required to determine whether pretransplant renal biopsies can predict long-term renal outcomes after liver transplantation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach in heart transplant candidates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Up to one-third of all patients with New York Heart Association stage 3 or 4 end-stage heart failure have evidence of CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-function-and-nonrenal-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Despite this, the rate of combined heart-kidney transplantation is far lower than that of simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation, with 637 combined heart-kidney transplants in the US between 2000 and 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-function-and-nonrenal-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Over this period, the rate of combined heart-kidney transplantation as a proportion of all heart transplants performed has increased from approximately 1.25 percent in 2000 to over 3 percent in 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-function-and-nonrenal-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Registry data indicate that patients receiving double-organ transplantation are more likely to be African American, diabetic, older, and have worse kidney function at the time of transplantation than patients receiving heart transplant alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-function-and-nonrenal-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Overall, the data on the evaluation of kidney function prior to orthotopic heart transplant are less well defined than in liver transplant candidates, and no formal guidelines exist. However, the following general principles may help guide the evaluation process:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given that the combination of kidney dysfunction and severe heart failure is common, the nature of the kidney disease, in terms of chronicity and reversibility, must be determined. Patients with a predominant picture of hemodynamically mediated AKI (cardiorenal syndrome type 1) and without obvious intrinsic kidney disease (as determined by the lack of proteinuria, normal kidney size on ultrasonography, and the absence of severe histopathology in renal biopsy specimen) can recover sufficient native kidney function after restoration of renal perfusion to not need subsequent kidney replacement therapy for several years.

In this study, creatinine clearance decreased from 108 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> at baseline to 74 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> at five years posttransplantation in those who received pancreas transplantation, while kidney function did not change appreciably in diabetic controls. The decrement in creatinine clearance correlated with cyclosporine blood levels and dose.

In addition, it may contribute to a significant decrement in creatinine clearance within five years after transplantation.</p><p>It was postulated that the relatively short follow-up in this study may have prevented the renoprotective effects of normoglycemia, if present, from emerging. To address this limitation, the same investigators conducted a longer, 10-year study to discern the quantitative relevance of the competing factors of normoglycemia and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> nephrotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-function-and-nonrenal-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].

Ultrastructural examination of kidney tissue from these patients revealed that the thickness of the glomerular and tubular basement membranes was similar at five years and at baseline, but had decreased by 10 years. It was concluded that pancreas transplantation can reverse the lesions of diabetic nephropathy, but reversal requires more than five years of normoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-function-and-nonrenal-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/80,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,81</a>].</p><p>The natural history of kidney function following pancreas transplantation alone is characterized by an initial decline in renal function, due most likely to the untoward effect of calcineurin inhibitors.

Increasing dialysis duration was associated with worse outcomes after the kidney transplant, with patient death accounting for over 75 percent of kidneys that were lost. The fact that kidney quality (living versus deceased donors; standard criteria versus expanded criteria) was not a determinant of survival suggests that use of nonstandard kidneys should be readily considered in this population, rather than spending more time on the list waiting for a standard-criteria kidney.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Lung transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CKD is common following lung transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-function-and-nonrenal-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/44,51,54,68,103-108\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,51,54,68,103-108</a>].

The evaluation of renal function begins with a complete history and physical examination, an accurate measure of renal function, a urinalysis, and renal ultrasonography. Although renal biopsy may be clinically indicated on occasion, there is no evidence that renal histology is more predictive of posttransplant kidney outcomes than serum creatinine alone. Further options depend upon the particular clinical scenario and the particular nonrenal solid organ that is failing. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of kidney function prior to nonrenal organ transplant'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Calcineurin inhibitor therapy has been implicated as an important cause of posttransplantation CKD in nonrenal solid organ transplant recipients. An increased risk of CKD in this population is also associated with pretransplant acute kidney injury (AKI), increasing age at transplant, African-American race, female sex, pretransplantation hypertension and diabetes mellitus, type of organ transplanted, surgical issues, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hepatitis C infection.

There are limited data concerning islet cell and intestinal transplantation.
