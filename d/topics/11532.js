Histologic studies show typical changes due to rheumatic disease. The rheumatic process typically involves the mitral valve as well; as a result, most patients with rheumatic AS also have mitral stenosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mitral regurgitation.

Worldwide, rheumatic valve disease is most common and mitral valve involvement invariably accompanies rheumatic aortic valve disease. In North America and Europe, aortic valve disease is primarily due to calcific disease of a native trileaflet valve or a congenitally bicuspid valve.</p><p>The prevalence of AS increases with age as demonstrated by a prospective population-based study of 3273 participants including 164 subjects with AS. The prevalence of AS varied from 0.2 percent at ages 50 to 59 years, to 1.3 percent at ages 60 to 69, 3.9 percent at ages 70 to 79 years, and 9.8 percent at ages 80 to 89 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-epidemiology-and-prognosis-of-aortic-stenosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

This progression is manifested by a reduction in the aortic valve area and an increase in the transvalvular systolic pressure gradient. </p><p>In individuals with normal aortic valves, the effective area of valve opening equals the cross-sectional area of the left ventricular outflow tract, which is approximately 3 to 4 cm<sup>2</sup> in adults. As aortic leaflet thickening and calcification develop, the antegrade velocity remains normal and there is a minimal valve gradient until the orifice area reaches less than half of normal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aortic-valve-area-in-aortic-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aortic valve area in aortic stenosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When AS becomes hemodynamically significant, it results in an increased impedance or resistance to left ventricular ejection. The stenotic process is gradual in onset and progression, resulting in adaptive changes in the left ventricle. The increased systolic pressure in the ventricular chamber leads to concentric hypertrophy as a compensatory adaptive mechanism to maintain normal wall stress. With a compensated ventricle, the ejection fraction, the cardiac output, and the left ventricular end-diastolic volume remain normal for a prolonged period despite a systolic pressure gradient between the left ventricle and peripheral arterial system. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemodynamics-of-valvular-disorders-as-measured-by-cardiac-catheterization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemodynamics of valvular disorders as measured by cardiac catheterization&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, as stenosis severity and hypertrophy continue to progress, the left ventricle becomes less compliant and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure can become elevated even though the ventricular size remains normal. Abnormal diastolic function contributes to symptom onset and may persist after relief of stenosis due to persistent interstitial fibrosis. Another contributing factor to the reduction in ventricular function is incoordinate contraction, resulting from regional wall motion abnormalities, fibrosis, or subendocardial ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-epidemiology-and-prognosis-of-aortic-stenosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H196135663\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The natural history of AS begins with a prolonged asymptomatic period. In general, symptoms in patients with AS and normal left ventricular systolic function rarely occur until the stenosis is severe (valve area is &lt;1 cm<sup>2</sup>, the jet velocity is over 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/sec,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the mean transvalvular gradient exceeds 40 mmHg) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F95224\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95224 \">table 2</a>). Many patients do not develop symptoms until critical valve obstruction is present, while some patients become symptomatic when the stenosis is less severe, particularly if there is coexisting aortic regurgitation. Thus, serial hemodynamic measurements alone do <strong>not</strong>&nbsp;identify the time of symptom onset. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aortic-stenosis-in-adults#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aortic stenosis in adults&quot;, section on 'Symptoms'</a>.)</p><p>Many, if not most, patients with AS develop symptoms before the onset of left ventricular systolic dysfunction. However, in some patients, there is a reduction in systolic myocardial function and a decrease in the ability of the left ventricle to develop pressure and shorten against a load before the onset of symptoms. At this point, the left ventricle is transitioning to failure, resulting in reductions in stroke volume and cardiac output, and eventually signs and symptoms of overt heart failure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21854343\"><span class=\"h2\">Observational studies</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H196135109\"><span class=\"h3\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies of patients undergoing serial cardiac catheterization have identified subgroups of patients with AS with distinctly different progression rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-epidemiology-and-prognosis-of-aortic-stenosis/abstract/4-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-10</a>].

The average rate of progression has been similar in numerous studies, but the rate of progression varies widely among individual patients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The average rate of increase in the mean systolic pressure gradient was 3 to 7 mmHg per year, but some patients showed an increase of as much as 15 to 19 mmHg per year.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Valve area declined at an average rate of 0.1 cm<sup>2</sup> per year, but some patients had little or no progression and others progressed more rapidly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aortic jet velocity increased by an average of 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/sec</span> per year, but this is also variable.

Mortality in patients with AS dramatically increases after the development of cardiac symptoms. This observation, along with improved survival rates following valve replacement, is the basis for the recommendation for prompt valve replacement in such patients (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-for-valve-replacement-in-aortic-stenosis-in-adults#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications for valve replacement in aortic stenosis in adults&quot;, section on 'Evidence'</a>).

In later series, some medically treated symptomatic patients underwent balloon aortic valvuloplasty for palliation, but their clinical outcomes were not substantially changed by this procedure, which has been shown not to improve prognosis in adults with severe AS (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=percutaneous-balloon-aortic-valvotomy#H114805108\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Percutaneous balloon aortic valvotomy&quot;, section on 'Outcomes and limitations'</a>). The high mortality rates observed in symptomatic patients who do not undergo valve replacement may be in part due to comorbidities that preclude surgery.</p><p>The following examples demonstrate the high mortality rate associated with severe symptomatic AS:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A review of studies performed during 1913 to 1970 found that mean survival after onset of heart failure ranged from 0.5 to 2.8 years, after onset of syncope ranged from 0.8 to 3.8 years, and after onset of angina ranged from 2 to 4.7 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-epidemiology-and-prognosis-of-aortic-stenosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].
