Multiple clinical variants of porokeratosis exist. Malignant transformation occurs in a minority of cases.</p><p>Although clinical surveillance for malignant transformation is sufficient for the management of most patients with porokeratosis, patients who are concerned about the appearance of lesions or who have associated symptoms such as pruritus or pain may desire therapeutic intervention. Formal studies of the therapeutic options for porokeratosis are lacking, but various topical, excisional, destructive, and systemic therapies appear to be effective in some patients.</p><p>The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of porokeratosis will be reviewed here. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H959602\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The defining feature of porokeratosis is the clinical and histopathologic presence of a cornoid lamella, which typically manifests as a thin keratotic rim at the periphery of a slightly atrophic skin lesion. The most commonly described variants of porokeratosis include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP, OMIM #175900, #607728, #612293, and #612353)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disseminated superficial porokeratosis (DSP)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Porokeratosis of Mibelli (OMIM #175800)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Linear porokeratosis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Porokeratosis plantaris palmaris et disseminata (porokeratosis palmaris et plantaris disseminata, PPPD, OMIM #175850)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Punctate porokeratosis<strong> </strong>(sometimes considered a variant of PPPD) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H725539\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clonal proliferation of abnormal epidermal keratinocytes is believed to account for the clinical manifestations of porokeratosis. However, the pathway that leads to this process remains unknown. A variety of factors have been proposed as potential contributors, including genetic susceptibility, ultraviolet radiation, and immune status.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H959617\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inherited or sporadic genetic defects likely play an important role in porokeratosis. Studies in familial cases of disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP) support an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with incomplete penetrance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Four potential chromosomal loci for DSAP have been identified, including DSAP1 (12q23.2-24.1), DSAP2 (15q25.1-26.1), DSAP3 (1p31.3-p31.1), and DSAP 4 (16q24.1-24.3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. In Chinese studies, mutations in the phosphomevalonate kinase gene (<em>PMVK</em>), which is located at 12q24, have been detected in some patients with DSAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].</p><p>Similarly, familial cases of disseminated superficial porokeratosis (DSP) and porokeratosis plantaris palmaris et disseminata (PPPD) demonstrate autosomal dominant inheritance patterns. The loci linked to DSP and PPPD are on chromosome 18p11.3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>] and chromosome 12q24.1-24.2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], respectively.</p><p>Focal forms of porokeratosis, such as porokeratosis of Mibelli and linear porokeratosis may occur as a consequence of mosaicism. The occurrence of linear porokeratosis or porokeratosis of Mibelli in patients with DSAP has been attributed to this theory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/1,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12</a>]. In such cases, focal loss of heterozygosity via somatic mutations may result in the prominent, localized clinical manifestations that characterize linear porokeratosis and porokeratosis of Mibelli, while the relatively milder manifestations of DSAP appear in a generalized distribution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/1,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inheritance-patterns-of-monogenic-disorders-mendelian-and-non-mendelian#H53669611\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inheritance patterns of monogenic disorders (Mendelian and non-Mendelian)&quot;, section on 'Mosaicism'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H959624\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultraviolet radiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exposure to ultraviolet radiation may contribute to the development of porokeratosis. This assertion is supported by the observation that DSAP preferentially occurs on areas of exposed skin and in individuals with histories of extensive sun exposure. In addition, the administration of artificial ultraviolet light in experimental settings has resulted in the induction of DSAP lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. </p><p>Despite these findings, a definitive role for ultraviolet radiation in porokeratosis remains uncertain. Improvement in DSAP after treatment with psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy has been documented in one patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The relative sparing of the face in DSAP also raises questions about the designation of ultraviolet radiation as a contributory factor. (See <a href=\"#H725555\" class=\"local\">'Disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H959631\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunosuppression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drug-related immunosuppression or immunodeficiency in the setting of benign diseases or hematologic malignancy may increase risk for porokeratosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/16-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-22</a>]. Estimates of the incidence of porokeratosis in immunosuppressed organ transplant recipients have ranged from less than 1 percent to as high as 11 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/18,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,21</a>]. </p><p>Porokeratosis has occurred three weeks to 14 years after the initiation of systemic immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/21,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,23</a>]. DSP and porokeratosis of Mibelli are the most commonly associated variants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p>A contributory role for immunosuppression is supported by reports of remission of porokeratosis after cessation of immunosuppressive therapy in two patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. The development of porokeratosis in sites of long-term potent topical corticosteroid use in another patient also suggests a role for immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H959795\"><span class=\"h2\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Additional factors that have been associated with porokeratosis include radiation therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>], trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>], solid organ cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>], and Crohn's disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H725547\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL VARIANTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple clinical variants of porokeratosis have been described. Disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP) is generally accepted to be the most common variant, followed by porokeratosis of Mibelli. In one series of 31 patients in Singapore, DSAP, classical porokeratosis of Mibelli, linear porokeratosis, and porokeratosis plantaris palmaris et disseminata (PPPD) accounted for 42, 35, 13, and 10 percent of cases of porokeratosis, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>As noted above, the unifying feature of the variants of porokeratosis is the cornoid lamella. Lesions typically begin as small keratotic papules that spread slowly and centrifugally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H725555\"><span class=\"h2\">Disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP) is the most common type of porokeratosis. DSAP occurs more frequently in women than men, with an estimated female to male ratio of approximately 1.8:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The onset of disease typically occurs in the third or fourth decade of life, and patients frequently report a history of extensive exposure to natural or artificial ultraviolet radiation. Worsening of disease during the summer months may occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>DSAP is characterized by erythematous, skin-colored, or hyperpigmented well-defined macules that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F59742%7EDERM%2F81874%7EDERM%2F80248\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59742 graphicRef81874 graphicRef80248 \">picture 1C, 1F-G</a>). The cornoid lamella is often subtle, manifesting as a fine peripheral keratotic ridge. The distribution of lesions typically involves the extensor surfaces of the arms, legs, shoulders, or back, with sparing of the palms and soles. Facial lesions, a less common finding, occur in approximately 15 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p>The number of skin lesions in DSAP is variable. Only a few or several hundred lesions may be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The cosmetic appearance of DSAP is a common concern for patients with this disorder, and may be particularly bothersome for individuals who frequently wear skirts or shorts that expose the lower legs. Skin lesions are often asymptomatic, but pruritus or stinging sensations are estimated to occur in one-third to one-half of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/15,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,24</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H726119\"><span class=\"h2\">Disseminated superficial porokeratosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Disseminated superficial porokeratosis (DSP) resembles DSAP but lacks photodistribution, appearing in both sun-exposed and non-sun-exposed sites. Like DSAP, the palms and soles are typically spared.</p><p>In contrast to DSAP, DSP often develops in childhood, most commonly between the ages of 5 and 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. As noted above, DSP also can occur in association with immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>] (see <a href=\"#H959631\" class=\"local\">'Immunosuppression'</a> above). In addition, DSP has been reported in a few patients with solid organ malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. </p><p>The term &quot;eruptive disseminated porokeratosis&quot; has been proposed for adult-onset, acute disseminated porokeratosis, which has a male preponderance and may show variable morphology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Most patients with adult-onset DSP are immunosuppressed or have a coexisting internal malignancy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H725563\"><span class=\"h2\">Porokeratosis of Mibelli</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Porokeratosis of Mibelli is the second most common type of porokeratosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The disorder often begins in childhood and affects males approximately twice as frequently as females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Occasionally, lesions develop during adulthood, often in association with immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/17,19,21,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,19,21,42</a>]. </p><p>Porokeratosis of Mibelli typically begins as a small, asymptomatic or slightly pruritic papule that slowly expands over the course of years. Faster growth may occur in the setting of immunosuppression. Well-developed lesions are usually a few centimeters in diameter, and rarely, lesions grow to 10 to 20 cm in size. The term &quot;giant porokeratosis&quot; has been used to describe these exceptionally large lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].</p><p>The classic location for porokeratosis of Mibelli is on an extremity. However, lesions may occur in any site, including the palms, soles, genitalia, or mucous membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/24,45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,45,46</a>]. Patients usually present with a solitary lesion or a few asymmetrically distributed lesions. Occasionally widespread lesions occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/12,43,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,43,47</a>]. </p><p>The cornoid lamella is often prominent in lesions of porokeratosis of Mibelli. The lesion border is usually greater than 1 mm in height and a thin furrow is typically seen in the center of the ridge, causing an appearance that resembles the Great Wall of China (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F81011%7EDERM%2F62674%7EDERM%2F78667\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81011 graphicRef62674 graphicRef78667 \">picture 1A, 1H-I</a>). The center of the lesion may be slightly hypopigmented or hyperpigmented, minimally scaly, slightly atrophic, and hairless. Uncommonly, lesions manifest as confluent hyperkeratotic or verrucous thick plaques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H725578\"><span class=\"h2\">Linear porokeratosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Linear porokeratosis is a rare form of porokeratosis that may represent a segmental form of DSAP or DSP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/1,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12</a>]. The skin lesions typically present during infancy or early childhood but occasionally develop in adults. Females are slightly more likely to be affected than males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>The distribution of linear porokeratosis can be localized or generalized, and the configuration of lesions usually follows the lines of Blaschko (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57219\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57219 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F73545%7EDERM%2F50928\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73545 graphicRef50928 \">picture 1E, 1J</a>). The localized variant of linear porokeratosis presents as single or multiple plaques with hyperkeratotic peripheral rims on one extremity. As in porokeratosis of Mibelli, the hyperkeratotic border is often prominent, and a furrow is seen just inside of the hyperkeratotic ridge. In the generalized form of linear porokeratosis, lesions are found on more than one extremity or on the trunk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H725586\"><span class=\"h2\">Porokeratosis plantaris palmaris et disseminata</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Porokeratosis plantaris palmaris et disseminata (PPPD) is a rare variant of porokeratosis that may develop at any age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Lesions customarily first appear in adolescence or early adulthood.</p><p>The initial manifestations of PPPD are multiple small, relatively uniform macules on the palms and soles that exhibit a slightly hyperpigmented and atrophic center and a minimally raised peripheral ridge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-51</a>]. A serpiginous configuration may evolve over time. </p><p>Patients with PPPD can also develop lesions on the trunk and extremities that resemble lesions of DSAP and DSP. Involvement of the oral mucosa may also occur as multiple small, depressed, opalescent rings with hyperemic borders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>The lesions of PPPD may be asymptomatic, pruritic, or tender to palpation.

Some authors consider punctate porokeratosis to be a forme fruste of PPPD, rather than a separate entity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H190517\"><span class=\"h2\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>&quot;Porokeratosis ptychotropica&quot; is an unusual psoriasiform variant of porokeratosis. This type of porokeratosis typically presents in male patients with inflammatory keratotic plaques on the buttocks or genital skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Pathology shows numerous histopathologic foci of cornoid lamellae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-57</a>]. Lesions of porokeratosis ptychotropica are often mistaken for psoriasis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F53110%7EDERM%2F61803\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53110 graphicRef61803 \">picture 2A-B</a>).</p><p>Other subtypes of porokeratosis that have been described in the literature include follicular porokeratosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/58-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-61</a>], eruptive pruritic papular porokeratosis in the setting of DSP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/62-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">62-64</a>], giant porokeratosis (see <a href=\"#H725563\" class=\"local\">'Porokeratosis of Mibelli'</a> above), and porokeratosis associated with craniosynostosis, delayed closure of the fontanel, cranial defects, clavicular hypoplasia, anal and genitourinary malformations, and skin eruption (CDAGS syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H725594\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of porokeratosis often can be made based solely on clinical examination. The clinical appearance of an atrophic macule or patch with a well-defined, raised, hyperkeratotic ridge suggests this disorder. Marker ink or iodine can be used to highlight the appearance of the cornoid lamella in subtle cases. Self-tanning lotions containing dihydroxyacetone also highlight the cornoid lamella.</p><p>Skin biopsies usually are not necessary.

Small lesions may be removed entirely by shave excision. A punch biopsy of the lesion edge may also be performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skin-biopsy-techniques#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skin biopsy techniques&quot;, section on 'Biopsy techniques'</a>.)</p><p>The classic histopathologic feature of porokeratosis is the cornoid lamella, a thin column of tightly packed parakeratotic cells within a keratin-filled epidermal invagination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F61211%7EDERM%2F67831%7EDERM%2F66289\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61211 graphicRef67831 graphicRef66289 \">picture 3A-C</a>).

A moderate lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate is typically present in the papillary dermis. Dermal amyloid deposits are occasionally seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/55,67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,67,68</a>].

Since no randomized trials have evaluated therapies for porokeratosis and the available data are insufficient for definitive recommendations on management, the approach to therapy is based primarily upon factors such as lesion size, lesion location, aesthetic considerations, treatment availability, and patient preference. If the intent of treatment is removal for malignancy prophylaxis, more definitive procedures such as surgical excision or lesion destruction are typically recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/21,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,80</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H654953688\" class=\"local\">'Malignant transformation'</a> below.)</p><p>Our general approach to benign-appearing lesions that are being treated for symptomatic or cosmetic reasons is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who desire quick therapy for a few small lesions and who would not be disturbed by residual changes in skin pigmentation or scarring, we typically treat with cryotherapy, electrodesiccation and curettage, or surgical excision.

One review of 281 patients with porokeratosis found risks for malignant transformation in patients with linear porokeratosis, porokeratosis plantaris palmaris et disseminata, porokeratosis of Mibelli of any size, and DSAP of 19, 10, 8, and 3 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/136\" class=\"abstract_t\">136</a>].

Factors such as the estimated risk for malignancy for specific lesion types and the risk for significant cosmetic or functional defects following removal must be considered. The removal of the lesions with the greatest risk for malignancy (linear porokeratosis or large porokeratosis of Mibelli) often would result in an unfavorable amount of scarring. Moreover, the large number of lesions and low risk for malignancy in individual lesions of DSAP or DSP suggest that the benefit of lesion removal for the prevention of malignancy in these variants is likely to be minimal. </p><p>The ability to clinically follow lesions of porokeratosis for signs or symptoms of malignancy and the high likelihood of successful treatment of malignancy once it develops support clinical surveillance as an acceptable method of management, and thus, most patients with porokeratosis are followed clinically. We suggest the following approach to managing these patients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patient education </strong>&ndash; All patients should be educated about warning signs for malignancy. Patients should be instructed to return for follow-up if changes occur in a previously stable lesion, such as the development of induration, ulceration, nodularity, bleeding, crusting, or rapid growth. Similarly, patients should return for reevaluation if new symptoms develop in lesions (eg, prickling or tingling sensations or pain).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sun protection </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>The implementation of sun-protective practices is recommended to reduce actinic damage as well as to avoid sun-induced impairment in cutaneous immune surveillance, both of which may increase risk for cutaneous malignancy. (See <a href=\"#H959933\" class=\"local\">'General measures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Routine follow-up </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Patients should be followed annually to monitor for signs and symptoms of malignancy, to screen for changes in health status that might suggest an underlying systemic disorder, and to reinforce sun protection education. Any lesion that exhibits clinical features concerning for malignancy (eg, induration, ulceration, bleeding, crusting, or rapid growth) should be excised or biopsied for histopathological examination. Although malignant transformation in DSAP and DSP are rare, the frequent presence of additional risk factors for cutaneous malignancy (eg, history of extensive sun exposure or immunosuppression) makes close clinical follow-up of these patients worthwhile.</p><p/><p>If the decision is made to excise or destroy a lesion for prophylactic purposes, doing so in an urgent manner is not necessary, as the period between lesion development and malignancy often spans decades (see <a href=\"#H654953688\" class=\"local\">'Malignant transformation'</a> above). After removal, clinical follow-up still should be performed yearly to evaluate these patients for the development of new or recurrent lesions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3504151047\"><span class=\"h3\">Immunocompromised patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although systemic immunosuppression has not been proven to increase the risk for malignant transformation in lesions of porokeratosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], immunosuppression is a known risk factor for cutaneous malignancy. Thus, skin examinations are often performed more than once yearly for skin cancer surveillance in this population regardless of the presence or absence of porokeratosis. The exact frequency of follow-up is dependent upon the individual's risk factors for skin cancer and his or her personal history of actinic keratoses or malignant lesions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-management-of-skin-cancer-in-solid-organ-transplant-recipients#H2294684\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and management of skin cancer in solid organ transplant recipients&quot;, section on 'Follow-up'</a>.)</p><p>Some authors have advocated routine surgical removal or destruction of porokeratosis lesions in immunosuppressed patients due to concern for an increased risk for metastasis in these patients once squamous cell carcinoma has developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/21,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,80</a>]. However, as noted above, complete removal of lesions at greatest risk for malignancy often is impractical; thus, we follow most of these patients clinically.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H312602732\"><span class=\"h3\">Role of pharmacologic agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic retinoids are occasionally used for the management of patients with severe porokeratosis. Based upon studies in squamous cell carcinoma, the risk for malignant transformation to squamous cell carcinoma may be reduced during active treatment with systemic retinoids. However, this has not been directly studied in porokeratosis, and the long-term impact of retinoid therapy on malignant transformation of these lesions is unknown. The effect of topical therapies on the risk for malignancy also is uncertain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma#H32\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and risk factors for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Oral retinoids'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H191710\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Porokeratosis is a disorder of keratinization that is distinguished from other skin disorders by the presence of a characteristic ridge-like keratotic border called a cornoid lamella. A variety of types of porokeratosis have been described, all of which share this distinctive feature. (See <a href=\"#H959602\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathogenesis of porokeratosis is poorly understood. Factors such as genetic susceptibility, exposure to ultraviolet radiation, and immunosuppression may contribute to lesion development. (See <a href=\"#H725539\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP) is the most common form of porokeratosis. Patients are typically adults with a history of extensive sun exposure. Few or many small, porokeratotic macules are usually present on the extensor extremities. (See <a href=\"#H725555\" class=\"local\">'Disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Porokeratosis of Mibelli is the second most common type of porokeratosis. Lesions most commonly begin in childhood but may occur in adults, particularly in the setting of immunosuppression. An annular plaque a few centimeters in diameter with a prominent keratotic ridge is the typical clinical finding. (See <a href=\"#H725563\" class=\"local\">'Porokeratosis of Mibelli'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical examination is usually sufficient for the diagnosis of porokeratosis. Skin biopsies may be useful in the setting of atypical lesions or lesions that are suspicious for malignant transformation. Biopsy of the periphery of the lesion characteristically demonstrates a narrow column of parakeratosis. (See <a href=\"#H725594\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malignant transformation is estimated to occur in 7.5 to 11 percent of patients with porokeratosis. Malignancy is most likely to occur in lesions of linear porokeratosis or giant porokeratosis (a form of porokeratosis of Mibelli). Complete removal or destruction of lesions to prevent malignant transformation often is impractical. Thus, patients with porokeratosis should be followed closely for signs of malignant disease. (See <a href=\"#H1078557566\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis and malignant transformation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment is not required for most patients with porokeratosis but may be desired by patients with symptomatic or cosmetically distressing lesions. (See <a href=\"#H725618\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with only a few small lesions who desire rapid treatment for symptomatic or cosmetic purposes and who are willing to accept treatment-related pigment changes or scarring, we suggest treatment with cryotherapy, electrodesiccation and curettage, or surgical excision (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with large or multiple lesions or who are concerned about the possibility of scarring with the interventions above, we suggest treatment with topical therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Topical 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiquimod-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imiquimod</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ingenol-mebutate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ingenol mebutate</a> may be used for the treatment of localized areas. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topical-tretinoin-topical-all-trans-retinoic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Topical tretinoin</a> and topical vitamin D analogs are less irritating therapeutic options but may require long courses of therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional choices for lesion destruction include dermabrasion, laser therapy, and photodynamic therapy. (See <a href=\"#H553341\" class=\"local\">'Physical interventions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment with systemic retinoids is usually reserved for severe cases. Relapse is likely after treatment cessation. (See <a href=\"#H553623\" class=\"local\">'Systemic therapy'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porokeratosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Murase J, Gilliam AC.
