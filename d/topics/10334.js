Opioids are a recommended treatment for cancer pain and have been increasingly used for the treatment of chronic nonmalignant pain. In the United States, one study estimated that approximately 3 percent of patients in the primary care setting were receiving chronic opioid therapy for pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-pain-in-the-patient-chronically-using-opioids/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Patients receiving chronic opioid therapy for pain often experience episodes of acute pain, either because of a new injury or surgical procedure. Acute pain may also develop in patients who are receiving chronic opioid maintenance therapy for addiction or who are chronically using inappropriately prescribed or illegally obtained opioids.

Central sensitization is a mechanism for persistent or chronic pain that is caused by amplified synaptic transfer of pain signals from the nociceptor terminal to dorsal horn neurons; the glutamate-activated N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor is thought to be integral to this process.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In patients receiving chronic therapy with opioids, chronic stimulation of opioid receptors produces increased sensitivity to pain through a variety of mechanisms, including central activation of NMDA receptors and protein kinase C, upregulation of spinal dynorphin, and apoptosis of spinal dorsal horn neurons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-pain-in-the-patient-chronically-using-opioids/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. In studies of patients using opioids for an addiction disorder and those maintained on them for chronic pain, cold pressor tests have found pain sensitivity to be increased by 42 to 72 percent compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-pain-in-the-patient-chronically-using-opioids/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This phenomenon of central sensitization is implicated both in opioid tolerance (ie, the requirement for higher doses of opioids to maintain the same level of analgesia) as well as opioid-induced hyperalgesia, in which patients with chronic opioid exposure become more likely to experience pain with less noxious stimuli. Patients with OIH paradoxically experience less pain relief with increasing opioid doses and, as OIH increases, their pain may become more diffuse or otherwise change in quality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-opioids-in-the-management-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain#H1658035998\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of opioids in the management of chronic non-cancer pain&quot;, section on 'Adverse effects'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-management-of-side-effects-in-patients-receiving-opioids-for-chronic-pain#H1335116040\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and management of side effects in patients receiving opioids for chronic pain&quot;, section on 'Opioid-induced hyperalgesia'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinician-related barriers also lead to poor analgesia in opioid-tolerant patients. These include a lack of knowledge about opioid equivalent doses, stigmatization of all opioid-tolerant individuals as &ldquo;addicts&rdquo; or &ldquo;drug seekers&rdquo; when current doses are inadequate, and fear of causing an overdose when prescribing the higher doses of opioids that are required to treat pain in opioid-tolerant patients. Moreover, some patients taking prescribed opioids may have a substance use disorder that clinicians may lack the training to identify and treat. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease#H2898465372\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vaso-occlusive pain management in sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Provider misperceptions that interfere with the assessment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=opioid-use-disorder-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-course-screening-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Opioid use disorder: Epidemiology, pharmacology, clinical manifestations, course, screening, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">System-wide impediments to optimal analgesic therapy may include financial concerns (eg, lack of healthcare insurance coverage, inability to purchase drugs), a limited number of specialists in pain management or palliative care, and an incentive structure in the healthcare system that does not encourage physicians to manage pain as a priority. Finally, medications with the potential for abuse and addiction such as opioids are regulated with restrictions on whether and how they can be prescribed. The regulations that are aimed at preventing <span class=\"nowrap\">abuse/addiction</span> can make it difficult to prescribe adequate analgesia to patients with legitimate pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-pain-management-general-principles-and-risk-management-for-patients-receiving-opioids#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer pain management: General principles and risk management for patients receiving opioids&quot;, section on 'Risk assessment and management for patients receiving opioids'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the United States, increasing rates of prescription drug abuse have prompted the federal government to take additional steps to regulate opioids (eg, the development and mandated use of <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/InformationbyDrugClass/ucm163647.htm&amp;token=8RYIFfyLhIBYEqeX7m6uPGtnB1wPEGG5AqBctyC78FWNGw+6UqbQagwqweZcANKrwh+moLZwcDmVFe62Yio+MEtisDt27nd5FzPpNWJoHPw=&amp;TOPIC_ID=83726\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies [REMS]</a>). The intent of these regulations, which is to reduce opioid abuse, is widely supported by clinicians. However, concerns have been raised that efforts to reduce risk could create barriers to legitimate prescribing of opioids, the result of which will be more unrelieved pain.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2977960\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step in the evaluation of a patient with acute pain who is receiving chronic opioid therapy is a careful history, physical examination, and diagnostic studies to identify whether this represents an exacerbation of the baseline pain or a different pain altogether.

New pain in an area of known disease involvement may reflect a new complication. As examples, in a patient with cancer, acute pain may be caused by hemorrhage into a tumor, a pathologic fracture, epidural spinal cord compression, or <span class=\"nowrap\">obstruction/perforation</span> of a hollow viscus.

We recommend careful screening for psychiatric disorders for patients on chronic opioid therapy who present with acute pain or an exacerbation of chronic pain. Psychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), are more common in patients with chronic pain than in the general population, and a worsening of psychiatric issues may increase patients&rsquo; experience of pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-pain-in-the-patient-chronically-using-opioids/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Traumatic childhood events, such as sexual abuse, are also associated with chronic pain, particularly in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-pain-in-the-patient-chronically-using-opioids/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].

Though there are few data on the role of psychiatric disorders in acute pain, treatment of comorbid psychiatric disorders improves chronic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-pain-in-the-patient-chronically-using-opioids/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2977967\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT IN PATIENTS RECEIVING CHRONIC OPIOID THERAPY FOR PAIN</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H434000914\"><span class=\"h2\">Potentially treatable cause</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If possible,<strong> </strong>the underlying cause should be treated, if one has been identified.

These recommendations apply to patients taking opioid analgesics for pain. Management in patients using opioid substitution therapy for addiction and patients who are actively addicted to opioids, including heroin, is discussed in a separate section. (See <a href=\"#H2978032\" class=\"local\">'Special situations'</a> below.)</p><p>The clinician should first explore the patient&rsquo;s preexisting chronic pain complaint, including how the acute pain compares to the chronic pain in location, intensity, pattern, and quality. Asking about the patient&rsquo;s baseline chronic pain level on an average day, using a numerical scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62346\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62346 \">figure 1</a>), helps to assess the adequacy of previous pain control and compare the previous pain level with the current level of acute pain. The quantity of opioids used daily prior to the acute event should be ascertained as accurately as possible by asking about exact doses used, number of pills for each dose, and total number of pills used throughout the day.</p><p>Next, the patient&rsquo;s baseline opioid requirement should be calculated. The 24-hour oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> equivalent (OME) provides a basis for comparing strengths of different opioid regimens and helps calculate equianalgesic doses for oral, transdermal, and intravenous (IV) preparations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F111206\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111206 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F111207\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111207 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F111216\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111216 \">table 3</a>). As an example, consider a patient who has been on a 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/hour</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> patch for pain and who has used 40 mg of short-acting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydromorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydromorphone</a> within a 24 hour period. First, calculate the OME for the fentanyl. A 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/hour</span> patch worn for 24 hours is equivalent to approximately 200 mg of oral morphine per day (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F111216\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111216 \">table 3</a>). Then, calculate the total OME for the hydromorphone. Oral hydromorphone is about four times as potent as oral morphine, so 40 mg oral hydromorphone would be 160 mg OME. Adding them together, the patient has been taking opioids that are approximately equivalent to an OME of 360 mg daily.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2977982\"><span class=\"h3\">Choice of opioid route and regimen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient&rsquo;s previous long-acting oral or transdermal opioid should be continued, if possible. The oral route is preferred, if possible. If the individual is unable to swallow or this is a potential problem with absorption, the oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> equivalent can be converted into a parenterally dosed opioid and be administered either as a continuous infusion or using intermittent scheduled <span class=\"nowrap\">IV/subcutaneous</span> doses. Choosing the same opioid for acute pain management as the patient currently takes for chronic pain (eg, the use of IV morphine if the patient currently takes oral morphine) is preferred, as it will reduce the chance of side effects from a new agent. </p><p>In addition, if fast relief of severe acute pain is needed, adequate titration of analgesics may initially require IV or subcutaneous administration of short-acting opioids or patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). </p><p>PCA may represent the best choice for acute pain control in patients who are alert and who have the capacity to press a button to deliver analgesia. Studies in postoperative pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-pain-in-the-patient-chronically-using-opioids/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>] and in the emergency department [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-pain-in-the-patient-chronically-using-opioids/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>] suggest that PCAs are effective for acute pain and patient satisfaction is high. At least in the postoperative setting, PCA represents a standard approach to pain control.</p><p>If a PCA is used, the long-acting or transdermal opioids for basal pain relief should be continued or converted to an IV basal rate for the PCA.</p><p>More information on use of PCA for patients with cancer pain and in the postoperative setting is discussed separately.

This is the best choice for acute pain control in patients who are unable to manage PCA or who may require rapid dose titration. A comprehensive literature review about opioid-dose titration in severe cancer pain suggested that rapid dose titration using IV opioids can relieve pain in less than 24 hours while avoiding serious adverse events, such as respiratory depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-pain-in-the-patient-chronically-using-opioids/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

She is admitted for a new bone metastasis, and her pain level is 10 on a scale of 1 to 10. She is continued on the 240 mg of long-acting morphine orally. An appropriate intermittent oral dose for acute pain would be 10 to 20 percent of the OME dose, or 30 to 60 mg of oral morphine. Because IV morphine is three times more bioavailable than the oral form, the equivalent IV dose is 10 to 20 mg of IV morphine. She receives a 10 mg IV morphine dose, and after 15 minutes her pain decreases from 10 to 8 on a scale of 1 to 10. The patient then receives a 15 mg IV dose (ie, 50 percent increase, which decreases her pain to 3 on a scale of 1 to 10 without causing sedation). Her as-needed rescue dose will be 10 or 15 mg of IV morphine every two hours. Decision-making about when to add bolus doses to the basal requirement is addressed below.

As with intermittent opioid administration, the patient&rsquo;s previous long-acting opioid should be continued, if possible. If unable to do so, a continuous basal infusion on a PCA can be calculated to equal the patient&rsquo;s previous baseline long-acting opioid dose (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F111216\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111216 \">table 3</a>). The initial patient-controlled bolus dose should be 50 to 100 percent of the patient&rsquo;s previous <strong>hourly</strong> opioid requirement every 8 to 15 minutes. For example, to place the patient above on a PCA, convert her previous long-acting oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> equivalent (240 mg daily) into a continuous PCA infusion: 80 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">daily/24</span> hours = a continuous rate of 3.5 mg per hour. Her intermittent bolus dose would be 1.5 to 3.5 mg every 10 minutes. This allows her the flexibility to use from 9 to 21 mg of IV morphine per hour in addition to the continuous 3.5 mg per hour. </p><p>Most patients achieve adequate pain control relying on the PCA bolus, but for those whose pain level is stable and expected to continue at the current level, particularly if they have trouble sleeping through the night due to a need to press the PCA button frequently, we recommend reassessing the basal rate every 24 hours and increasing by not more than 50 percent based upon the day&rsquo;s bolus dosing. The continuous rate should be reevaluated daily and decreased if the pain level decreases.

A new acute pain may follow one of several patterns, depending on etiology and patient characteristics: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain from a specific treatable cause, such as appendicitis, may resolve after surgery. When acute pain is expected to resolve quickly, long-acting opioid doses should remain the same and the additional short-acting opioid doses can be titrated down to return the patient to his or her baseline regimen. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other types of pain, such as that from a pathologic fracture, may be treatable but not completely resolve in the short term. In situations such as this, it is expected that the patient&rsquo;s peak oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> equivalent will decrease over a period of time but may not return to baseline. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Still other patients may have pain that is likely to return to baseline but it is expected to take a significant amount of time, perhaps weeks (eg, patients with severe mucositis following hematopoietic cell transplantation). Still other etiologies may be minimally treatable and the patient may reach a higher, permanent baseline in opioid dosing. </p><p/><p>If a patient&rsquo;s increased pain is expected to last days to weeks, clinicians may choose to continue the same long-acting dose but allow liberal as needed bolus doses. On the other hand, some patients may prefer a temporary increase in long-acting medication. In this case, patients should be monitored closely for decreases in pain in order to titrate the long-acting doses.</p><p>When the pain has been controlled on the increased opioid doses for 24 to 48 hours and if the pain is expected to continue over the long term, recalculate the patient&rsquo;s new baseline oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> equivalent and convert that to an opioid regimen with two-thirds of the total daily dose in the form of a long-acting opioid. This allows for day to day fluctuations in pain and potential decreases in the patient&rsquo;s opioid requirements over time. Each short-acting dose should be equal to 10 percent of the total daily oral morphine equivalent, with doses allowed every three to four hours.</p><p>For example, the patient above is postoperative day three from surgery for her pathologic fracture. She has been using 600 mg of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> equivalent daily on her PCA. An appropriate new regimen would be 200 mg of long-acting morphine twice daily and 60 mg of short-acting morphine every three to four hours.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H542430533\"><span class=\"h4\">Opioid rotation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some cases, opioid titration is ineffective because of dose-limiting side effects or decreased effectiveness of the previously used opioid. Discontinuing the previous opioid and starting a new agent (&ldquo;opioid rotation&rdquo;) may improve analgesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-pain-in-the-patient-chronically-using-opioids/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>] due to the differing interactions of opioids with mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors and incomplete cross-tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-pain-in-the-patient-chronically-using-opioids/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Each opioid drug has a different potency, defined as the dose necessary to produce a given effect. The starting dose of the replacing drug must be close enough to its predicted equianalgesic dose to prevent the development of withdrawal (if the dose of the new drug is too low) or unintentional overdose (if it is too high). The equianalgesic dose tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F111206\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111206 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F111207\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111207 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F111216\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111216 \">table 3</a>) have been developed as a means for comparing potencies between opioids. Consulting tables such as these to calculate the equianalgesic dose between an existing regimen and a new one is only the first step, however. </p><p>To ensure that opioid rotation is done safely, clinical guidelines have been developed that incorporate reductions in the calculated equianalgesic dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-pain-in-the-patient-chronically-using-opioids/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

Patients with addiction disorders may be reluctant to admit the extent of their nonmedical use of opioids for fear of stigma. A nonjudgmental screening for substance use disorder and assessment for quantity of illicit opioids used is essential.

The setting of acute pain is not the time to attempt detoxification. When prescribing analgesics for patients with active opioid addiction in the inpatient setting, practitioners should plan to follow the guidelines as illustrated above for patients receiving MMT. However, an accurate baseline assessment of quantity of opioid use may be more difficult to obtain, as patients may be using heroin of uncertain potency or buying varying quantities of prescription opioids for illicit use. Therefore, practitioners should be prepared to titrate opioid doses rapidly if initial doses are ineffective due to tolerance.</p><p>In the ambulatory setting, patients with active addiction are more likely to be able to use their drug of choice. Prescription of opioid analgesics creates a risk of nonmedical use of these substances as well as the danger that they will be used in conjunction with unknown quantities of nonprescribed opioids and other substances.

Providers should be aware, however, that long-acting opioids can often be used via a nonprescribed route (such as crushing and taking a long-acting pill intranasally, or licking a fentanyl patch) and many of these preparations result in the drug having an acute euphoria and thus a high street value. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methadone</a> may be prescribed for ongoing pain in patients with coexisting addiction; however, with its variable half-life, multiple drug interactions, and the increasing incidence of deaths from methadone overdose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-pain-in-the-patient-chronically-using-opioids/abstract/56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-58</a>], we recommend this only for experienced providers.

(See <a href=\"#H2977960\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As a first step in prescribing opioid analgesics for patients on chronic opioid therapy, we recommend a careful assessment of the previous pain complaint, including adequacy of the previous opioid regimen and converting that amount into a baseline daily oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> equivalent (OME). (See <a href=\"#H2977967\" class=\"local\">'Treatment in patients receiving chronic opioid therapy for pain'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continue the patient&rsquo;s previous long-acting opioid if possible.

Practitioners should be prepared to titrate opioid doses rapidly if pain relief is not achieved. Rapid dose titration using intermittent opioid dosing reduces severe acute pain within 24 hours and is safe in a monitored setting such as a hospital. This method is the best choice in patients who are unable to use patient-controlled analgesia<strong> </strong>or who may require rapid increases in doses. (See <a href=\"#H2977989\" class=\"local\">'Intermittent opioids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) is effective for acute pain in the emergency department and postoperatively and is more broadly applicable to a variety of patients with acute pain who are receiving chronic therapy with opioids. For opioid-tolerant individuals, the initial patient bolus dose should be 50 to 100 percent of the patient&rsquo;s baseline hourly opioid requirement or 50 to 100 percent of the hourly continuous infusion rate if the patient&rsquo;s long-acting <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> transdermal opioids have been converted to a basal PCA rate. Bolus doses should be allowed every 8 to 15 minutes. (See <a href=\"#H2977996\" class=\"local\">'Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If opioid dose titration is ineffective or if side effects are prohibitive, rotation to a different opioid medication, with a 25 to 50 percent dose reduction, may improve analgesia due to the differing interactions of the new opioid with opioid receptors. (See <a href=\"#H542430533\" class=\"local\">'Opioid rotation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the pain has stabilized, clinician decision-making about when and how to add bolus opioid doses to the long-acting basal dose depends on the etiology and expected time course of the acute pain (see <a href=\"#H2978010\" class=\"local\">'When should bolus dosing be added to basal dosing'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>When acute pain is expected to resolve quickly, long-acting opioid doses should remain the same and the additional short-acting opioid doses can be titrated down to return the patient to his or her baseline regimen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the increased pain is expected to last days to weeks, clinicians may choose to continue the same long-acting dose but allow liberal as needed bolus doses. On the other hand, some patients may prefer a temporary increase in long-acting medication. In this case, patients should be monitored closely for decreases in pain in order to titrate the long-acting doses. In this latter situation, recalculate the patient&rsquo;s new baseline oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> equivalent and reconvert to an opioid regimen with two-thirds of the total daily dose in the form of a long-acting opioid. At the same time, each short-acting dose should be equal to 10 percent of the total daily oral morphine equivalent, with doses allowed every three to four hours for oral opioids.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonopioid strategies, including medications such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), steroids, anticonvulsants, interventional pain techniques, and complementary medicine, may provide additional benefit and decrease opioid requirements in patients with acute pain.
