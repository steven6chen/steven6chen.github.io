Clinical manifestations range from cutaneous ulcers to systemic multiorgan disease. Specific organisms are frequently associated with a typical clinical picture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F86988\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86988 \">table 1</a>), although this can be variable.</p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis will be reviewed here. Issues concerning treatment, epidemiology, and control are discussed separately.

Asymptomatic infection may occur in about 10 percent of patients; this has been suggested by delayed hypersensitivity skin testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leishmaniasis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p><em>Leishmania</em> causes a spectrum of cutaneous disease. The range of clinical manifestations may be attributed to variability in parasite virulence (and other intrinsic characteristics) and variability in the host immune response. At one end of the spectrum, mucosal leishmaniasis (ML) and leishmaniasis recidivans (LR) are caused by oligoparasitic disease associated with a marked cellular immune response. The center of the spectrum consists of localized cutaneous leishmaniasis (LCL), which is the most common clinical presentation. At the opposite end of the spectrum, diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis (DCL) is caused by polyparasitic disease with a predominance of parasitized macrophages and no granulomatous inflammation. This spectrum of clinical presentation and host immune response is similar to clinical manifestations observed in the setting of leprosy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leishmaniasis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-leprosy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of leprosy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The cutaneous syndromes associated with <em>Leishmania</em> parasite infection include LCL, LR, DCL, and ML. These will be further described below; they are presented in order of relative clinical frequency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83446480\"><span class=\"h2\">Localized cutaneous leishmaniasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cutaneous lesions tend to occur on exposed areas of the skin; sand fly mouthparts generally cannot penetrate through clothing. Sand fly bite reactions are generally pruritic but usually do not enlarge; they may resolve slowly over weeks (even in the absence of parasitic infection).</p><p>LCL begins as a pink-colored papule that enlarges and develops into a nodule or plaque-like lesion (often with central softening), leading to a painless ulceration with an indurated border (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F64620\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64620 \">picture 1</a>). In Old World CL, the ulcer is often covered with a hyperkeratotic eschar (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F87207\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87207 \">picture 2</a>). In New World CL, the ulcer may be covered with thick white-yellow fibrinous material (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F86992\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86992 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p>Multiple lesions may be present. The clinical appearance can be variable and may include sporotrichoid, verrucous, zosteriform, psoriaform, eczematous, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> erysipeloid features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leishmaniasis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Small satellite lesions may develop just outside the <span class=\"nowrap\">plaque/ulcer</span>. Spread of lesions along the draining lymphatics may be observed; these may or may not ulcerate but can be palpated subcutaneously and proximally along the lymphatic chain leading from the primary lesion (nodular lymphangitis). Regional adenopathy can occur and may be prominent in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leishmaniasis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Secondary bacterial infection of the ulcer may occur and may be associated with purulent drainage and local cellulitis. Bacterial superinfection may lead to enlargement of the primary lesion and contribute to its persistence.</p><p>The natural history of LCL consists of gradual healing over months to years; the time varies depending on the species and lesion size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leishmaniasis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>]. Leishmaniasis heals with an atrophic, depressed scar; it can also heal as a keloid (in patients predisposed to keloid scarring). Following resolution of the initial lesion(s), it is possible that reactivation of the initial lesion(s) may develop during the subsequent year (or later for ML).</p><p>There are some distinguishing clinical features between species, although significant overlap may occur; speciation should not be based solely on clinical manifestations.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>L.L. major</em> infection (Old World CL) typically has a short incubation period, and ulcers may expand in one to two months to &ge;6 cm in diameter. Multiple lesions are common. Frequently, ulcers are covered with a thick crust, and nodular, plaque-like lesions are common. Epithelialization of the ulcer bed usually occurs within six months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>L.L. tropica</em> infection (Old World CL) is typically a more chronic infection than CL due to <em>L.L. major</em>; it evolves over months to years. The skin lesions are relatively few in number and sometimes relatively small (1 to 2 cm). Facial lesions may be larger, and a predilection for the nose and forehead may be observed. The lesions are very dry and appear crusted. Spontaneous resolution is slow, usually over one to two years or longer. <em>L.L. tropica</em> can be associated with the complication of <em>Leishmania</em> recidivans. (See <a href=\"#H83446505\" class=\"local\">'Leishmaniasis recidivans'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>L.L. aethiopica</em> infection (Old World CL) usually consists of a solitary facial lesion with or without surrounding satellite papules, which coalesce into spreading nodules or plaques. Lesions may spread along mucocutaneous margins but do not involve the oral or nasal mucosa. <em>L.L. aethiopica</em> is associated with relatively long chronicity. Histologically, relatively little inflammation is seen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>L.L. infantum-chagasi</em> infection can cause a small number of slow-growing nodular lesions that persist for years. This is an Old World species most often associated with visceral leishmaniasis, but it can also cause CL; its presence in the skin does not imply coexistent visceral disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>L.L. mexicana</em> (New World CL) infection generally produces small, chronic skin ulcers, usually one or few in number. Lesions on the ear are called &quot;Chiclero&rsquo;s ulcer,&quot; which reflects the biting habits of the sand fly vector. <em>L.L. mexicana</em> lesions may spontaneously heal relatively quickly; one study noted 88 percent of lesions healed by 14 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leishmaniasis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>L.V. braziliensis</em> (New World CL) infection causes large lesions, frequently with lymphocutaneous involvement. A sporotrichoid pattern of multiple ulcers or nodular lymphangitis is common (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F64620\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64620 \">picture 1</a>). Lymphadenopathy, fever, and malaise may precede development of any lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leishmaniasis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Ulcers may heal in 6 to 12 months but can be quite persistent. <em>L.V. braziliensis</em> CL may be associated with mucosal leishmaniasis concurrently or subsequently.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1961622\"><span class=\"h3\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of LCL includes bacterial infection, cutaneous myiasis, pyoderma gangrenosum, ecthyma, impetigo, cutaneous malignancy, sarcoidosis, prurigo nodularis, lichen simplex chronicus, spider bite, tropical ulcer, yaws, cutaneous anthrax, nocardia and actinomycosis, cutaneous tuberculosis, nontuberculous mycobacteria such as <em>Mycobacterium marinum</em>, <em>M. fortuitum</em>, and less likely Buruli ulcer (<em>M. ulcerans</em>), and fungal infections such as sporotrichosis, blastomycosis, and chromoblastomycosis.</p><p>Clinical features that may help differentiate CL from these entities include its chronicity, general painlessness, frequent clustering of lesions, occurrence on an exposed location, and orientation of skin lesion along skin creases. Other important distinguishing characteristics include the presence of inflammatory satellite papules, subcutaneous induration beneath lesion, ulcerations with well-defined indurated borders, and presence of subcutaneous nodules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leishmaniasis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Epidemiologic clues that may suggest leishmaniasis include that most individuals with leishmaniasis are otherwise healthy, cases may cluster (several individuals in an exposed group may have skin lesions), some patients recall small insect bites, exposure is usually in rural areas dusk to dawn during the warmer months, risk is usually recent travel or residence in leishmaniasis-endemic regions, and incubation period is typically several weeks to a few months.</p><p>Minor trauma with exposure to brackish water suggests <em>M. marinum</em>. Persistent pruritus is consistent with the chronic sequelae of insect bites. Initial minor skin trauma on extremities in gardeners or farmers is suggestive of sporotrichosis. Animal-to-human transmission of sporotrichosis can occur via chronic ulcerative lesions. Wood cutters with no footwear in tropical forests with high rainfall in South America and Madagascar are at risk for chromoblastomycosis. Immunocompromised hosts may have cutaneous tuberculosis or rapid-growing nontuberculous mycobacterial skin lesions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83446505\"><span class=\"h2\">Leishmaniasis recidivans</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LR refers to a relatively uncommon syndrome caused by <em>L.L. tropica</em> infection. Following healing of the primary lesion, persistent organisms can cause new papules to form around the margin of the scar. Skin biopsy demonstrates few parasites but a robust granulomatous, cell-mediated immune response. LR can occur following trauma in the area of a prior lesion many years after initial healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leishmaniasis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83446520\"><span class=\"h2\">Diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DCL is a rare syndrome that occurs mainly in the setting of <em>L.L. aethiopica</em>, <em>L.L. mexicana</em>, and <em>L.L. amazonensis</em> infection. It begins as a localized lesion that does not ulcerate; rather, amastigotes disseminate to macrophages in other areas of the skin. In general, soft nodules or plaques form on the face and extensor limb surfaces, but the entire body may be involved. Histologically, many parasites are seen, but there is scarce lymphocytic reaction. Patients with DCL usually have a defect in the cell-mediated immune response and are anergic to <em>Leishmania</em> antigen. DCL reported in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients has involved other parasites species such as <em>L.L. major</em> and <em>L.V. guyanensis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leishmaniasis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Successful treatment of DCL is difficult.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83446528\"><span class=\"h2\">Mucosal leishmaniasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ML, also known as espundia, occurs in the New World and is caused by the <em>Viannia </em>subgenus, especially <em>L.V. braziliensis</em>, <em>L.V. guyanensis</em>, and <em>L.V. panamensis</em>, but also <em>L.L. amazonensis </em>(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F110869\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110869 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leishmaniasis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. ML due to Old World species <em>L.L. infantum</em> and <em>L.L. aethiopica</em> has been described among immunocompromised hosts (see <a href=\"#H83446544\" class=\"local\">'CL in immunocompromised hosts'</a> below). Rarely, <em>L.L. tropica</em>, <em>L.L. major</em>, and <em>L.L. infantum-chagasi</em> mucosal leishmaniasis are reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leishmaniasis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The risk of ML due to <em>L.V. braziliensis</em> infection is higher in South America (particularly Bolivia, Peru, and Brazil) than in Central America, specifically north of Costa Rica. Overall, the risk of mucosal disease following a primary CL lesion is less than 5 percent. ML can occur concurrently or following partially treated or untreated CL. Concurrent ML has been described in up to 28 percent of cases; subsequent ML can occur up to 10 years or more following CL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leishmaniasis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>ML is characterized by mucosal destruction. Symptoms include nasal stuffiness or blockage, mucosal bleeding, increased secretions, and sloughing of dead tissue. Some have pain, deformity, and inflammation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F86914\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86914 \">picture 4</a>). Erosion of mucosal surfaces occurs, most commonly in the nose, mouth, or nasal septum (eg, in the form of cartilage perforation). Other involved areas may include the cheek, pharynx, palate, epiglottis, larynx, trachea, and genitalia. Hoarseness <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a brassy cough are suggestive of laryngeal involvement. The disease is considered mild in the setting of isolated nasal stuffiness, moderate if there is associated odynophagia or dysphonia, and severe if there is respiratory distress or severe dysphonia.</p><p>Substantial disfigurement can result from destruction of the nasal cartilage and surrounding tissues. Rarely, aspiration, respiratory compromise, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> death can occur. Any patient with New World CL (<em>Viannia</em> subgenus) regardless of nasal, oral, or hypopharyngeal symptoms should undergo visual inspection of all mucosal surfaces of the hypopharynx, including the vocal cords and oronasal pharynx. Abnormal-appearing tissue should be biopsied, and histopathology as well as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for <em>Leishmania</em> should be performed.</p><p>Histopathology generally demonstrates a robust cell-mediated immune response, and large quantities of cytokine production, T lymphocyte proliferation, and neutrophils expressing proteinases have been observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leishmaniasis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In general, relatively few parasites are observed in mucosal lesions.</p><p><em>Leishmania</em> RNA virus 1 (LRV1), an endosymbiont of <em>L.V. guyanensis</em> and some <em>L.V. braziliensis</em> organisms, may augment infection and may also be associated with metastatic involvement. It acts as an immunogen and elicits a hyperinflammatory immune response through toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leishmaniasis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83446544\"><span class=\"h2\">CL in immunocompromised hosts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Control of intracellular <em>Leishmania</em> infection requires a Th1-dependent cell-mediated immune response including cells (CD4 and CD8 T cells, natural killer, dendritic cells, macrophages) and cytokines (interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-12).</p><p>Patients with immunosuppressing conditions are at increased risk for more severe CL.

Definitive diagnosis requires demonstration of the parasite in a clinical specimen (usually skin) by histology, culture, or molecular analysis via polymerase chain reaction (PCR). To maximize diagnostic yield, ideally all three diagnostic tests are warranted on the initial sample if feasible. If not all tests can be performed, then histology and PCR may provide sufficient information. Parasitologic diagnosis to the level of the <em>Leishmania</em> species should be pursued, since this information may influence determination of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leishmaniasis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Reference laboratory support is available; laboratories should be contacted before diagnostic samples are obtained to obtain instructions and transport media.

Molecular amplification assays are the most sensitive tests available for diagnosis of CL (see <a href=\"#H83446605\" class=\"local\">'Molecular techniques'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83446574\"><span class=\"h3\">Histopathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <em>Leishmania</em> amastigote is an oval to round organism 1.5 to 4.0 microns in diameter with a distinct cell membrane, cytoplasm, internal nucleus, and rod-shaped kinetoplast containing mitochondrial DNA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F86989\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86989 \">picture 5</a>). Visualization of the kinetoplast is essential for a histologic diagnosis. This may require viewing several different sections in fixed tissue samples. Giemsa staining is typically used; with this stain, the cytoplasm is blue, the nucleus violet-blue, and the kinetoplast red to violet (a critical diagnostic characteristic). These findings may be observed on histology or touch prep smears.</p><p>A tissue Gram stain can be useful to highlight the kinetoplast in tissue samples, although hematoxylin and eosin staining is usually sufficient. Under oil immersion (100x), the parasites are found in macrophages in the upper dermis and are often surrounded by dermal chronic inflammation with lymphocytes, macrophages, plasma cells, and sometimes necrotizing granulomas. Organisms may be scarce in chronic lesions such as leishmaniasis recidivans (LR) and <em>L.V. braziliensis</em> infections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83446586\"><span class=\"h3\">Culture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In appropriate culture media, tissue amastigotes may be converted to promastigotes. In one study including 202 skin lesions comparing diagnostic methods for CL in Peru, culture and smear were less useful for skin lesions of a duration &lt;3 months or &gt;12 months or for nonulcerative lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leishmaniasis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Typical liquid media consists of Schneider&rsquo;s drosophila media supplemented with calf serum, or Novy, MacNeal, Nicolle (NNN) media. <em>Leishmania</em> grows best at 26&deg;C; the rate of growth depends on the number of parasites in the tissue, species growth characteristics, and absence of secondary bacterial contamination from the skin (which can overgrow the culture).</p><p>Expansion of the parasite in culture permits speciation using isoenzyme electrophoretic patterns or molecular techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leishmaniasis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Direct staining of cultured parasites or tissues with monoclonal antibodies can also be performed in some laboratories. These methods are slow since they require growth of the promastigote <em>Leishmania</em> form, and therefore species identification is not always available in a clinically useful timeframe. Matrix-assisted laser <span class=\"nowrap\">desorption/ionization</span> (MALDI) is a more rapid method that correlates well with conventional multilocus sequence typing, but it still requires an initial parasite expansion in culture step [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leishmaniasis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Culture for acid-fast bacilli and fungi may also be pursued to evaluate potential alternative diagnoses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83446605\"><span class=\"h3\">Molecular techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Polymerase chain reaction is one of the most sensitive diagnostic tests for CL.

It is important to note that PCR targets and assays vary. In one study including 202 skin lesions comparing diagnostic methods for CL in Peru, PCR had the greatest sensitivity irrespective of lesion characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leishmaniasis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. False-negative results can occur due to technical issues or inhibitors in the sample.</p><p>The sensitivity and specificity of the SMART Leish PCR for the genus assay are 99 and 67 percent, respectively. The genus real-time PCR (RT-PCR) can detect at least four genome copies of <em>Leishmania </em>DNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leishmaniasis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The sensitivity and specificity of the SMART Leish-<em>L. major</em> assay for the species assay are 95 and 91 percent, respectively.

Mucosal leishmaniasis (ML) and leishmaniasis recidivans (LR) are caused by oligoparasitic disease associated with a marked cellular immune response. Diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis (DCL) is caused by polyparasitic disease with a predominance of parasitized macrophages and no granulomatous inflammation. The center of the spectrum consists of localized cutaneous leishmaniasis (LCL), which is the most common clinical presentation. (See <a href=\"#H83446472\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LCL consists of cutaneous lesions on exposed areas of the skin. It begins as a pink-colored papule that enlarges and develops into a nodule or plaque-like lesion (often with central softening), leading to a painless ulceration with an indurated border (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F64620\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64620 \">picture 1</a>). In Old World cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), the ulcer is often covered with a hyperkeratotic eschar (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F87207\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87207 \">picture 2</a>). In New World CL, the ulcer may be covered with thick white-yellow fibrinous material (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F86992\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86992 \">picture 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H83446480\" class=\"local\">'Localized cutaneous leishmaniasis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with immunosuppressing conditions are at increased risk for more severe CL. These groups include patients on chronic corticosteroids, biologic modulators, or other immunosuppressive drugs, organ transplant recipients, pregnant patients, and patients with human immunodeficiency virus <span class=\"nowrap\">(HIV)/acquired</span> immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). (See <a href=\"#H83446544\" class=\"local\">'CL in immunocompromised hosts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of CL should be considered in patients with one or more chronic, usually painless, skin lesions and a history of exposure in an area where leishmaniasis is endemic. Definitive diagnosis requires demonstration of the parasite in a clinical specimen (usually skin) by histology, culture, or molecular analysis via polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Parasitologic diagnosis to the level of the <em>Leishmania</em> species should be pursued if feasible, since this information may influence determination of treatment.
