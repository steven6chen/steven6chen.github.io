The magnitude of the risk depends upon the type of liver disease and its severity, the surgical procedure, and the type of anesthesia.</p><p>The assessment of surgical risk in patients with liver disease will be reviewed here. Patients with liver disease may have concomitant disorders (such as cardiovascular disease) that influence surgical outcomes; these issues are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preoperative medical evaluation of the adult healthy patient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING FOR LIVER DISEASE BEFORE SURGERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients undergoing surgery should undergo a history and physical examination to exclude findings of or risk factors for liver disease. This may include asking about prior blood transfusions, tattoos, illicit drug use, sexual promiscuity, a family history of jaundice or liver disease, a history of jaundice or fever following anesthesia, alcohol use (current, prior and quantity), and a complete review of current medications. Clinical features suggestive of liver disease (such as fatigue, pruritus, increased abdominal girth, jaundice, palmar erythema, spider telangiectasias, splenomegaly, and gynecomastia and testicular atrophy in men) should be evaluated.</p><p>The vast majority of patients found to have abnormal liver biochemical test results do not have advanced liver disease. Thus, it is unlikely that routinely obtaining a liver biochemical profile in otherwise healthy patients without risk factors for liver disease would lead to improved outcomes; thus, such testing is <strong>not</strong> recommended. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preoperative medical evaluation of the adult healthy patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECTS OF ANESTHESIA AND SURGERY ON THE LIVER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effects of anesthesia and surgery on the liver depend upon the type of anesthesia used, the specific surgical procedures, and the severity of liver disease. In addition, perioperative events, such as hypotension, sepsis, or the administration of hepatotoxic drugs, can compound injury to the liver occurring during the procedure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-the-patient-with-liver-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for the patient with liver disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ESTIMATING SURGICAL RISK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessment of surgical risk in patients with liver disease includes an appraisal of the severity of liver disease, the urgency of surgery (and alternatives to surgery), and coexisting medical illness. Surgical risk assessment is less relevant if immediate surgery is required to prevent death. On the other hand, the vast majority of decisions are made in the setting of semi-urgent or elective procedures for which there is time for risk assessment, optimization of the patient's medical status, and consideration of alternative approaches.</p><p>The majority of studies examining the risk of surgery in patients with liver disease have focused on patients with cirrhosis, for which a number of risk factors have been identified (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F61787\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61787 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-surgical-risk-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/6-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-18</a>]. Much less information has been published on the risk of surgery in patients with less advanced forms of liver disease. The available evidence is derived mostly from small retrospective studies and clinical experience. Furthermore, many of the studies were published prior to the availability of a number of serologic tests for specific types of liver disease and modern hepatobiliary imaging. Thus, there is relatively little information on the risk of surgery in patients with some specific types of liver disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients in whom surgery is contraindicated</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of settings have been identified that are associated with unacceptable surgical mortality. As a result, these conditions are usually considered to be contraindications to elective surgery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F64509\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64509 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute or fulminant hepatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute hepatitis is a contraindication to elective surgery. This recommendation is based upon older studies, in which operative mortality rates of 10 to 13 percent were reported among icteric patients who underwent laparotomy as part of a diagnostic evaluation that ultimately led to a diagnosis of acute viral hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-surgical-risk-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Similarly, patients with fulminant hepatitis are gravely ill and are unlikely to withstand surgery other than liver transplantation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-liver-failure-in-adults-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute liver failure in adults: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Alcoholic hepatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elective surgery is contraindicated in patients with histologic evidence of alcoholic hepatitis. Mortality rates as high as 55 to 100 percent have been observed in such patients undergoing open liver biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-surgical-risk-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], portosystemic shunt surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-surgical-risk-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>], or exploratory laparotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-surgical-risk-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of alcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic cirrhosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, it is possible that advances in surgical technique and postoperative care may have improved the outcome in such patients compared with the above studies, some of which were conducted between the 1960s and 1980s. This was illustrated in a report from 1984, in which operative liver biopsy findings were reviewed in 164 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and bleeding varices who underwent emergency portacaval shunt surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-surgical-risk-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Of these patients, 49 (30 percent) had histologic evidence of alcoholic hepatitis but had survival rates similar to those without alcoholic hepatitis. These results have not been duplicated.</p><p>We recommend that elective surgery should be delayed for at least 12 weeks or that a repeat liver biopsy should be considered to confirm resolution. The severity of underlying liver disease should be reassessed prior to making a final recommendation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Severe chronic hepatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical risk in patients with chronic hepatitis correlates with the clinical, biochemical, and histologic severity of disease. Patients with symptomatic and histologically severe chronic hepatitis have increased surgical risk, particularly in those with impaired hepatic synthetic or excretory function, portal hypertension, or bridging or multilobular necrosis on liver biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-surgical-risk-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients at variable increased risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of surgery in patients with cirrhosis depends upon the severity of disease, the clinical setting, and type of surgical procedure. For over 30 years, the principal predictor of operative risk in patients with cirrhosis was the Child-Turcotte-Pugh score or Child-Pugh (CP) class, but more recent studies suggest that the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score may be superior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-surgical-risk-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Child-Pugh classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of retrospective studies have demonstrated that perioperative mortality and morbidity in patients with cirrhosis correlate well with the Child-Turcotte (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F56436\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56436 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-surgical-risk-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] and the CP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78401 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-surgical-risk-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/18,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,30</a>] classifications of cirrhosis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study from 1984, perioperative mortality rates of 10, 31, and 76 percent were observed in 100 patients with predominantly alcoholic cirrhosis undergoing abdominal surgery who were CP class A, B, and C, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-surgical-risk-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

However, many of the patients underwent laparoscopic surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-surgical-risk-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 138 patients undergoing intra-abdominal or abdominal wall surgery published in 2011 showed rates of 10, 17, and 63 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-surgical-risk-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p/><p>Mortality rates declined in the 2000s, presumably because of improvements in the overall care of critically ill patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-surgical-risk-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>In a retrospective study of 261 patients (45 with cirrhosis and 216 matched controls without cirrhosis) undergoing cardiac surgery between 1992 and 2009, patients with a CP score of less than 8 had a higher survival rate at 90 days compared with patients whose score was 8 or greater (95 versus 30 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-surgical-risk-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In addition, patients with a CP score of less than 8 had survival rates similar to those of control patients without cirrhosis (95 versus 97 percent).</p><p>Patients with CP class A cirrhosis and portal hypertension are at increased risk of postoperative ascites, jaundice, and encephalopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-surgical-risk-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Limited observations suggest that postoperative morbidity may be reduced by preoperative placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-surgical-risk-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Measures of hepatic function and the APACHE score</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of measures of hepatic function have been proposed as predictors of perioperative morbidity and mortality in patients with cirrhosis. Examples include quantitative assessment of liver function with dynamic tests such as galactose elimination capacity, aminopyrine breath testing, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indocyanine-green-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indocyanine green</a> clearance, and the rate of metabolism of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> to monoethylglycinexylidide (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tests-of-the-livers-biosynthetic-capacity-eg-albumin-coagulation-factors-prothrombin-time\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tests of the liver's biosynthetic capacity (eg, albumin, coagulation factors, prothrombin time)&quot;</a>). However, none has been shown convincingly to provide additional prognostic information compared with the CP classification, and, as a result, they are not used widely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-surgical-risk-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>The Acute Physiology, Age, and Chronic Health Evaluation System (APACHE III) score can predict survival in cirrhotic patients admitted to an intensive care unit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-surgical-risk-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

It has been evaluated principally for selecting patients for liver transplantation. Use of this model for predicting surgical risk in the nontransplant setting has been promising and thus it is supplanting the CP classification as the principal method for determining surgical risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-surgical-risk-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/39-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-44</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Optimizing medical therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Operative mortality can be estimated based upon the Child-Pugh classification (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78401 \">table 4</a>) and the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-mortality-risk-in-postoperative-patients-with-cirrhosis\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 3</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-mortality-risk-in-postoperative-patients-with-cirrhosis-si-units\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 4</a>) taking into consideration other factors such as the patient's age, ASA score, and additional comorbidities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that elective or semi-urgent surgery <strong>not</strong> be performed in patients with acute or fulminant hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, severe chronic hepatitis, Child-Pugh class C or MELD score &gt;15 cirrhosis, severe coagulopathy, or severe extrahepatic manifestations of liver disease (such as hypoxia, cardiomyopathy, or acute renal failure) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).</p><p/><p>For other patients, the risk of surgery should be considered individually depending upon the clinical setting and the type of procedure:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery is generally well tolerated in patients with cirrhosis and Child-Pugh class A or MELD score &lt;10 and those with mild chronic liver disease without cirrhosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery is generally permissible in patients with cirrhosis and Child-Pugh class B or MELD score 10 to 15 (except those undergoing extensive hepatic resection or cardiac surgery) who have undergone thorough preoperative preparation.</p><p/><p>Consideration should also be given as to whether surgery can be deferred until after liver transplantation (either orthotopic or live donor) in appropriate candidates.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-surgical-risk-in-patients-with-liver-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Friedman LS.
