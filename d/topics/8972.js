HL tends to arise within lymph node areas and to spread in an orderly fashion to contiguous areas of lymph nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-iii-iv-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Once the diagnosis of HL has been established, subsequent therapy is based upon the stage of the disease, as currently defined by the Cotswolds classification (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F66651\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66651 \">table 1</a>).

Response to therapy is assessed by positron emission tomography (PET) after two cycles of chemotherapy (PET2). A full course of ABVD treatment is six versus eight cycles based on PET2 results and, as such, the total time of chemotherapy ranges from 24 to 32 weeks. Adverse events include cytopenias, <span class=\"nowrap\">nausea/vomiting,</span> neuropathy, and bleomycin-associated pulmonary toxicity, and long-term toxicities include cardiopulmonary toxicity and second cancers.

A+AVD is repeated every 14 days in 28-day cycles, and two treatments are considered one cycle. Patients receive six to eight cycles of chemotherapy, based on results of PET2, and treatment ranges from 24 to 32 weeks. Acute adverse events include cytopenias, and peripheral neuropathy; long-term toxicities are less well defined. (See <a href=\"#H4192474510\" class=\"local\">'A+AVD'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BEACOPP (standard <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> escalated) is being increasingly used worldwide and may have particular utility in patients with a high international prognostic score (eg, IPS of 4 or greater). BEACOPP is administered on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle with scheduled growth factor support for a total time of chemotherapy ranging from 18 to 24 weeks. Eight cycles of escalated BEACOPP was initially shown to be superior to standard (baseline) BEACOPP or <span class=\"nowrap\">COPP/ABVD</span>. Six cycles of escalated BEACOPP may be more effective and less toxic. Alternatively, four cycles of escalated BEACOPP may be followed by four cycles of either escalated or standard-dose BEACOPP, depending upon the response to the first four cycles. When compared with ABVD, BEACOPP is associated with higher rates of toxicity including reversible bone marrow suppression, secondary malignancies, and sterility. Toxicities are particularly severe in the elderly, making it most appropriate for younger patients (&lt;50 years) with high-risk disease. It is unknown how BEACOPP affects the ability to provide effective salvage therapy, such as autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation, to patients who relapse. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'BEACOPP chemotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stanford V is a combined modality treatment that incorporates radiation therapy (RT) for the great majority of patients. Chemotherapy is administered weekly for a total of 12 weeks. RT is initiated one to three weeks after the completion of chemotherapy and delivered to all sites of disease 5 cm or larger at diagnosis and to areas of macroscopic splenic involvement. The main toxicities are neutropenia and constipation. No cases of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a> lung toxicity, radiation pneumonitis, secondary leukemia or lymphoma have been reported. Fertility appears to be preserved. While randomized studies have failed to show any superiority over ABVD, this regimen remains an option for those patients without high-risk features who would be expected to benefit from the addition of RT regardless of the chemotherapy regimen chosen, or for patients for whom lower doses of bleomycin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a> or a shorter length of treatment are important considerations. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Stanford V'</a> below and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Is there a role for radiation?'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>For most patients with advanced stage HL, we suggest treatment with ABVD, although Stanford V and BEACOPP are reasonable alternatives, as discussed below. Stanford V may be chosen because of its short administration schedule (12 versus 24 to 32 weeks with ABVD), decreased pulmonary toxicity (total <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a> dose is 25 percent of six cycles of ABVD) and reduced dosing of anthracycline (total <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a> dose is 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> versus 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> for six cycles of ABVD). Escalated BEACOPP is an increasingly common choice. The greatest potential benefit when compared with <span class=\"nowrap\">COPP/ABVD</span> was seen in those patients with an IPS of 4 or greater, despite increased side effects. Indirect evidence also suggests that escalated BEACOPP results in superior survival at five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-iii-iv-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. It is unknown whether this advantage will be lost over longer follow-up due to an increase in second malignancies and cardiac toxicity, which account for the majority of late deaths. Details on the efficacy and toxicities associated with these regimens are presented in detail in the sections that follow.</p><p>The antibody-drug conjugate <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brentuximab-vedotin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">brentuximab vedotin</a> (BV; anti-CD30 antibody complexed with monomethyl auristatin E) was effective and well-tolerated when combined with AVD (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinblastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinblastine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dacarbazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dacarbazine</a>) in a phase 1 study of initial treatment of advanced stage HL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-iii-iv-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. After more than five years of follow-up, treatment of 26 patients with BV plus AVD achieved 92 percent failure-free survival and 100 percent overall survival. No unexpected toxicities were detected and the two patients who relapsed achieved a second remission. Importantly, addition of BV to ABVD caused excessive pulmonary toxicity that was not seen when BV was combined with AVD. A phase III study is underway to test BV plus AVD versus ABVD. Additional details regarding BV are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma#H3990798595\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Brentuximab vedotin'</a>.)</p><p>Despite the increasing availability of guidelines for the treatment of HL, there must remain room for individualization of treatment. In particular, patient preference must be considered with different treatment options, some of which result in a higher recurrence risk at the gain of less toxic initial treatment. Treatment should also be individualized when a particular approach might result in a higher risk of acute <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> late complications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2614629280\"><span class=\"h3\">Response adapted therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Checking a positron emission tomography with computed tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET/CT)</span> mid-treatment is controversial, but it is often done in clinical practice. Mid-treatment imaging has prognostic value, and initial studies suggest that treatment de-escalation may be safe in early responders. There are limited data regarding the efficacy of treatment escalation in those without an early response. <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT-response</span> adapted therapy will be discussed here. The prognostic value of mid-treatment <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=monitoring-of-the-patient-with-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-during-and-after-treatment#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Monitoring of the patient with classical Hodgkin lymphoma during and after treatment&quot;, section on 'Radiologic studies'</a>.)</p><p>The application of mid-treatment <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> is complicated and must take into account pre-treatment <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> results, the initial therapy given, the timing of the mid-treatment scan, the method used for PET interpretation, and the cutoff value used. When applying this method to clinical practice, it is important to closely follow the methods used in the trials demonstrating efficacy.</p><p>The safety of treatment de-escalation in those with an early response on mid-treatment <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> was evaluated in a randomized trial of 1214 patients with advanced stage HL defined as those with stage IIB to IV disease or stage IIA with adverse features (bulky disease or at least three involved sites) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-iii-iv-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Patients with unfavorable stage II disease comprised 42 percent of the study population. <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> was performed at baseline and 9 to 13 days after the second cycle of ABVD. PET findings were scored using the Deauville 5-point score. The 935 patients with a mid-treatment PET score of 1, 2, or 3 were randomly assigned to receive four more cycles of ABVD or four cycles of AVD. Consolidation radiotherapy was left to the treating clinician's discretion and was administered to 2.6 and 4.3 percent of those receiving ABVD and AVD, respectively. After a median follow-up of 41 months, AVD and ABVD resulted in similar rates of progression-free survival (PFS; 84 versus 86 percent) and overall survival (OS; 98 versus 97 percent) at three years. While the absolute difference in PFS was 1.6 percentage points, the 95 percent confidence interval ranged from a 3.2 percent improvement to a 5.3 percent decline.</p><p>These results suggest that patients who attain a PET score of 1, 2, or 3 after two cycles of ABVD may reasonably complete therapy with four additional cycles of AVD without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a>. The decision for an individual patient must take into account the risk of pulmonary toxicity with further bleomycin versus the potentially small increase in relapse with bleomycin omission. While this approach is an option for all patients with advanced stage HL, it is most attractive for those with additional risk factors for bleomycin toxicity (eg, older age, underlying pulmonary disease, active smokers). Younger patients who wish to minimize their chance of relapse may choose to complete therapy with four more cycles of ABVD.</p><p>There is a paucity of data regarding the preferred approach for patients with a PET score of 4 or 5 after two cycles of ABVD. Outside of a clinical trial, many clinicians will continue with ABVD therapy with modifications based on further imaging <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> biopsy samples. Nonrandomized trials have evaluated treatment escalation in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-iii-iv-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. As an example, in the trial described above, the 172 patients with a PET score of 4 or 5 were nonrandomly assigned to BEACOPP with estimated PFS and OS rates at three years of 68 and 88 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-iii-iv-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. While these results are better than those seen in historical controls, randomized trials are necessary to determine whether escalation of therapy is superior to completion of ABVD with escalation in those with residual disease at the end of six to eight cycles.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">ABVD chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ABVD (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinblastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinblastine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dacarbazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dacarbazine</a>) was originally developed for patients with disease resistant to MOPP (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechlorethamine-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mechlorethamine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procarbazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procarbazine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>), but subsequently became the standard initial chemotherapy for patients with HL (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F74186\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74186 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-iii-iv-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

As such, the total time of chemotherapy ranges from 24 to 32 weeks.

Up to 20 percent (higher rates with baseline BEACOPP than escalated BEACOPP) will have disease progression by five-years and will require further therapy.

When compared with ABVD, BEACOPP provides better initial tumor control, but no difference in event-free survival or OS when relapsed or refractory disease is managed with high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell support.</p><p>Several randomized trials have compared BEACOPP with ABVD-based therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-iii-iv-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/17,34,35,37-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,34,35,37-43</a>]. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that BEACOPP is associated with higher response rates and better rates of PFS than those seen with ABVD, but no improvement in OS. This was best illustrated in a 2011 meta-analysis that included data from four randomized trials with a total of 2868 adult patients with newly diagnosed advanced stage or unfavorable early stage HL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-iii-iv-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

BEACOPP was associated with significantly more severe hematologic toxicity, infections, and occurrence of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia.</p><p>It appears that the degree of the PFS benefit may be greatest among the highest risk patients. However, this comes at the cost of increased toxicity with no clear improvement in OS when compared with ABVD alone. Initial treatment with BEACOPP exposes approximately 73 percent of patients with advanced stage HL (those cured by ABVD) to excess toxicity that may include such effects as sterility and secondary malignancies. In comparison, initial treatment with ABVD avoids these toxicities in the majority of patients, but requires that approximately one in eight patients proceed to high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue at progression, a treatment with potential complications of acute toxic effects, sterility, and secondary malignancies. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'BEACOPP toxicities'</a> below.)</p><p>Reducing the number of escalated BEACOPP treatment cycles from eight to six results in superior efficacy and less toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-iii-iv-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. There have been no direct comparisons of six cycles of escalated BEACOPP with ABVD. A network meta-analysis of 14 trials with a total of 9993 patients with advanced stage HL followed for a median of 5.9 years suggested that, when compared with ABVD, six cycles of escalated BEACOPP resulted in superior OS at five years (95 versus 88 percent; hazard ratio 0.38, 95% CI 0.20-0.75) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-iii-iv-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. There were no direct comparisons between these two treatment options, and 711 and 1670 patients had received six cycles of escalated BEACOPP and ABVD, respectively.

Involved site radiation therapy (ISRT) is preferred over larger radiation fields. ISRT is based on the initial involved volume in the treated site and reduced in consideration of the node regression after chemotherapy such that most uninvolved normal organs are spared of radiation.

Older adults have accounted for a minority of patients included in randomized trials and they are more likely to have comorbidities that can limit treatment options and increase the risk of toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-iii-iv-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/99-103\" class=\"abstract_t\">99-103</a>]. However, older adults should be offered curative therapy such as that used for younger adults whenever possible. The amount of chemotherapy administered in the initial treatment of HL affects overall survival.</p><p>For most older adults with HL treated outside of a clinical trial, we suggest treatment with ABVD (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinblastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinblastine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dacarbazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dacarbazine</a>) rather than Stanford V or BEACOPP. This is primarily based on the larger general experience with ABVD across all populations, increased toxicity with more intensive therapy, and lack of a survival benefit with Stanford V.</p><p>There are increasing data that older patients are particularly vulnerable to the toxicity of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a>, which can be severe. Some have advocated omitting bleomycin in older patients to minimize pulmonary toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-iii-iv-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]; however, it is unknown whether the routine omission of bleomycin in ABVD compromises cure rates. Studies in early stage disease have demonstrated higher rates of treatment failure when bleomycin is omitted from ABVD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-iii-iv-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. Randomized trials have also shown that the omission of bleomycin reduces the rate of pulmonary toxicity among older adults receiving four cycles of chemotherapy, but not among those receiving two cycles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-iii-iv-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. Prospective studies are evaluating novel approaches that omit bleomycin (eg, substituting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brentuximab-vedotin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">brentuximab vedotin</a> for bleomycin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-iii-iv-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>]). Use of such regimens should be restricted to the clinical trial setting. Importantly, adding brentuximab vedotin without omitting bleomycin results in unacceptably high rates of potentially fatal pulmonary toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-iii-iv-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>]. </p><p>Outside of a clinical trial, we believe that most older adults should be initially treated with the same dosing and schedule of ABVD as younger adults with adjustments made to future cycles according to tolerance and imaging. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Bleomycin</a> is not routinely omitted or dose-reduced. Instead, we monitor pulmonary function closely (eg, pulmonary function tests after two cycles) and omit bleomycin from subsequent cycles in patients who develop symptomatic or asymptomatic bleomycin-induced pulmonary toxicity during treatment. In addition, we often omit bleomycin from subsequent cycles in those attaining a PET score of 1, 2, or 3 after two cycles of ABVD as described above. (See <a href=\"#H2614629280\" class=\"local\">'Response adapted therapy'</a> above.)</p><p>While we don't routinely omit <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a> from the outset in this setting, a decision to do so can be made on an individual basis considering the risk of toxicity and potential for cure. We occasionally omit bleomycin on an individual basis in the extreme elderly (ie, those greater than age 80 years), the very frail, those unlikely to be cured, and those with high-risk comorbidities (eg, underlying pulmonary disease, active smokers) in whom the risks and ability to tolerate even early detected bleomycin toxicity may outweigh the benefit. </p><p>In a retrospective analysis of 147 older adults (&ge;60 years) treated with ABVD for newly diagnosed HL of all stages, 117 (80 percent) achieved a complete remission and the estimated overall survival rate at five years was 67 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-iii-iv-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. Toxicity necessitated changes to the treatment <span class=\"nowrap\">schedule/dose</span> in 48 patients. Severe (grade <span class=\"nowrap\">3/4)</span> toxicity occurred in 63 patients (43 percent) and included pulmonary toxicity (26 percent), hematologic toxicity (10 percent), and infection (3 percent). There were 15 treatment-related deaths, including seven deaths due to pulmonary toxicity. Pulmonary toxicity developed at a median of five months from the first cycle and was not clearly predicted by clinical features (eg, underlying lung disease, tobacco history, age, radiotherapy, or G-CSF use). This study emphasizes the potential curability of HL in older adults and the need for close monitoring during therapy.</p><p>In contrast, BEACOPP has been associated with unacceptable toxicities in patients over the age of 60.

Such considerations must weigh short- and long-term outcomes and toxicities. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The number of cycles of ABVD chemotherapy is informed by the response on positron emission tomography (PET) scan after two treatment cycles (PET2; ie, response adapted therapy). Patients who attain a PET2 score of 1, 2, or 3 (&quot;PET2-negative&quot;) may reasonably complete therapy with four additional cycles of AVD (without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a>). The decision for an individual patient must take into account the risk of pulmonary toxicity with further bleomycin versus the potentially small increase in relapse with bleomycin omission. This approach is most attractive for those at high risk for bleomycin toxicity (eg, older age, underlying pulmonary disease, active smokers). Younger patients who wish to minimize their chance of relapse may choose to complete therapy with four more cycles of ABVD. (See <a href=\"#H2614629280\" class=\"local\">'Response adapted therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The role of consolidation radiotherapy (RT) after chemotherapy induction for advanced stage HL is controversial. RT appears to improve freedom from progression but not overall survival. Its use depends primarily upon the initial chemotherapy administered and the patient's response to that chemotherapy. RT is a key component of the Stanford V protocol. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'General'</a> above and <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'With Stanford V'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The decision to proceed with adjuvant radiation after ABVD must be individualized. Factors to be taken into account when making this decision include the patient's age, sex, history of prior radiation, and the size and location of the proposed radiation field. In general, we use the following approach:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with advanced stage HL and initial bulky mediastinal disease (&gt;10 cm or <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;1/3</span> the chest diameter), we suggest the use of consolidation involved site RT after ABVD rather than observation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The radiation dose is usually 30 to 36 Gy, and depends upon field size, initial disease volume, and response to chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'After ABVD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with nonbulky advanced stage HL who achieve a complete remission with ABVD, we suggest observation rather than the use of consolidation RT (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients treated with ABVD who achieve a partial response, with residual PET abnormalities, should undergo biopsy of the suspected residual disease. If the biopsy demonstrates residual disease, additional therapy is administered as appropriate for <span class=\"nowrap\">relapsed/refractory</span> disease. Alternatively, consolidation with RT or close observation with short interval follow-up may be chosen in select circumstances in which a biopsy may prove difficult or dangerous or when PET residual abnormality is of borderline significance.</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-iii-iv-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Mauch PM, Kalish LA, Kadin M, et al.
