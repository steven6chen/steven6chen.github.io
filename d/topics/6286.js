As such, the stage groupings do not serve as a guide for choosing local therapy. A modification to the tumor staging system for perihilar tumors has been proposed that incorporates the Bismuth-Corlette classification and a more detailed assessment of major vascular invasion, as well as liver remnant volume and underlying liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-classification-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cholangiocarcinomas account for approximately 3 percent of all gastrointestinal malignancies, with a prevalence in autopsy studies of 0.01 to 0.46 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-classification-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The reported incidence in the United States is one or two cases per 100,000 population.</p><p>Incidence data from the American Cancer Society are difficult to interpret because intrahepatic bile duct cancers are included with primary liver cancers, while extrahepatic biliary cancers are in a separate category that includes gallbladder cancer. In the United States an estimated 42,220 primary liver and intrahepatic bile duct cancers are diagnosed annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-classification-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Data from the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program suggest that approximately 15 percent of these are intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-classification-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>Approximately 12,190 cases of extrahepatic biliary tract cancers are diagnosed annually in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-classification-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], two-thirds of which are gallbladder cancers. The remainder, approximately 3000 cases per year, are extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas.</p><p>For unclear reasons, the incidence of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma has been rising over the past two decades in Europe, North America, Asia, Japan, and Australia (but not Denmark [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-classification-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]), while rates of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma are declining internationally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-classification-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/11-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-18</a>]. Some of these apparent differences may be due to changes in ICD (International Classification of Disease) classification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-classification-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>In addition, at least some of the increase in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas may be attributable to new diagnostic methods for obstructive jaundice that identify biliary malignancies that previously might have gone undiagnosed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-classification-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, the rising rates of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma have not been associated with an increase in the proportion of early stage or smaller size lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-classification-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Furthermore, incidence rates do not seem to be plateauing. Other studies suggest that the increasing incidence of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma may be related to a concomitant increase in certain risk factors such as cirrhosis, alcoholic liver disease, and hepatitis C virus infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-classification-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> below.) </p><p>The decreased incidence of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas is also unexplained. In one epidemiologic study, the decline in incidence could not be attributed to time trends in known risk factors such as inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, smoking, or exposure to Thorotrast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-classification-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> below.)</p><p>As a general rule, the incidence of biliary tract cancers increases with age; the typical patient with cholangiocarcinoma is between 50 and 70 years of age. However, patients with cholangiocarcinomas arising in the setting of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and those with choledochal cysts present nearly two decades earlier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-classification-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/9,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,22</a>]. In contrast to gallbladder cancer, where female gender predominates, the incidence of cholangiocarcinoma is slightly higher in men. This probably reflects the higher incidence of PSC in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-classification-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary sclerosing cholangitis: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma have been recognized, although a specific risk factor cannot be identified for many patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-classification-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In the United States and Europe, the main risk factors are primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and fibropolycystic liver disease (eg, choledochal cysts). There is a clear and strong association between chronic intrahepatic stone disease (hepatolithiasis, also called recurrent pyogenic cholangitis) and cholangiocarcinoma. Chronic liver disease (cirrhosis and viral infection) is now recognized as a risk factor, particularly for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Finally, at least two genetic conditions, Lynch syndrome and biliary papillomatosis, increase the risk for cholangiocarcinoma. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary sclerosing cholangitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PSC is an inflammatory disorder of the biliary tree that leads to fibrosis and stricturing of the intrahepatic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> extrahepatic bile ducts. PSC is strongly associated with inflammatory bowel disease, notably ulcerative colitis (UC); approximately 40 to 50 percent of patients have symptomatic colitis, while the incidence of colitis is around 90 percent in patients with PSC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-classification-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary sclerosing cholangitis: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is a well-established association between PSC and cholangiocarcinoma, especially perihilar disease. Nearly 30 percent of cholangiocarcinomas are diagnosed in patients with PSC, with or without UC. The annual incidence of cholangiocarcinoma in patients with PSC has been estimated to be between 0.6 and 1.5 percent per year, with a lifetime risk of 5 to 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-classification-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/26-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-32</a>]. However, the incidence is much higher (30 percent or more) in autopsy series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-classification-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Cholangiocarcinomas develop at a significantly younger age (between the ages of 30 and 50) in patients with PSC than in those without this condition. It is also more difficult to diagnose because of the diffusely abnormal biliary tree [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-classification-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Over one-third of cases are diagnosed within two years of the initial diagnosis of PSC, and the risk appears unrelated to the duration of the inflammatory disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-classification-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/22,28,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,28,33</a>]. However, a population-based patient series from the Netherlands has questioned previous notions that late presentation of cholangiocarcinoma is a rare event, reporting that 37 percent of cholangiocarcinomas present more than 10 years after the diagnosis of PSC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-classification-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Thus, clinical and biochemical deterioration at any point in the disease course should prompt evaluation for a potentially malignant cause.

As an example, approximately one-third of tumors overexpress p53 (implying the presence of mutations in this tumor suppressor gene), while abnormal expression of KRAS is found in 45 to 54 percent of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas and 10 to 15 percent of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-classification-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>]. These genetic alterations seem to be associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-classification-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/117,118\" class=\"abstract_t\">117,118</a>].</p><p>The contribution of these genetic changes to cholangiocarcinoma genesis and their relationship to chronic inflammation, ethnic background, and carcinogen exposure remain uncertain (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above). At least some data suggest that p16INK4a promoter point mutations contribute to initiation and progression of cholangiocarcinoma in the setting of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-classification-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/119,120\" class=\"abstract_t\">119,120</a>]. </p><p>Mutations in the gene encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) have been identified in 25 percent of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas and not extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas or gallbladder carcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-classification-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>]. In this study, the frequency of <em>IDH1</em> and <em>IDH2</em> gene mutations was greater than the combined frequency of activating mutations in other genes (<em>AKT1</em>, <em>KRAS</em>, <em>NRAS</em>, and <em>BRAF</em>) in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas. This suggests potential for targeting this pathway in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.</p><p>Although current knowledge is limited, it is hoped that advances in the understanding of the genetic pathways that contribute to the development of cholangiocarcinomas will identify driver mutations that can be successfully targeted for therapeutic benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-classification-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>]. However, at present, there are no molecular markers that are currently used for prognosis or selecting treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25322780\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The term cholangiocarcinoma refers to bile duct cancers arising in the intrahepatic, perihilar, or distal (extrahepatic) biliary tree, exclusive of the gallbladder or ampulla of Vater. Cancers arising in the perihilar region are further classified according to their patterns of involvement of the hepatic ducts (the Bismuth-Corlette classification) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F75886\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75886 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging classification from the joint American Joint Committee on Cancer <span class=\"nowrap\">(AJCC)/Union</span> for International Cancer Control (UICC) includes separate staging systems for intrahepatic, perihilar, and distal bile duct tumors, which differ in their definitions of primary tumor stage and their prognostic stage groupings. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy, tumor classification, and staging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of biliary tract cancer increases with age; the typical patient with cholangiocarcinoma is between 50 and 70 years old. For unclear reasons, the incidence of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma has been rising over the past two decades in Europe, North America, Asia, Japan, and Australia, while rates of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma are declining internationally. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma have been recognized, although a specific risk factor cannot be identified for many patients. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the United States and Europe, the main risk factors are primary sclerosing cholangitis and choledochal cysts (fibropolycystic liver disease). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Primary sclerosing cholangitis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Fibropolycystic liver disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Southeast Asia has a very high incidence of cholangiocarcinoma that is due to a high prevalence of hepatobiliary flukes. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Parasitic infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There is a clear and strong association between chronic intrahepatic stone disease (hepatolithiasis, also called recurrent pyogenic cholangitis) and cholangiocarcinoma. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, and hepatolithiasis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Chronic liver disease (cirrhosis and viral infection) is a risk factor, especially for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At least two genetic disorders are associated with an increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma: Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer) and a rare inherited disorder called multiple biliary papillomatosis. (See <a href=\"#H647555\" class=\"local\">'Genetic disorders: Lynch syndrome and biliary papillomatosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of cholangiocarcinomas (&gt;90 percent) are adenocarcinomas, with squamous cell carcinoma being responsible for most of the remaining cases. Adenocarcinomas are further divided into three types: nodular, sclerosing, and papillary. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Cholangiocarcinoma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Combined hepatocellular-cholangiocellular carcinoma, also referred to as primary liver carcinoma with biphenotypic differentiation, is now acknowledged as a distinct rare subtype of cholangiocarcinoma. Prognosis is intermediate between that of hepatocellular cancer and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. (See <a href=\"#H646656\" class=\"local\">'Combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of molecular defects involving both oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes have been described in specimens of invasive biliary tract tumors. Conversion from normal to malignant bile epithelium through one of these precursor lesions probably requires a stepwise accumulation of successive genetic abnormalities. However, the level of understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of cholangiocarcinoma is significantly less than that of other gastrointestinal cancers. (See <a href=\"#H646983\" class=\"local\">'Molecular pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1611464114\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Nezam H Afdhal, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Nagorney DM, Pawlik TM, Chun YS, et al..
