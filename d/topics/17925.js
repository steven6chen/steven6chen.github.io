It was classified as AML-M3 in the older French-American-British (FAB) classification system, and acute promyelocytic leukemia with t(15;17)(q24.1;q21.1);PML-RARA in the World Health Organization classification system. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of acute myeloid leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The vast majority of patients with newly diagnosed APL obtain a hematologic complete remission (CR) with induction therapy that incorporates <a href=\"topic.htm?path=all-trans-retinoic-acid-systemic-tretinoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">all-trans retinoic acid</a> (ATRA; tretinoin), followed by a molecular CR after consolidation therapy. The predominant cause of induction failure (5 to 10 percent) is death from hemorrhage or infection, and it is extremely uncommon to have primary drug resistance in APL. Despite this, relapse occurs in 10 to 15 percent of patients with APL and in 20 to 30 percent of those with high-risk APL (ie, presentation with a white blood cell count <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;10,000/microL</span> and a platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;40,000/microL)</span>. Some of these relapses have occurred after more than five years in remission. Using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arsenic-trioxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">arsenic trioxide</a> (ATO) during consolidation of first CR may markedly reduce the relapse rate even in high-risk APL.</p><p>The treatment of relapsed or refractory APL will be reviewed here. The clinical features, diagnosis, and prognosis of APL in adults are presented separately, as is the initial treatment of APL.

Response criteria are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=remission-criteria-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia-and-monitoring-for-residual-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Remission criteria in acute myeloid leukemia and monitoring for residual disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We consider patients to have relapsed disease if, after attainment of complete molecular remission, subsequent analyses confirm the loss of such molecular remission or identify extramedullary disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of patients with relapsed APL is generally aimed at achieving remission with plans to proceed to high-dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in those with chemotherapy-sensitive disease. Allogeneic HCT can be considered if a suitable donor is available, but for APL, allogeneic HCT is not clearly better than autologous HCT, at least in patients who achieve a second complete molecular response. For patients who do not achieve RT-PCR negativity, allogeneic HCT is the preferred treatment in eligible patients with an available donor. The treatment of patients who are not candidates for HCT, who fail to respond to second-line regimens, or who relapse after HCT is generally palliative; enrollment onto a clinical trial should be encouraged. The same approach is followed in patients with refractory disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H105092208\"><span class=\"h1\">ACHIEVING A SECOND RESPONSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several treatment regimens have been utilized to treat refractory and relapsed disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=all-trans-retinoic-acid-systemic-tretinoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">all-trans retinoic acid</a> (ATRA), anthracyclines, high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arsenic-trioxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">arsenic trioxide</a> (ATO), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemtuzumab-ozogamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemtuzumab ozogamicin</a>. The choice of therapy and the likelihood of cure depend in part upon whether ATRA was given together with an anthracycline drug during the first remission, whether ATO was incorporated into induction or post-remission therapy, and whether the relapse occurred while the patient was still receiving therapy.</p><p>Long-term follow-up of 380 patients initially treated with ATRA demonstrated that most relapses occur during the first three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Late relapses are not common, accounting for less than 5 percent of relapses, and are likely to have durable responses with second line therapy.</p><p>The molecular pathways involved in relapsed or refractory APL are poorly understood, but likely differ depending upon the type of initial treatment and the timing of relapse in relation to treatment. As an example, in an analysis of 45 patients with relapsed APL following initial treatment with ATRA plus chemotherapy, 18 cases (40 percent) demonstrated point mutations in the ligand binding domain of PML-RARalpha [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Patients with <em>PML-RARA</em> point mutations had progressive disease while receiving ATRA therapy (11 cases) or progressed following the completion of ATRA therapy (seven cases), suggesting selection pressure due to both ATRA therapy and ATRA-independent mechanisms of progression. In contrast, patients within the same study who received ATO as part of their initial therapy had a lower rate of progression, perhaps due to elimination of clones containing <em>PML-RARA</em> point mutations. Another study of patients with relapse after ATO identified point mutations within the B2 domain of <em>PML</em> that interacts with ATO upon binding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Some patients with <em>RARA</em> mutations alone responded to subsequent therapy with ATRA plus ATO, while none with both <em>PML</em> and <em>RARA</em> mutations responded.</p><p>A European registry reported outcomes of 155 patients who were treated with ATO for first relapse of APL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

It is also the treatment of choice for most patients with relapsed APL following initial therapy with ATRA plus chemotherapy. Complete remission (CR) can be obtained in 85 to 88 percent of patients. It is unclear whether adding ATRA to ATO is better than ATO alone. ATO is able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and so can be used in patients with central nervous system involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This therapy is then followed by consolidation treatment, which is selected based upon the depth of response and patient characteristics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a second remission is obtained and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing is negative for the <em><span class=\"nowrap\">PML/RARA</span> </em>transcript, consolidation with either autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), allogeneic HCT, or further ATO is given. Autologous HCT is usually preferred because of its association with less toxicity and morbidity. However, if the patient is young (eg, &lt;30 years of age) and without comorbid conditions, allogeneic HCT is an equally effective choice with a potential, yet unproven improvement in disease control.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If PCR negativity is not obtained, allogeneic HCT is the favored treatment, but alternative treatments such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemtuzumab-ozogamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemtuzumab ozogamicin</a> are acceptable options.</p><p/><p>A number of studies have shown a high response rate following therapy with ATO in patients with relapsed APL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/7-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-13</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A case series included 26 patients with relapsed APL who received induction therapy with ATO (0.06 to 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. CR was achieved in 88 percent at a median time of 47 days. A rising white blood cell count (WBC) <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;10,000/microL</span> was noted during ATO treatment in 15 patients, with the WBC <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;100,000/microL</span> in three. Eight patients (31 percent) developed &quot;differentiation syndrome&quot; (a cytokine release mediated phenomenon) at a mean time of 17 days (range 7 to 24 days), and required treatment with corticosteroids. This syndrome was only noted during induction therapy with ATO; neither leukocytosis nor the differentiation syndrome was seen during any postremission courses. Three patients remained positive for the <em><span class=\"nowrap\">PML/RARA</em></span> transcript and relapsed early [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a larger series, 47 patients with relapsed APL (43 in first relapse and two each in second and third relapse) received ATO with or without other agents; 31 with ATO alone, 11 with ATO and moderate chemotherapy, and 5 with ATO and ATRA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. CR was obtained in 85 percent, with median disease-free and overall survival rates of 17 and 25 months, respectively. More than two-thirds of the patients treated with ATO alone or chemotherapy alone after attaining CR subsequently relapsed, as compared with only 2 of 11 patients treated with ATO and chemotherapy after attaining CR.

Prolongation of the QT interval was seen in 63 percent; one patient had an asymptomatic 7-beat run of torsade.

Allogeneic HCT can be considered if a suitable donor is available, but for APL, allogeneic HCT is not clearly better than autologous HCT. For patients who do not achieve RT-PCR negativity, allogeneic HCT is the preferred treatment in eligible patients with an available donor.</p><p>Studies of combination therapy with other agents are ongoing and have mixed preliminary results. As an example, a small randomized study of 20 patients with APL relapsed after initial treatment with ATRA and anthracycline-based chemotherapy, found no benefit with the addition of ATRA to ATO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Reversible prolongation of the QT interval to &gt;500 msec occurred in 38 patients; the risk was increased in patients with hypokalemia, with one hypokalemic patient developing torsade de pointes. Hyperglycemia has also been noted.</p><p>Labeling instructions for this agent recommend that, during therapy, serum potassium concentrations should be kept &gt;4.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> and magnesium concentrations &gt;1.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Maintaining an adequate hemoglobin level and oxygenation may also be important to reduce cardiac toxicity. ATO should be held if the absolute QT interval exceeds 500 msec or if the patient develops syncope or an irregular heartbeat. ATO can be reinstated if these symptoms resolve and the absolute QT interval decreases to 460 msec or below.
