These include vaccines for four types of <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em> (meningococcus): A, C, W135, and Y; tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis; and human papillomavirus. Influenza vaccine is recommended annually. Because the recommendation to add a second dose of varicella vaccine was made in 2006, some children will also need a second dose of varicella vaccine if both doses were not given previously.</p><p>The meningococcal B vaccine is routinely recommended for adolescents at increased risk of meningococcal B disease. Although it is not routinely recommended for other adolescents, it is an option for healthy adolescents who wish to protect themselves from the disease.</p><p>The recommended schedule is available through the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/downloads/teen/parent-version-schedule-7-18yrs.pdf&amp;token=zeC1PoG3llQ5BmDN5esZufd306+EhPHrxd1Ddny+zWsAi2QhwXn+iISLaHwDcT/ryFiEXWqlGxPCR10bASr3znhR3LjxVIjw/MxU9jPEtJ38ZY0wvz1y1MAyW1B0R7DB&amp;TOPIC_ID=1218\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p><p>A separate topic review is available that discusses how vaccines work, the risks and benefits of vaccines, and common concerns regarding vaccine safety (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=why-does-my-child-need-vaccines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Why does my child need vaccines? (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>). A topic review is also available that discusses vaccines for infants and children age 0 to 6 years.

Young children, older adults, and those with certain underlying medical conditions are at increased risk for severe or complicated influenza infection. Immunizing all children (and adults) can help decrease this risk. The influenza vaccine does not prevent illnesses such as the common cold or strep throat. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-symptoms-and-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Influenza symptoms and treatment (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing and dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are three ways to receive the flu vaccine: injection into muscle (intramuscularly), injection under the skin (intradermally), or as a nasal spray. In the United States, the nasal spray vaccine is not recommended for the 2017-2018 influenza season.</p><p>The intramuscular injection can be given to adults and children 6 months and older, the intradermal injection can be given to adults 18 to 64 years of age, and the intranasal spray can only be given to people between 2 and 49 years of age. People who have a weakened immune system, are pregnant, or who have chronic heart, lung, kidney, or metabolic disease should not use the intranasal spray since it contains live virus that has been weakened. In very rare situations, household contacts of those who have <strong>severely</strong> weakened immune systems should also not receive the intranasal spray.</p><p>The influenza viruses change every year, which means that a reformulated vaccine must be given every year (most commonly in the fall but is often administered through March). In the first year that a child (younger than age 9 years) receives the vaccine, two doses are recommended; the second dose is given at least one month after the first. In subsequent years, most children younger than nine years will need only one dose, but some may need two doses.</p><p>The vaccine is recommended for <strong>all</strong> children 6 months and older, particularly those who:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have chronic medical conditions (eg, lung or heart disease, diabetes, kidney disease, weakened immune conditions, nervous system disorders)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Live with a person who is at high risk for complications of influenza (eg, someone with chronic lung disease)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Influenza vaccine precautions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A history of Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome within six weeks of a flu vaccine is a precaution for all flu vaccines. Flu vaccine should only be given if the benefit of vaccination outweighs the risk. Egg allergy is no longer a precaution or contraindication to influenza vaccine; those with severe allergic reactions to eggs may be vaccinated using any available product in an outpatient or inpatient setting under the supervision of a provider capable of recognizing and managing anaphylaxis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Injectable influenza vaccine precautions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaccination may be delayed in children with moderate to severe illness until their symptoms have resolved. However, the vaccine does not need to be delayed in children with mild illnesses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H446751531\"><span class=\"h3\">Injectable influenza vaccine side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common side effect of the injectable vaccine is redness and soreness at the injection site. A low-grade fever may develop after vaccination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Fever in children (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Nasal spray influenza vaccine precautions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, the nasal spray influenza vaccine is not recommended for the 2017-2018 influenza season. In other countries, the nasal spray vaccine is not recommended for children who take aspirin daily or those with a weakened immune system, asthma, and other conditions (eg, chronic lung or heart problems, pregnancy, chronic metabolic disease, kidney dysfunction, and blood disorders). It may be necessary to delay the nasal vaccine or to use the injectable vaccine in children or adolescents with nasal congestion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H949462576\"><span class=\"h2\">Influenza vaccine side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common side effects with the injectable influenza vaccines is pain at the injection site. Serious side effects are rare.</p><p>Side effects after the nasal spray vaccine may include nasal congestion or low-grade fever.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">MENINGOCOCCAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Neisseria meningitidis</em> (meningococcus) is a bacterium that can cause meningitis and meningococcemia. Meningitis is an inflammation of the tissues surrounding the brain and spinal cord that causes symptoms of a stiff and painful neck. Meningococcus is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis among children and adolescents in the United States. Meningococcemia is a serious infection of the bloodstream that can begin with dramatic rash and fever and lead to shock and death. Meningitis and meningococcemia may occur separately or together.</p><p>In 2013, there were 550 total cases of meningococcal disease reported in the United States. Large-scale epidemics occur in Africa, parts of Asia, South America, and the countries of the former Soviet Union.</p><p>Meningococcus first infects the lining of the nose and pharynx (wind pipe) and is transmitted from person to person by respiratory secretions (eg, from coughing, sneezing). Meningococcal infection is contagious and can spread quickly to close contacts of a person who is infected. This includes household members and anyone who kisses or shares toothbrushes or eating utensils.</p><p>Meningococcal disease can be treated in most people. However, the illness is frequently mistaken for a common viral illness (eg, cold) during the early stages, delaying diagnosis. Meningococcal disease often progresses quickly to serious illness or death. Serious long-term complications can occur, even in people who are treated promptly. Up to 15 percent of people who become infected die as a result of their infection. In survivors, 10 to 20 percent of patients have long-term complications, including hearing loss, nerve or brain injury, <span class=\"nowrap\">finger/toe/limb</span> amputation, or skin scarring.</p><p>Meningococcal vaccines are available to protect against the five common subtypes of meningococcus affecting humans (subtypes A, C, W135, Y, and B). It is possible to become infected with meningococcus despite having received one of these vaccines, although the risk is significantly lower than in someone who is unvaccinated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meningitis-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Meningitis in children (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing and dose</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Children not at increased risk of meningococcal disease</strong> &ndash; Expert groups recommend the meningococcal vaccine that protects against types A, C, W135, and Y meningococcal disease for all children age 11 or 12 years and a booster dose at age 16 years. Adolescents who receive the first dose of this vaccine between 13 and 15 years should receive a booster dose between 16 and 18 years of age. Those who receive the first dose after age 16 years do not need a booster dose.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The vaccine that protects against type B meningococcal disease is not routinely recommended for children and adolescents who are not at increased risk for meningococcal disease. However, it may be administered to adolescents and young adults 16 through 23 years of age, preferably between 16 and 18 years of age, after they discuss the vaccine with their doctor or nurse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Children at increased risk of meningococcal disease</strong> &ndash; The meningococcal vaccine that protects against types A, C, W135, and Y meningococcal disease is recommended for children aged 2 months to 10 years who are at increased risk for meningococcal disease. In addition, the meningococcal vaccine that protects against type B meningococcal disease is recommended for people 10 years and older who are at increased risk of meningococcal disease. The vaccination schedule for children at increased risk for meningococcal disease depends upon the underlying medical condition and whether they remain at increased risk for disease.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Meningococcal vaccine side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 70 percent of people have a local reaction (eg, tenderness, redness) at the injection site.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">TETANUS AND DIPHTHERIA, WITH OR WITHOUT ACELLULAR PERTUSSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diphtheria is a highly contagious disease. It is usually transmitted via droplet particles that are coughed or sneezed into the air. It can cause a thick covering in the back of the throat that can lead to breathing problems or heart failure.</p><p>Tetanus is another very serious infection that is caused by the bacterial toxin of <em>Clostridium tetani</em> bacterium. The bacteria reside in soil and the intestinal tracts of certain mammals. The bacteria can enter the body through an open wound, multiply, and produce a toxin that can affect nerves controlling muscle activity. A common symptom of tetanus infection is stiffness of the jaw muscles (&quot;lockjaw&quot;).</p><p>Tetanus and diphtheria disease are rare in the United States because of the high numbers of people who have been immunized. However, the consequences of untreated tetanus or diphtheria can be very serious.</p><p>Pertussis, or whooping cough, is an upper respiratory illness caused by the toxin of <em>Bordetella pertussis</em> bacteria. The organism is highly contagious, spreads easily and can cause serious illness, especially in infants.</p><p>The number of people infected with pertussis is at epidemic levels, especially in adolescents, despite widespread vaccination. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported over 48,000 cases of whooping cough in the United States in 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-children-age-7-to-18-years-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Since pertussis is significantly underreported, the number of people actually infected with pertussis each year in the United States is likely closer to 1 to 3 million.</p><p>Pertussis was added to the traditional Td booster for teenagers and adults because the vaccine's protection decreases after 5 to 8 years. Protection also decreases after being infected with pertussis. Thus, the vaccine is recommended even for people who have had the disease.</p><p>There are several forms of combined diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccines:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The DTaP, or diphtheria tetanus acellular pertussis vaccine, is used for routine immunization of children younger than 7 years of age.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Tdap, or tetanus, reduced diphtheria, acellular pertussis vaccine, is recommended as a routine one-time dose for children at 11 to 12 years, for adolescents 13 to 18 years who were not previously immunized, and for pregnant women during each pregnancy. The vaccine is also recommended as a one-time dose for adults requiring the Td booster who have not previously received a Tdap, and as one of the series of catch-up doses of tetanus and diphtheria toxoid (Td) vaccines for children between 7 and 10 years of age who are incompletely vaccinated against tetanus, diphtheria, or pertussis.

Tdap is recommended unless there is an allergy to one of the vaccine components.</p><p>If an adolescent has an injury that requires a tetanus shot, Tdap may be given instead of Td, provided that the adolescent has not received Tdap previously. Only one dose of Tdap is recommended in a lifetime unless a young woman is pregnant; Tdap is recommended with each pregnancy to protect the infant. Repeated doses of Tdap have been shown to be safe. Subsequent booster doses of Td are recommended every 10 years throughout life.

The risk of HPV exposure increases with the number of sexual partners. Most sexually active persons become infected with HPV at least once in their lifetime [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-children-age-7-to-18-years-beyond-the-basics/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Over 100 different types of HPV have been identified, approximately 40 of which are known to infect the anogenital region and 15 of which are known to cause cancer. Researchers have labeled the HPV types as being high or low risk for cervical cancer. HPV types 6 and 11 can cause warts and are low-risk types because they rarely cause cervical or other cancers. Types 16 and 18 are high-risk types and cause most cases of cervical and other types of cancer (vaginal, vulvar, penile, anal, oropharyngeal); other high-risk types include 31, 33, 45, 52, 58. The HPV vaccine available in the United States protects against HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58.</p><p>The vaccine against HPV is available for males and females. The vaccine is discussed in greater detail separately.

The disease causes fever, sore throat, and a distinctive, itchy rash with fluid-filled blisters that later form scabs. Complications of chickenpox can include bacterial infections of the skin, pneumonia, or, less commonly, inflammation of the brain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chickenpox-prevention-and-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Chickenpox prevention and treatment (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A vaccine to prevent chickenpox is recommended for all children. Two doses of varicella vaccine are recommended for children 0 to 6 years of age; the first is usually given at 1 year of age and the second at 4 to 6 years. A second dose is recommended if a child or adult is older than 7 years and was not previously given two doses of vaccine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER VACCINES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children who are 7 to 18 years may need vaccines other than those mentioned above if they have missed any of the recommended vaccines for children age 0 to 6 years.
