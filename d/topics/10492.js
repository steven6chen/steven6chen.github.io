Monotherapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> is indicated for most patients, and insulin may be indicated for initial treatment for some [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-persistent-hyperglycemia-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although several studies have noted remissions of type 2 diabetes mellitus that may last several years, most patients require continuous treatment in order to maintain normal or near-normal glycemia. Bariatric surgical procedures in obese patients that result in major weight loss have been shown to lead to remission in a substantial fraction of patients. Regardless of the initial response to therapy, the natural history of most patients with type 2 diabetes is for blood glucose concentrations to rise gradually with time.</p><p>Treatment for hyperglycemia that fails to respond to initial monotherapy and long-term pharmacologic therapy in type 2 diabetes is reviewed here. Options for initial therapy and other therapeutic issues in diabetes management, such as the frequency of monitoring and evaluation for microvascular and macrovascular complications, are discussed separately.

We are aware that this A1C goal is not appropriate for all patients, especially older adults and those with comorbid conditions or limited life expectancy. Target A1C goals in patients with type 2 diabetes should be tailored to the individual, balancing the improvement in microvascular complications with the risk of hypoglycemia. Glycemic targets are generally set somewhat higher for older patients and those with comorbidities or a limited life expectancy and little likelihood of benefit from intensive therapy. Glycemic targets are reviewed in more detail separately.

An analysis from the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) found that 50 percent of relatively new-onset patients identified clinically and originally controlled with a single drug required the addition of a second drug after three years; by nine years, 75 percent of patients needed multiple therapies to achieve the target A1C value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-persistent-hyperglycemia-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

In a meta-analysis of 179 trials and 25 observational studies evaluating the effects of oral or injectable diabetes medications as monotherapy and in combination with other oral agents or insulin on intermediate outcomes (A1C, body weight, lipid profiles), combination therapy decreased A1C levels more than monotherapy by approximately 1 percentage point [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-persistent-hyperglycemia-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

In addition, there are few data on benefits and risks in patients who have not had a major CVD event.

However, in certain clinical settings, such as especially high risk for hypoglycemia or intolerance of or contraindications to sulfonylureas, a thiazolidinedione may be added. As an example, in a patient who would be at particularly high risk if hypoglycemia occurred (eg, a construction worker) and who has inadequate glycemic control on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> (A1C &gt;7 but &lt;8.5 percent), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pioglitazone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pioglitazone</a> (where available) could be used. The use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosiglitazone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rosiglitazone</a> is not recommended, because of the greater concern about its atherogenic lipid profiles and a potential increased risk for cardiovascular events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-persistent-hyperglycemia-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In 2010, the European Medicines Agency suspended sales of rosiglitazone, owing to concern regarding cardiovascular safety and the availability of alternative therapies, including pioglitazone, that do not have the same concerns. In 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) imposed marked restrictions on the prescribing of rosiglitazone because of concerns about increased risk of acute myocardial infarction and cardiovascular deaths. These restrictions were largely removed by the FDA in 2013, although the absence of an adverse effect of rosiglitazone on cardiovascular risk has not been excluded. In 2011, the French and German Medicines Agencies suspended the use of pioglitazone because of the potential increased risk of bladder cancer and the concern that the overall risks of pioglitazone exceed its benefits. The European Medicines Agency, the FDA, and Japanese regulators withheld action on pioglitazone pending results of ongoing review of the data.

For patients who are doing well on these particular doses, the combination tablets offer the convenience of taking fewer pills. However, if the patient needs the dose of either drug to be changed independent of the other drug, then a fixed combination is unhelpful. In addition, the cost of the brand name combinations is substantially greater than taking the generic components individually.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7554448\"><span class=\"h2\">Sulfonylurea monotherapy failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In individuals with contraindications to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a>, sulfonylureas are often first-line therapy. Shorter-acting sulfonylureas, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glipizide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glipizide</a>, are less likely to cause hypoglycemia than the older, long-acting sulfonylureas and therefore are the preferred sulfonylureas, especially in older patients.

The choice of therapy should be individualized based upon patient characteristics, preferences, and costs. Options include thiazolidinediones, DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists, sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, and insulin. All of these medications have advantages and disadvantages (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F56876\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56876 \">table 2</a>), and all of the newer medicines that are not available in generic form are relatively expensive. Hypoglycemia remains a risk when any of these medications are used in combination with a sulfonylurea.

In patients on sulfonylureas and metformin who are starting insulin therapy, sulfonylureas are generally tapered and discontinued, while metformin is continued. Part of the rationale for combination metformin and insulin therapy is that by suppressing hepatic glucose production, the patient can retain the convenience of oral agents while minimizing total insulin requirements and therefore the degree of hyperinsulinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-persistent-hyperglycemia-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Another option is two oral agents and a GLP-1 receptor agonist.

At study end (24 weeks), improvements in A1C (approximately 1.5 percentage points) were similar in both groups. However, insulin glargine was superior in reducing A1C values when baseline A1C values were &gt;9.5 percent. Although insulin glargine was associated with more hypoglycemic events, there were fewer overall adverse events, significant improvements in the serum lipid profile, and it was less expensive. Subjects treated with insulin glargine also reported greater improvements in several health-related, quality-of-life measurements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-persistent-hyperglycemia-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. These findings, combined with the greater concern about adverse cardiovascular events with thiazolidinediones, particularly rosiglitazone, favor the addition of insulin glargine over rosiglitazone.
