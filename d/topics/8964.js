For men with advanced disease, it is supplemented with a validated prognostic model that was developed by the International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group (IGCCCG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-risk-stratified-treatment-for-advanced-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>In the IGCCCG prognostic classification system, patients with disseminated disease (stages Is and II to III) are divided into good-, intermediate-, and poor-risk groups for both progression-free and overall survival (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F61906\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61906 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-risk-stratified-treatment-for-advanced-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>]. It is based upon the histology of the tumor (seminoma versus nonseminoma), primary site of the GCT, metastatic sites of involvement, and levels of serum tumor markers (drawn on day 1 of the first cycle, prior to initiation of chemotherapy, and after the initial radical orchiectomy). </p><p>The risk stratification system is important for the identification of appropriate treatment for men with GCTs.

Serum levels of beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are not used in assigning risk status to patients with seminoma, although one or both are often elevated. </p><p>Men with a pathologic diagnosis of seminoma but with a highly elevated beta-hCG (eg, beta-hCG &gt;1000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L)</span> or any elevation of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) are considered to have a NSGCT, even if other histologic elements are not identified on pathologic review. However, trivial elevations of serum AFP (&lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> should be interpreted cautiously, and for the purposes of classifying GCTs, any AFP less than 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> should generally be considered normal, regardless of the reporting laboratory's normal range.

For men at risk for pulmonary toxicity from bleomycin and for men over the age of 50, we prefer EP. If BEP is used, three cycles should be given.

The largest study, conducted by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), randomized 812 subjects to either three or four cycles of BEP.

There were 12 deaths in each arm.
