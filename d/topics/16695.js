Children commonly swallow things such as coins, small toys, or batteries. Sometimes, adults swallow objects. This is more likely to happen when people are drunk, have loose dentures, or have certain brain disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11326515\"><span class=\"h1\">Is it harmful to swallow an object that isn't food?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Not usually. When a person swallows an object, the object travels through the person's digestive tract. The digestive tract is made up of the esophagus (the tube from the mouth to the stomach), stomach, small intestine, and large intestine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F66110\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66110 \">figure 1</a>). Most swallowed objects travel through and leave the body in a bowel movement without causing problems.</p><p>But some swallowed objects can cause problems or are likely to cause problems. These objects need to be removed from the digestive tract by a doctor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11326530\"><span class=\"h1\">What symptoms can swallowing an object cause?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people have no symptoms. If people do have symptoms, they can have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble swallowing food</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drooling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the neck or chest</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coughing, trouble breathing, or noisy breathing</p><p/><p>These symptoms are more likely to happen when the object is stuck in the esophagus. Usually, the symptoms last as long as the object is stuck. But sometimes, the symptoms go away even though the object is still stuck.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11326545\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I do if my child swallows an object?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you see your child swallow an object, or your child tells you he or she swallowed an object, call the doctor or nurse right away. Depending on the object and your child's symptoms, your child might need to see the doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11326560\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I do if an adult swallows an object?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you or someone you know swallows an object, call the doctor or nurse right away. Depending on the object and the symptoms it causes, the person might need to see the doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11326575\"><span class=\"h1\">Do people who swallow an object need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sometimes. The doctor or nurse will ask about the object and how long ago it was swallowed. He or she will also ask about symptoms and do an exam.</p><p>Depending on the object and the person's symptoms, the doctor or nurse might order X-rays of the neck, chest, or belly. Swallowed objects made out of certain materials can show up on the X-rays.</p><p>The X-rays help show where the object is inside your body. Usually, swallowed objects are in the digestive tract. But sometimes, swallowed objects fall into a person's airway, because the airway is next to the esophagus. Objects in the airway need to be removed because they can cause serious problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11326590\"><span class=\"h1\">Do swallowed objects need to be removed?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some objects need to be removed from the body, but others don't. It depends on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What the object is &ndash; Objects that can easily or seriously damage the inside of the body usually need to be removed right away. Harmful objects include batteries (including button or disc batteries) and magnets. They also include objects that are sharp, long, or made of lead. Lead is a metal that can damage a child's brain, kidneys, or other organs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Where the object is in the digestive tract &ndash; Objects that are stuck in the esophagus usually need to be removed right away.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the person who swallowed the object has symptoms</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How long the object has been in the body</p><p/><p>If the object doesn't need to be removed, the doctor or nurse might have you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Check the person's bowel movements to make sure the object leaves his or her body. It usually takes a few days for an object to leave the body in a bowel movement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Watch the person for symptoms that could mean the object is harming the digestive tract. Let the doctor or nurse know if the person starts to have any of the following symptoms:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nausea or vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Belly pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Bloody bowel movements</p><p/><p>The doctor might also order follow-up X-rays to check that the object is moving through the digestive tract.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11326605\"><span class=\"h1\">How will the doctor remove the swallowed object?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To remove an object from the esophagus or stomach, the doctor will do a procedure called an upper endoscopy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F75392\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75392 \">figure 2</a>). During this procedure, the doctor will put a thin tube with a camera and light on the end (called an endoscope) into the person's mouth. He or she will move the tube down into the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum (the first part of the small intestine) to look for the object. Then he or she can use special tools to grab the object and pull it out through the person's mouth.</p><p>To remove an object from the intestines, the doctor might need to do surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11326620\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=upper-endoscopy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Upper endoscopy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lead-poisoning-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Lead poisoning (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
