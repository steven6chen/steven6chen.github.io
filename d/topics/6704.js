It is often classified as either primary (absence of menarche by age 15 years or thereafter) or secondary (absence of menses for more than three months in girls or women who previously had regular menstrual cycles or six months in girls or women who had irregular menses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-secondary-amenorrhea/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]). Missing a single menstrual period may not be important to assess, but amenorrhea lasting three months or more and oligomenorrhea (fewer than nine menstrual cycles per year or cycle length greater than 35 days) require investigation. The etiologic and diagnostic considerations for oligomenorrhea are the same as for secondary amenorrhea.</p><p>The evaluation of secondary amenorrhea and a brief summary of treatment options are reviewed here. The epidemiology and causes of secondary amenorrhea and overviews of primary amenorrhea and abnormal uterine bleeding in adolescents are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-causes-of-secondary-amenorrhea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and causes of secondary amenorrhea&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-primary-amenorrhea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of primary amenorrhea&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-adolescents-evaluation-and-approach-to-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abnormal uterine bleeding in adolescents: Evaluation and approach to diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once pregnancy has been ruled out, a logical approach to women with either primary or secondary amenorrhea is to consider disorders based upon the levels of control of the menstrual cycle: hypothalamus, pituitary, ovary, and uterus. Determining the site of the defect is important because it determines the appropriate therapeutic regimen. While the most common causes of secondary amenorrhea are likely to be functional hypothalamic amenorrhea or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), disorders with an anatomic or pathologic cause must be ruled out (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F109616\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109616 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-secondary-amenorrhea/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Rule out pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A pregnancy test is recommended as a first step in evaluating any woman with secondary amenorrhea. Measurement of serum beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is the most sensitive test. Commercially available home kits for measurement of hCG in urine are improving, but the clinician who suspects pregnancy should order a serum hCG measurement, even if the woman had a negative home test.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The woman should be asked about any past medical history, risk factors, or symptoms that might suggest any of the major causes of secondary amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F109616\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109616 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F59801\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59801 \">table 1</a>). The history should include the following questions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has there been stress, change in weight, diet, or exercise habits, or is there an eating disorder or illness (that might result in functional hypothalamic amenorrhea)? (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-causes-of-secondary-amenorrhea#H689399617\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and causes of secondary amenorrhea&quot;, section on 'Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the woman taking any drugs that might cause or be associated with amenorrhea? The drug may be taken for a systemic illness that itself can cause hypothalamic amenorrhea. Newly initiated or discontinued oral contraceptives can be associated with several months of amenorrhea, as can androgenic drugs like <a href=\"topic.htm?path=danazol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">danazol</a> or a high-dose progestin. Other drugs cause amenorrhea by increasing serum prolactin (PRL) concentrations, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a> and antipsychotic drugs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hyperprolactinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hyperprolactinemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there hirsutism, acne, and a history of irregular menses (suggestive of hyperandrogenism)? (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there symptoms of hypothalamic-pituitary disease, including headaches, visual field defects, fatigue, or polyuria and polydipsia? (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-presentation-and-evaluation-of-sellar-masses\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes, presentation, and evaluation of sellar masses&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there any symptoms of estrogen deficiency, including hot flashes, vaginal dryness, poor sleep, or decreased libido? These symptoms may be prominent with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). In contrast, women with hypothalamic amenorrhea do <strong>not</strong> usually have these symptoms, despite the presence of similarly low serum estradiol (E2) concentrations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-autoimmune-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of autoimmune primary ovarian insufficiency (premature ovarian failure)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-causes-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and causes of spontaneous primary ovarian insufficiency (premature ovarian failure)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has the patient had galactorrhea, which suggests hyperprolactinemia?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there a history of obstetrical catastrophe, severe bleeding, dilatation and curettage, or endometritis or other infection that might have caused scarring of the endometrial lining (Asherman syndrome)? (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrauterine-adhesions-clinical-manifestation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrauterine adhesions: Clinical manifestation and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1489618499\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical exam</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the medical history, the physical examination may provide clues about the possible cause of amenorrhea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F109616\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109616 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F59801\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59801 \">table 1</a>). The examination in women with secondary amenorrhea should include measurements of height and weight. A body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> is observed in 50 percent or more of women with PCOS, depending on the population studied. Women with a BMI less than 18.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> may have functional hypothalamic amenorrhea due to an eating disorder, strenuous exercise, or a systemic illness associated with weight loss. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-hypothalamic-amenorrhea-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea: Pathophysiology and clinical manifestations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The patient should also be examined for hirsutism, acne, striae, acanthosis nigricans, vitiligo, and easy bruisability. Breasts should be examined for evidence of galactorrhea, and a vulvovaginal exam should look for signs of estrogen deficiency. Parotid gland swelling <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> erosion of dental enamel would suggest an eating disorder (bulimia nervosa). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bulimia-nervosa-and-binge-eating-disorder-in-adults-medical-complications-and-their-management#H338186\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder in adults: Medical complications and their management&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial laboratory testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial laboratory evaluation (after ruling out pregnancy) for women with secondary amenorrhea should include follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), serum PRL, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) to test for POI, hyperprolactinemia, and thyroid disease, respectively. If there has been a recent menstrual cycle, a test on days 2 to 4 would be appropriate, but in prolonged amenorrhea, the testing can be performed on a random day (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F109616\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109616 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>The clinical utility of this approach (measuring FSH, PRL, TSH) was examined in a study of 127 women with adult-onset amenorrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-secondary-amenorrhea/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. High serum FSH concentrations, high PRL, and abnormal TSH were seen in 10, 7.5, and 2.5 percent of patients, respectively, suggesting that this is a reasonable approach to initial testing in women with secondary amenorrhea.</p><p>Some clinicians suggest adding serum E2 as one of the initial tests to use with the serum FSH to evaluate the pituitary-ovarian axis. Low or normal E2 that is associated with an elevated FSH indicates POI, while low or normal E2 associated with FSH that is normal or low suggests the possibility of secondary (pituitary or hypothalamic) hypogonadism, either structural or functional.<strong> </strong>Interpretation of the serum E2 should also take into account that levels change across the menstrual cycle and it may be variable in women with either early POI or functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (during recovery). In addition, a single sample may not reflect exposure to E2 over weeks. For this reason, E2 status should also be assessed with a progestin withdrawal test or measurement of endometrial thickness on pelvic ultrasound. (See <a href=\"#H1489618573\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of estrogen status'</a> below.)</p><p>If there is clinical evidence of hyperandrogenism (hirsutism, acne, scalp hair loss [alopecia]), serum total testosterone should be measured in addition to the initial laboratory tests listed for women without hyperandrogenism. Many clinicians also measure serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) concentration. In addition, many measure 17-hydroxyprogesterone at the initial visit to rule out nonclassic 21-hydroxylase deficiency (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F109616\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109616 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1052665176\" class=\"local\">'High serum androgen concentrations'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-premenopausal-women-with-hirsutism#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of premenopausal women with hirsutism&quot;, section on 'Biochemical testing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Follow-up testing based upon initial results</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Further evaluation depends upon the results of the initial evaluation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1489618573\"><span class=\"h3\">Assessment of estrogen status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An assessment of estrogen status should be done in some cases to help with interpreting the FSH values and in others to help guide therapy (eg, hypoestrogenic patients need estrogen therapy for prevention of bone loss, while those making estrogen need endometrial protection with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a>). Estrogen status over time can be assessed with a progestin withdrawal test (medroxyprogesterone 10 mg for 10 days). Withdrawal bleeding confirms that there has been endogenous estrogen exposure. Absence of bleeding can be due to either hypoestrogenism or an outflow tract disorder. (See <a href=\"#H1489618880\" class=\"local\">'Normal laboratory results and history of uterine instrumentation'</a> below.)</p><p>Some clinicians use endometrial thickness on pelvic ultrasound (&lt;4 mm is consistent with hypoestrogenism), but this is not performed routinely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-secondary-amenorrhea/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. We typically perform the progestin withdrawal test instead.</p><p>Serum E2 measurements can also be used to assess estrogen status, as described above. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Initial laboratory testing'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1489618729\"><span class=\"h3\">Normal or low serum FSH concentrations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with normal serum PRL and TSH, a low or normal serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentration, and no history of uterine instrumentation are likely to have a hypothalamic-pituitary disorder or PCOS. A serum FSH concentration that is low or &quot;normal&quot; is inappropriately low in the presence of a low serum E2 concentration and indicates secondary (hypogonadotropic) hypogonadism. This constellation is one of the most common outcomes of laboratory testing in women with amenorrhea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F109616\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109616 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>Although we do not recommend measuring serum luteinizing hormone (LH) level as one of our initial laboratory tests, it can be helpful in the occasional patient who has features of both functional hypothalamic amenorrhea and PCOS (eg, amenorrhea with mild hirsutism <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> acne, but <span class=\"nowrap\">normal/low</span> BMI and a history of exercise) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-secondary-amenorrhea/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Serum FSH concentrations are low or normal in both functional hypothalamic amenorrhea and PCOS. Serum FSH is typically higher than LH in women with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea; in women with PCOS, serum FSH is typically lower than LH. In addition, women with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea are hypoestrogenic, while women with PCOS are typically well estrogenized. (See <a href=\"#H1489618573\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of estrogen status'</a> above.)</p><p>Hypothalamic amenorrhea can also be seen with systemic illness such as celiac disease and type 1 diabetes mellitus (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-hypothalamic-amenorrhea-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea: Pathophysiology and clinical manifestations&quot;</a>). We therefore suggest measurement of fasting blood glucose or glycated hemoglobin (A1C) to rule out diabetes mellitus if the patient has polyuria and polydipsia and serologic screening for celiac disease with immunoglobulin A antibodies against tissue transglutaminase (tTG-IgA) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of celiac disease in children&quot;</a>). Other specific tests may be done, depending upon the clinical history. As an example, iron studies to test for hemochromatosis should be performed if there is an appropriate family history or if the patient has manifestations of iron overload (bronzed skin, diabetes mellitus, or unexplained heart or liver disease). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-iron-overload\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with suspected iron overload&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the sella region is indicated in all women without a clear explanation for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, such as weight loss, exercise, or stress, and in all women who have normal laboratory findings and symptoms such as visual field defects, headaches, or other signs of hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-causes-of-secondary-amenorrhea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and causes of secondary amenorrhea&quot;</a>). In contrast, no further testing is required if the onset of amenorrhea occurred recently or is easily explained and there are no symptoms suggestive of other disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F109616\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109616 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1489618818\"><span class=\"h3\">High serum prolactin concentration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PRL secretion can be transiently increased by stress. As a result, if serum PRL is high, we recommend that it be repeated before pituitary MRI is ordered, particularly in women with mild elevations (&lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [&lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L])</span>. All of these women should be screened for thyroid disease because hypothyroidism can sometimes cause hyperprolactinemia. (See <a href=\"#H1489618941\" class=\"local\">'Abnormal TSH'</a> below.)</p><p>If a mildly elevated serum PRL is confirmed to be high on a second sample, or if the initial sample is &gt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (&gt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L),</span> a pituitary MRI should be performed unless a very clear explanation is found for the elevation (eg, untreated hypothyroidism or antipsychotic drug use). The goal of imaging is to evaluate the possibility of a hypothalamic or pituitary lesion. In the case of a lactotroph adenoma, the image will allow determination of whether it is a microadenoma or a macroadenoma (&le;1 or &gt;1 cm, respectively). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-hyperprolactinemia#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and evaluation of hyperprolactinemia&quot;, section on 'Laboratory/imaging tests'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1489617823\"><span class=\"h3\">High serum FSH concentration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A high serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentration indicates POI, formerly referred to as premature ovarian failure. It should be kept in mind, however, that intermittent follicular development does occur in women with POI, resulting in transient normalization of serum FSH concentrations. During times of ovarian inactivity and amenorrhea, FSH is high and serum E2 is low, similar to what is seen in normal menopause. The presence of hot flashes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vaginal dryness is suggestive of POI as these symptoms are uncommon in women with menstrual disturbances due to other causes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F109616\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109616 \">algorithm 1</a>).

In women with 46,XX spontaneous POI, we also suggest testing for antiadrenal antibodies and the fragile X premutation.

Many clinicians start with a progestin challenge (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> 10 mg for 10 days). If withdrawal bleeding occurs, an outflow tract disorder has been ruled out.</p><p>If bleeding does not occur, estrogen and progestin may be administered. The endometrium may be primed with oral conjugated estrogens 0.625 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> or their equivalent (oral estradiol 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> transdermal estradiol 0.05 mg) for 35 days. A progestin is then added from days 26 to 35 (typically medroxyprogesterone 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span>. Failure to bleed upon cessation of this therapy strongly suggests endometrial scarring. In this situation, a hysterosalpingogram or direct visualization of the endometrial cavity with a hysteroscope can confirm the diagnosis of intrauterine adhesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F109616\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109616 \">algorithm 1</a>).

Of note, many women with PCOS present with hyperandrogenism (acne, hirsutism) without hyperandrogenemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F109616\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109616 \">algorithm 1</a>).

A stepwise approach to the history, physical examination, and laboratory testing usually results in a specific diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Approach to evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy is a common cause of secondary amenorrhea and should be excluded based on a sensitive pregnancy test (human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG]). (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Rule out pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The history and physical exam may provide clues about the possible cause of amenorrhea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F59801\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59801 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial laboratory evaluation (after ruling out pregnancy) for women with secondary amenorrhea is slightly different for those with and without hyperandrogenism. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Initial laboratory testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Initial laboratory testing for women with amenorrhea without hyperandrogenism should include serum prolactin (PRL), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) to test for hyperprolactinemia, ovarian failure, and thyroid disease, respectively. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Initial laboratory testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Assessment of estrogen status is done in some cases to help with interpreting the FSH values and in others to help guide therapy (eg, hypoestrogenic patients need estrogen therapy for prevention of bone loss, while those making estrogen need endometrial protection with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1489618573\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of estrogen status'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If there is clinical evidence of hyperandrogenism (hirsutism, acne, scalp hair loss [alopecia]), serum total testosterone should be measured in addition to the initial laboratory tests. (See <a href=\"#H1052665176\" class=\"local\">'High serum androgen concentrations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Further evaluation depends upon the results of the initial evaluation. Important categories include normal or low serum FSH, high FSH, high serum PRL, normal laboratory results with a history of uterine instrumentation, high serum androgen concentrations, and abnormal TSH.
