A more restrained approach favored by other experts is to measure PVR volume in symptomatic patients prior to initiating anticholinergic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-management-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The management of neurogenic bladder dysfunction in patients with MS has several goals, including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-management-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preserving renal function</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attaining social continence</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimizing urinary tract complications</p><p/><p>Treatment of bladder dysfunction in patients with MS involves suppressing urgency and ensuring effective urinary drainage. Initial therapy for sphincter dysfunction is adjustment of fluid intake (eg, restriction of fluids to &le;2 L a day) and regimented bathroom stops (ie, timed voiding).</p><p>For patients with the failure to store type of bladder dysfunction (eg, detrusor overactivity), anticholinergic and antimuscarinic drugs remain the primary medical treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-management-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxybutynin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Oxybutynin</a> is a first-line medication for bladder dysfunction. Dosing is 2.5 to 5 mg, one to three times per day. There is an extended-release preparation as well as a transdermal preparation (oxybutynin 3.9 mg patch twice weekly), which may have the advantage of improved compliance. Oxybutynin decreases bladder emptying and consequently increases PVR; hence, it is important to check the PVR before starting this treatment, and then again subsequently after the first few weeks of continuous therapy. Other anticholinergic drugs include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tolterodine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tolterodine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propantheline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propantheline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propiverine-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propiverine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fesoterodine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fesoterodine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=solifenacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">solifenacin</a>. Since these drugs increase PVR, adjunctive treatment with clean intermittent catheterization may be helpful to achieve efficient bladder emptying and continence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-management-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Dual therapy is effective and well-tolerated in some patients. This may involve using medications with different mechanisms of action, such as anticholinergic agents, cholinergic agonists, alpha-adrenergic blocking agents, tricyclic antidepressants, or sympathomimetic agents. In other cases, it may involve using two agents with similar anticholinergic properties.</p><p>Adverse effects of anticholinergics include confusion; hence, they should be used with caution in older adults and those with preexisting cognitive difficulties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-management-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. For such patients, options include the use of antimuscarinics that do not cross the blood-brain barrier (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trospium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trospium</a> chloride) or that selectively block the M3 muscarinic receptor (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=darifenacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">darifenacin</a>), which is not known to be involved in cognition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-urgency-incontinence-overactive-bladder-in-women#H3281666245\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of urgency incontinence/overactive bladder in women&quot;, section on 'Pharmacotherapies'</a>.)</p><p>Botulinum toxin injection is a treatment option for patients with bladder dysfunction due to neurogenic detrusor overactivity who are refractory to or intolerant of <span class=\"nowrap\">anticholinergic/antimuscarinic</span> therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-management-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. There is evidence from several randomized controlled trials of patients with MS or spinal cord injury that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=onabotulinumtoxina-botox-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">onabotulinumtoxinA</a> injections (200 or 300 international units) into the detrusor muscle are more effective than placebo for the outcomes of reducing incontinence episodes and improving quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-management-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. The most common side effects are urinary retention, often resulting in the need to initiate clean intermittent catheterization, and asymptomatic urinary tract infections. Patients selected for onabotulinumtoxinA injection should be willing and able to perform clean intermittent catheterization.</p><p>Detrusor overactivity that is unresponsive to botulinum toxin may benefit from sacral neuromodulation with electrical stimulation of the S3 nerve root as well as peripheral nerve stimulation of the dorsal penile or clitoral nerves&nbsp;and posterior tibial nerve. This treatment inhibits the micturition reflex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-management-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>For patients with failure to empty (eg, detrusor sphincter dyssynergia), alpha antagonist medications such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prazosin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prazosin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=terazosin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">terazosin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxazosin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxazosin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamsulosin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamsulosin</a> may be beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-management-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Clean intermittent catheterization is an option for those with severely impaired emptying.</p><p>Nocturia can be effectively managed with oral or intranasal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-management-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/3,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,11</a>]. Hyponatremia has been reported in about 5 percent of cases. An afternoon dose of a diuretic can lead to a reduction in nighttime frequency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-management-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Common problems include constipation, poor evacuation, and incontinence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults#H2851516956\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features of multiple sclerosis in adults&quot;, section on 'Bowel and bladder dysfunction'</a>.)</p><p>In addition to neurogenic disorders related to MS, other causes of bowel dysfunction include decreased physical activity and mobility, which can impact bowel movement frequency, secondary medical conditions unrelated to MS, and adverse effects of medications used to treat MS-related spasticity, pain, or bladder dysfunction.</p><p>There are several interventions for constipation, including dietary changes to increase fluid and fiber intake, laxatives (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F59746\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59746 \">table 1</a>), and enemas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-management-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/5,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-chronic-constipation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of chronic constipation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Among the laxatives, we suggest bulking agents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F59746\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59746 \">table 1</a>) as first-line treatments because they increase intestinal motility without causing incontinence. Common forms include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psyllium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">psyllium</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylcellulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylcellulose</a>, calcium <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polycarbophil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">polycarbophil</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wheat-dextrin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">wheat dextrin</a>, and wheat bran; among them, we prefer wheat dextrin, which is virtually tasteless once adequately mixed in liquid.</p><p>Other laxatives can be used for patients who have a poor response to fiber or do not tolerate it. Osmotic agents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F59746\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59746 \">table 1</a>) cause intestinal water secretion and thereby increase stool hydration and frequency. This class includes <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium sulfate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-citrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium citrate</a>, polyethylene glycol, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lactulose</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorbitol</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycerin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glycerin</a>. Stimulant laxatives increase intestinal motility and secretions. Agents include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bisacodyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bisacodyl</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=senna-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">senna</a>, cascara, and castor oil; senna is generally preferred over the other stimulant agents due to increased tolerability. Stool softeners include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docusate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docusate</a> sodium and docusate calcium. Docusate sodium 100 mg twice daily combined with a stimulant (eg, senna) can be effective for mild to moderate constipation. Prokinetic agents include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lubiprostone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lubiprostone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=linaclotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">linaclotide</a>. Bisacodyl or glycerin suppositories can be used for patients with dysphagia, nausea, or vomiting. Tap water and soapsuds enemas work quickly to soften stools and assist in expelling the contents of the rectum.</p><p>For patients with fecal incontinence, the initial management involves supportive care and medical therapy. Supportive measures including avoiding foods or activities known to provoke symptoms, and addressing perianal skin hygiene. Medical therapy includes supplementing the diet with a bulking agent (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylcellulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylcellulose</a> 1 to 2 tablespoons per day) to improve stool consistency, and use of the antidiarrheal agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loperamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loperamide</a> to reduce fecal incontinence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fecal-incontinence-in-adults-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fecal incontinence in adults: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Behavioral feedback may be effective for treatment of constipation or fecal incontinence in some patients with MS, especially if they are only mildly to moderately disabled. However, biofeedback is not indicated in patients with substantial loss of rectal sensation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the inability to contract the external anal sphincter. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fecal-incontinence-in-adults-management#H978871679\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fecal incontinence in adults: Management&quot;, section on 'Biofeedback'</a>.)</p><p>For refractory incontinence, additional evaluation with anorectal manometry and endorectal <span class=\"nowrap\">ultrasound/magnetic</span> resonance imaging should be performed to detect functional and structural abnormalities causing fecal incontinence. Surgical intervention (such as colostomy or ileostomy) are an option in severe cases. Quality of life may improve with colostomy because bowel dysfunction can cause embarrassment, pain and discomfort, and augment spasticity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fecal-incontinence-in-adults-management#H294472365\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fecal incontinence in adults: Management&quot;, section on 'Refractory symptoms'</a>.)</p><p>A separate issue involves bowel-related side effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dimethyl-fumarate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dimethyl fumarate</a>, a disease-modifying treatment which may cause diarrhea, nausea, abdominal cramps, and borborygmi. Antimuscarinic agents like <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycopyrrolate-glycopyrronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glycopyrrolate</a> (1 to 2 mg twice a day) can help ameliorate these side effects in some patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Frank dementia is an uncommon feature of MS, but some degree cognitive impairment is frequently present.

In addition, the medication regimen should be scrutinized for drugs that are associated with sedative, hypnotic, or psychomotor-slowing side effects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacologic treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no proven therapies for the treatment of cognitive impairment related to MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-management-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], although the effects of disease-modifying agents for MS and cholinesterase inhibitors have been examined to see if they would have a beneficial impact on cognitive function.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although data are limited, some of the current disease modifying medications, including interferon beta-1a, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=interferon-beta-1b-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">interferon beta-1b</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">natalizumab</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fingolimod-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fingolimod</a>, may slow the progression of cognitive dysfunction in MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-management-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Randomized trials have established the efficacy of these drugs for reducing relapse rates and improving surrogate measures such as MRI parameters in patients with relapsing form of MS (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disease-modifying-treatment-of-relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disease-modifying treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in adults&quot;</a>). However, these trials did not routinely evaluate cognition, and in the trials that did, the results were inconsistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-management-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Much of the evidence suggesting benefit for cognitive outcomes comes from studies with methodologic limitations such as a small sample size, open-label design, or lack of a control group. Therefore, the impact of these disease-modifying therapies on cognitive impairment in MS remains uncertain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cholinesterase inhibitors were initially developed as treatment for patients with Alzheimer disease, a condition associated with a cholinergic deficit in the cortex. There is no known cholinergic deficit associated with MS.

Thus, the most common strategies for managing cognitive difficulties associated with MS require the patient to compensate for these problems and to accommodate them when unable to compensate. A fair amount of assistance from family members, friends, coworkers, and caregivers is frequently needed to enable the patient to compensate and accommodate. As an example, patients often need assistance to maintain a clean and organized home environment.</p><p>There are a number of strategies that may be useful for managing specific types of cognitive problems.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of personal organizers, particularly those with alarms, can be helpful for patients who have difficulty with memory and organization. Written reminders, directions, and phone logs can serve the same purpose.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pacing of activities to manage physical and cognitive fatigue can be quite helpful.

Cognitive training was computer-assisted in some studies, and in others was combined with compensatory strategies including external aids such as calendars, diaries, notebooks, and lists, or internal aids such as visualization and semantic categorization.

Tonic spasticity is characterized by resistance to movement that is rate dependent, while phasic spasticity manifests as involuntary jerks and spasms that principally affect the limbs and are more pronounced at night when attempting to sleep. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults#H1992905453\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features of multiple sclerosis in adults&quot;, section on 'Spasticity'</a>.) &#160;</p><p>The goal of spasticity treatment is to reduce muscle tone to the degree that function is improved, while not compromising safety by abolishing all muscle tone. Documentation of the degree of spasticity and the muscle groups involved should be quantified using the modified Ashworth scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F93413\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93413 \">table 5</a>), a subjective scoring system that ranges from grade 0, which indicates no increase in muscle tone, to grade 4, which indicates &quot;lead pipe&quot; rigidity. </p><p>Oral medications remain the first-line therapy for spasticity in patients with MS. A 2004 systematic review of oral agents concluded that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=baclofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">baclofen</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tizanidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tizanidine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dantrolene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dantrolene</a> were effective compared with placebo, based on a level of evidence considered fair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-management-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Baclofen and tizanidine were roughly equivalent in efficacy and had similar rates of adverse events; tizanidine was more often associated with dry mouth, while baclofen was more often associated with motor weakness. Dantrolene is not commonly used for treating MS spasticity due to its hepatotoxicity.</p><p>Additional options include intrathecal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=baclofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">baclofen</a> infusions (administered through implantable pumps) and botulinum toxin injections. An evidence-based review updated in 2016 by the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) concluded that botulinum toxin is effective for reducing muscle tone and improving passive movement in adults with arm and leg spasticity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-management-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>Nonpharmacologic interventions for spasticity in MS include physiotherapy, structured exercise programs, transcranial magnetic stimulation, electromagnetic therapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and whole body vibration; none are proven effective, though the available evidence is limited and methodologically weak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-management-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>Given these data, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=baclofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">baclofen</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tizanidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tizanidine</a> as initial therapy for spasticity in patients with MS. Among these choices, we prefer baclofen due to its favorable side effect profile and low cost, particularly for patients with predominant tonic spasticity. Baclofen should be initiated at low dose (generally 5 to 10 mg once daily, to twice or three times daily) and titrated slowly up to an effective dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-management-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Rapid titration and very high doses of more than 200 mg a day can be associated with confusion, coma, and seizures. Divided doses up to a total of 80 mg per day may be used, keeping in mind the possible side effects of drowsiness and hypotonicity. Patients should be warned to neither stop nor drastically reduce the dosage of baclofen abruptly. An alternate choice is tizanidine, which may be used alone or in combination with baclofen. Tizanidine is available in 2 mg and 4 mg tablets and may be used in daily divided doses up to 36 mg per day. Patients should be warned about sedation as well as pronounced weakness from excessive tone reduction. </p><p>Benzodiazepines (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonazepam</a>) can be used for patients with predominant phasic spasticity, especially when the symptoms are most prominent at night or at bedtime.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3208280387\"><span class=\"h1\">SPEECH, SWALLOW, AND RESPIRATORY FUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brainstem-related symptoms like dysphagia, dysarthria and respiratory dysfunction (particularly poor cough and inability to clear secretions), may develop in patients with advanced MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-management-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>].
