It is an integral part of general anesthesia, allowing ventilation and oxygenation as well as a mode for anesthetic gas delivery. Major complications of airway management in the operating room are very rare but may be life threatening.</p><p>This topic will discuss the formulation of an airway management strategy for general anesthesia, including plans for the use of mask ventilation, use of supraglottic airway devices (SGA), endotracheal intubation, and the selection of medications for induction of general anesthesia. Techniques and devices for airway management, rapid sequence induction intubation, and management of the difficult airway are discussed separately.

One goal of this evaluation is to predict the degree of difficulty with mask ventilation and endotracheal intubation using standard devices. The plan for airway management follows from this prediction, since in many cases induction of anesthesia will result in airway obstruction and at least temporarily make the patient apneic. In addition, factors that predispose the patient to aspiration during anesthesia should be identified.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H261231832\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who report problems with anesthesia in the past, every effort should be made to obtain and review prior anesthesia records for details of airway management.</p><p>A number of disease states, both congenital and acquired, have been associated with difficult airway management (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F98505\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98505 \">table 1</a>). In addition, pulmonary problems such as asthma, recent upper respiratory infection, pneumonia, bronchitis, or presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may impact oxygenation and ventilation during induction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-for-induction-of-general-anesthesia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Most patients who present for emergency procedures are at increased risk of aspiration during anesthesia, either because of recent oral intake or because of predisposing conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F98506\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98506 \">table 2</a>). In addition, the incidence of difficult intubation is significantly higher in the emergency room and other areas outside of the operating room. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the difficult airway in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H667852815\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of bedside tests and measurements have been developed to evaluate the airway (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F108981\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108981 \">table 3</a>). Though they are and should be routinely used, they are of limited value in predicting difficult mask ventilation and intubation (see <a href=\"#H717871210\" class=\"local\">'Prediction of the difficult airway'</a> below):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>First glance assessment</strong> &ndash; The preoperative first glance assessment provides significant useful information. Obesity, facial hair, a thick, short neck; and neck collars are immediately apparent and suggest potential difficulty with airway management.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mouth opening </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Mouth opening is usually assessed in finger breadths. A mouth opening of less than three finger breadths is considered limited. Patients with temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disease or prior surgery may have very limited mouth opening or trismus. Radiation of the head and face can also result in trismus or scarring that distorts the anatomy or limits mobility.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Dentition should be assessed, with particular attention to the presence of caps, crowns, implants, veneers, dentures, braces, or loose teeth. These should be documented and the risk of damage discussed with the patient. Dentures should ordinarily be removed in the preoperative area before the patient is brought to the operating suite. However, if mask ventilation is planned, dentures may be left in place to improve mask fit, though they should be removed immediately prior to intubation to prevent dislodgement or damage. If the patient has braces, the risk of soft tissue injury to the lips during airway management should be discussed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mallampati class </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Mallampati class was first described in 1985 as a test to predict difficult laryngoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-for-induction-of-general-anesthesia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The Mallampati evaluation originally included three classes based on the ability to view the tonsillar pillars, uvula, and palate with the mouth open and the tongue protruded. The more widely used modified Mallampati class includes a fourth class (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F75229\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75229 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-for-induction-of-general-anesthesia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Class I: The entire tonsillar pillars, uvula, hard and soft palates are visualized</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Class II: Partial uvula and soft palate are visualized</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Class III: Only the soft palate is visualized</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Class IV: No visualization of any structures beyond the tongue</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A Mallampati class 0 has also been described, in which part of the epiglottis can also be seen upon mouth opening in addition to all the class I structures listed above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-for-induction-of-general-anesthesia/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The Mallampati test was initially described with the patient in the sitting position. Studies comparing performance of the test supine with sitting have shown conflicting results, with some reporting an increase in Mallampati class in the supine position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-for-induction-of-general-anesthesia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], some a decrease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-for-induction-of-general-anesthesia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], and some no change [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-for-induction-of-general-anesthesia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Two single-center studies reported that the score in the supine position improved the predictive value for difficult intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-for-induction-of-general-anesthesia/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The original description of the Mallampati test did not specify whether the patient should phonate during the test. Most studies have reported that phonation alters the score and reduces the sensitivity of the test (ie, phonation falsely lowers the Mallampati score) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-for-induction-of-general-anesthesia/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We routinely perform the Mallampati evaluation in the sitting position, and perform the test in the supine position if the patient is unable to sit up. We perform the test without phonation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Thyromental distance </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Thyromental distance (TMD) is the distance between the thyroid cartilage and the mandible, measured in full extension of the neck. Short TMD has been defined as less than 6 cm. Historically, TMD has been used as a rough estimate of the submental space, which is the space that must accommodate the tongue during laryngoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-for-induction-of-general-anesthesia/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sternomental distance </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Sternomental distance is measured between the sternal notch and the mandible, measured in full neck extension. Short sternomental distance is defined as less than 12 cm. This parameter and thyromental distance may be objective surrogates for adequacy of neck extension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-for-induction-of-general-anesthesia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neck range of motion </strong>&ndash; Both neck flexion and extension should be assessed for limitations. Patients with arthritis of the neck, cervical spine disease, or previous spine surgery may have limited neck extension. Studies have shown that neck range of motion decreases with age, and decreased neck extension has been associated with difficulty with airway management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-for-induction-of-general-anesthesia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Patients with restricted neck extension may be more difficult to optimally position for induction of anesthesia and intubation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mandibular protrusion </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Patients are asked to protrude the lower jaw such that the mandibular teeth are in front of the maxillary teeth, as a predictor of the ability to sublux the mandible during laryngoscopy. A more objective, similar measurement is the upper lip bite test (ULBT), which assesses the patient's ability to reach and cover the upper lip with their lower incisors. ULBT grading includes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-for-induction-of-general-anesthesia/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Grade 1: The patient can fully cover the upper lip with lower incisors</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Grade 2: The patient can partially cover the upper lip with lower incisors</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Grade 3: The patient cannot reach the upper lip with lower teeth</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H717871190\"><span class=\"h2\">Advanced methods of airway assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endoscopy and ultrasound have limited application for routine airway assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-for-induction-of-general-anesthesia/abstract/11,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,17</a>]. For patients with known or suspected distortions of airway anatomy, these techniques as well as radiologic imaging may be useful before airway management is undertaken.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Preoperative endoscopy</strong> &ndash; Preoperative airway endoscopy (PEAE), which has been used by otolaryngologists for many years to diagnose airway pathology, can also be used for preoperative airway assessment. Endoscopy provides visualization of internal airway anatomy that cannot be viewed with external tests. Routine PEAE is not indicated for patients undergoing elective surgery unless abnormal airway anatomy is suspected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-for-induction-of-general-anesthesia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ultrasound</strong> &ndash; With increasing availability of bedside ultrasound in the operating room, ultrasound has been used for airway assessment. It can allow visualization of the airway from the mouth to mid-trachea, and can also be used to identify the cricothyroid membrane, visualize the vocal cords, and identify airway pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-for-induction-of-general-anesthesia/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].

The incidence of this life-threatening situation may be even lower with increasing availability and use of video laryngoscopes.

An audit of major complications of airway management from over three million anesthetics in the United Kingdom found twice as many case reports of major complications in obese patients, especially in the morbidly obese [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-for-induction-of-general-anesthesia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Among obese patients, there was an increased frequency of aspiration and other complications with the use of supraglottic airways, difficulty with intubation, and airway obstruction during emergence or recovery from anesthesia. When rescue devices were required, they failed more often than in nonobese patients.

Though this may not be the optimal final position for airway management in a specific patient, it should be the starting point, with modification made as necessary. Obese patients may require a ramped position to open the space between the chin and the chest, and to align the sternal notch with the external auditory meatus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F95285\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef95285 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-for-induction-of-general-anesthesia/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10737491\"><span class=\"h3\">Preoxygenation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients presenting for general anesthesia should be preoxygenated with 100 percent oxygen to increase oxygen reserve and provide additional time to secure the airway. Since the supine position reduces functional residual capacity (FRC), preoxygenation can be performed in the semi-upright position and is especially useful for those with characteristics associated with oxygenation difficulty (eg, the obese patient, the pregnant patient, patients with poor pulmonary reserve) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-for-induction-of-general-anesthesia/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>Preoxygenation is administered for three minutes of normal tidal volume breathing, for eight deep breaths over one minute, or until the fraction of expired oxygen is over 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-for-induction-of-general-anesthesia/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Ultimately, the time to desaturation with apnea will depend on the length of preoxygenation as well as the patient's oxygen consumption and FRC. Desaturation may occur more quickly with apnea despite adequate preoxygenation in patients with poor pulmonary reserve (eg, those with COPD, pulmonary hypertension, severe asthma, lung cancer, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea) or increased oxygen consumption (eg, pregnancy).</p><p>The use of nasal cannula for passive apneic oxygenation during laryngoscopy can prolong the time to desaturation in high-risk patients during airway management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-for-induction-of-general-anesthesia/abstract/53-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-56</a>].

This sequence allows the clinician to prove his or her ability to ventilate the patient before removing the patient's ability to ventilate on his or her own, while maintaining the option to awaken the patient should attempts at airway control fail.</p><p>The need to withhold NMBAs until mask ventilation is established has been questioned, partly because muscle relaxation often makes difficult mask ventilation easier, especially in cases in which difficult ventilation is the result of laryngospasm or light anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-for-induction-of-general-anesthesia/abstract/58-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-60</a>]. However, muscle relaxation can make mask ventilation worse or impossible in patients in whom those factors are not responsible for the difficulty. Assessment of the ability to mask ventilate allows for a change in plan; for example, the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a> rather than a longer acting NMBA if mask ventilation is a struggle, or awakening the patient if possible.

The most common cause was respiratory obstruction.</p><p>Airway complications that may occur during or after extubation include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Upper airway obstruction</strong> &ndash; Can be due to relaxation of airway muscles associated with residual sedation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Laryngospasm, bronchospasm</strong> &ndash; Presence of airway device or airway secretions can lead to airway irritation, especially at light levels of anesthesia as occur on emergence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypoventilation</strong> &ndash; Can be due to residual anesthesia and narcotic medication.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hemodynamic changes </strong>&ndash; Hypertension and tachycardia can occur during extubation with stimulus of airway device, pain, or emergence excitement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Aspiration </strong>&ndash; Secretions or stomach contents may be aspirated while the patient is unable to protect the airway.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Negative pressure pulmonary edema</strong> &ndash; Can occur when the patient attempts to breathe against upper airway obstruction, as with laryngospasm, or when the patient occludes the airway device by biting it with inadequate bite block in place.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Coughing or straining</strong> &ndash; Can disrupt surgical wound with straining, as after hernia repair, or with venous congestion and bleeding, as might occur after facial plastic surgical procedures.</p><p/><p>Any patient who was at particular risk for difficult airway management at the beginning of anesthesia should be considered at risk for airway compromise at the end of the anesthetic. A plan should be developed for extubation, taking into account the difficulty of initial airway management, any ventilatory difficulties during the anesthetic, potential for airway edema because of positioning, or administration of a large volume of intravenous fluid <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> narcotics. The Difficult Airway Society in the United Kingdom has published guidelines for extubation that provide algorithms for extubation planning (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F108985\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108985 \">algorithm 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F108986\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108986 \">algorithm 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F108987\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108987 \">algorithm 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-management-for-induction-of-general-anesthesia/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. In general, patients should be positioned for extubation as close as possible to the way they were positioned for induction, to facilitate airway management should reintubation be necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H717871470\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The preoperative airway assessment should review outcomes with prior anesthesia exposure and record mouth opening and dentition, Mallampati class (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F75229\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75229 \">figure 1</a>), thyromental distance, neck range of motion, and mandibular protrusion. Some disease states, bedside airway examination tests, and patient characteristics may predict difficulty with airway management. (See <a href=\"#H717871210\" class=\"local\">'Prediction of the difficult airway'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The strategy for airway management for general anesthesia depends on the requirements for the planned surgical or diagnostic procedure, patient characteristics that affect airway management, predicted degree of difficulty with airway management, and risk of aspiration. (See <a href=\"#H717871222\" class=\"local\">'Creation of a strategy for airway management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary plan must determine the preferred airway device and intubation technique. There should always be a backup plan, with the equipment and expertise readily available to implement an emergency airway algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F94447\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef94447 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H322259108\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The choice between endotracheal tube (ETT) placement and the use of a supraglottic airway (SGA) depends upon both patient and surgical factors. (See <a href=\"#H717871230\" class=\"local\">'Choice of airway device'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In general, we use SGA for shorter procedures (&lt;3 hours), for patients who are at low risk of aspiration, and for procedures which will not require a prolonged period of muscle relaxation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>ETT is preferred in patients at high risk for aspiration, those that require high inspiratory pressures, and for longer cases requiring muscle relaxation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Airway management with facemask alone may be used for short cases without the surgical need for muscle relaxation if the anesthesiologist will have full access to the patient's airway throughout the case.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A combination of medications is usually used to achieve the depth of anesthesia necessary for induction of anesthesia and airway management. Endotracheal intubation requires a deeper level of anesthesia than supraglottic airway placement. (See <a href=\"#H717871242\" class=\"local\">'Choice of medications for induction and intubation'</a> above.).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient should be positioned for optimal airway management (eg, &quot;sniffing position&quot; with ramp, if necessary) and preoxygenated with 100 percent oxygen delivered by mask for three minutes of normal tidal volume breathing, for eight deep breaths over one minute, or until the fraction of expired oxygen is over 90 percent. (See <a href=\"#H10737465\" class=\"local\">'Preparation for induction of anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After induction of anesthesia, the ability to mask ventilate should be proven prior to the administration of neuromuscular blocking agents, unless a rapid sequence induction is planned. (See <a href=\"#H322256915\" class=\"local\">'Administration of neuromuscular blocking agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After placement of an airway device, proper position must be confirmed by auscultation of the chest and the presence of an end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> waveform. If confirmation is not possible, the airway device should be adjusted or replaced. (See <a href=\"#H677254929\" class=\"local\">'Confirmation of airway placement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any patient who was at particular risk for difficult airway management at the beginning of anesthesia should be considered at risk for airway compromise at the end of the anesthetic. Airway management should include a plan for safe emergence and extubation. (See <a href=\"#H322257103\" class=\"local\">'Extubation'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Rosenblatt WH, Sukhupragarn W.
