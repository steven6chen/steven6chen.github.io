The class III drugs block IKr, the rapid component of the cardiac delayed rectifier potassium current. This results in prolonged repolarization, increased action potential duration, and lengthening of the refractory period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-of-ibutilide/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Ibutilide increases the refractoriness of atrial and ventricular myocardium, the atrioventricular node, His-Purkinje system, and accessory pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-of-ibutilide/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In addition, ibutilide activates a slow, delayed inward sodium current that occurs early during repolarization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-of-ibutilide/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>].

There is no effect on the PR interval or QRS duration.</p><p>The degree of QT prolongation associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibutilide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibutilide</a> is related to the dose, the rate of infusion, and the serum concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-of-ibutilide/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Prolongation of the QT interval provides the substrate for torsades de pointes (TdP), a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. The QT interval returns to baseline within two to four hours after stopping the infusion. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Proarrhythmia'</a> below and <a href=\"#H5117694\" class=\"local\">'Discontinuing ibutilide infusion'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H106434349\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism of proarrhythmic effect</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Like other drugs that prolong the QT interval and cause torsades de pointes, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibutilide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibutilide</a> blocks IKr, the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current that is responsible for phase 3 repolarization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-of-ibutilide/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. IKr results from a heteromeric complex formed by a tetrameric potassium channel encoded by the KCNH2 gene (formerly called HERG gene) in complex with an accessory subunit encoded by the MirP1 gene (KCNE2). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-long-qt-syndrome-definitions-causes-and-pathophysiology#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired long QT syndrome: Definitions, causes, and pathophysiology&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibutilide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ibutilide</a> exhibits &quot;reverse use dependence&quot;, which is defined as an inverse correlation between the heart rate and QT interval. As a result, the QT interval decreases as the heart rate increases and lengthens as the heart rate slows. This explains why drug-induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) is more commonly seen with bradycardia.</p><p>The effect of heart rate may be mediated by changes in the local extracellular potassium concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-of-ibutilide/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Lower heart rates result in less potassium moving out of the cell during repolarization (before subsequent reuptake by the Na-K-ATPase pump), since there are fewer repolarizations. The associated reduction in extracellular potassium concentration enhances the degree of drug-induced inhibition of IKr, increasing the QT interval.

It is extensively metabolized by the liver to eight metabolites. Only one metabolite exhibits antiarrhythmic activity, but its level is only approximately 10 percent of the parent drug level. As a result, this metabolite plays no role in the efficacy of ibutilide. Although almost 90 percent of the drug or its metabolites are detected in the urine, only 7 percent is excreted as the native, active drug.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5117183\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL USES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibutilide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ibutilide</a> is approved for the acute termination of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter of recent onset. Since there is no oral preparation of ibutilide, it has no role in the long-term prevention of these arrhythmias. Ibutilide is not approved for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias, and its efficacy for these arrhythmias is unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5117190\"><span class=\"h2\">Atrial fibrillation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibutilide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibutilide</a> is useful and effective for the pharmacologic cardioversion of recent-onset atrial fibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-of-ibutilide/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Ibutilide successfully restored sinus rhythm in 71 percent of arrhythmia episodes, with success during the first administration in 12 of 19 (63 percent). Fourteen episodes in six patients required electrical cardioversion after ibutilide failed. There were no episodes of symptomatic bradycardia, and only one episode each of polymorphic and monomorphic ventricular tachycardia.

Two cohort studies have shown that the concurrent administration of magnesium (doses of four to five grams administered intravenously) with ibutilide is associated with a greater chance of successful chemical conversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-of-ibutilide/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].

There is no effect on the PR interval or QRS duration. Prolongation of the QT interval provides the substrate for torsades de pointes (TdP), a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.
