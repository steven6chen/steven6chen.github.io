The World Health Organization (WHO) has defined diagnostic thresholds for low bone mass and osteoporosis based upon bone mineral density (BMD) measurements compared with a young adult reference population (T-score) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F74190\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74190 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The initial osteoporosis evaluation includes a history to assess for clinical risk factors for fracture and to evaluate for other conditions that contribute to bone loss, a physical examination, and basic laboratory tests. There are many coexisting medical conditions that contribute to bone loss (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F60440\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60440 \">table 2</a>). Thus, evaluation for alternative causes of bone loss to detect potentially reversible causes should be considered in those with abnormal initial findings.</p><p>Early diagnosis and quantification of bone loss and fracture risk have become more important because of the availability of therapies that can slow or even reverse the progression of osteoporosis.</p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of osteoporosis in men will be reviewed here. The treatment and the epidemiology and etiology of osteoporosis in men are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-osteoporosis-in-men\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of osteoporosis in men&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiology-of-osteoporosis-in-men\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiology of osteoporosis in men&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Osteoporosis has no clinical manifestations until there is a fracture. Many vertebral fractures are asymptomatic. They may be diagnosed as an incidental finding on chest or abdominal radiographs. The clinical manifestations of symptomatic vertebral fractures include pain and height loss. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporotic-thoracolumbar-vertebral-compression-fractures-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteoporotic thoracolumbar vertebral compression fractures: Clinical manifestations and treatment&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Men may also have symptoms of disorders that are known to cause osteoporosis, such as hypogonadism, malabsorption, and hyperparathyroidism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F60440\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60440 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiology-of-osteoporosis-in-men\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiology of osteoporosis in men&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Osteoporosis is characterized by low bone mass with microarchitectural disruption and skeletal fragility, resulting in an increased risk of fracture, particularly at the spine, hip, wrist, humerus, rib, and pelvis. Bone density measurements are obtained infrequently in men, and therefore, the diagnosis of osteoporosis is often made as a result of low-trauma fractures or radiographic osteopenia detected by chance or during evaluation for unrelated reasons.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bone mineral density (BMD)</strong> &ndash; The bone densitometry definition of osteoporosis in men is not as well standardized as it is in postmenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-osteoporosis-in-men/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, as in women, BMD measurements are useful for predicting osteoporotic fractures in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-osteoporosis-in-men/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. For every standard deviation reduction in BMD, men have a relative risk of fracture that is similar to, or even greater than, the relative risk in women. In contrast, the age-specific prevalence of osteoporosis and fracture is lower in men than in women, and therefore, men have a lower absolute risk for fracture than women at any bone density T-score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-osteoporosis-in-men/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteoporotic fracture risk assessment&quot;, section on 'Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA)'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Age &ge;50 years</strong> &ndash; Based upon the similar relationship between BMD and fracture in men and women, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends using the same classification of BMD to define osteoporosis in men (age 50 and older) as in women (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F74190\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74190 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-osteoporosis-in-men/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

The International Society for Clinical Densitometry (ISCD) changed their position to be concordant with the WHO, with both organizations now recommending the use of a female reference database for men. However, many centers in the United States continue to use sex-specific reference databases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-osteoporosis-in-men/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In this scenario, osteoporosis in men is defined by a value for BMD 2.5 or more standard deviations below the young healthy male reference mean (rather than female reference mean). We have chosen this approach because all of the randomized trials of osteoporosis treatment in men recruited subjects based on T-scores calculated using male normal controls, and therefore, we have treatment efficacy data in this population. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-dual-energy-x-ray-absorptiometry#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry&quot;, section on 'Reference databases'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Age &lt;50 years</strong> &ndash; The ISCD recommends that BMD measurements alone should not be used to define osteoporosis in men younger than 50 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-osteoporosis-in-men/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In men below age 50 years with low BMD (Z-score &le;-2.0), we diagnose osteoporosis if there is a history of a fragility fracture and, possibly, if other risk factors for osteoporosis (such as glucocorticoid therapy, hypogonadism, or hyperparathyroidism) are present.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CANDIDATES FOR BONE DENSITY TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the absence of data supporting routine bone mineral density (BMD) testing in men above a certain age, we suggest not performing routine testing in men.

Screening for osteoporosis, including recommendations by expert groups, is reviewed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-osteoporosis#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for osteoporosis&quot;, section on 'Candidates for BMD testing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Skeletal site to measure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fracture risk can be predicted by measurement or estimation of BMD at many skeletal sites. However, the preferred site for measurement of bone density and the number of sites to measure are debatable and may vary according to the clinical situation. This topic is discussed in greater detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-osteoporosis#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for osteoporosis&quot;, section on 'Skeletal site to measure'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteoporotic fracture risk assessment&quot;, section on 'Skeletal site to measure'</a>.)</p><p>In men who are candidates for BMD testing, we suggest dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurements of the spine and hip because fractures at these sites have the greatest impact on patients' health. Measurement of hip BMD also has the highest predictive value for hip fracture. In addition, if pharmacologic therapy is planned, measurement of spine BMD is useful as it shows less variability and can detect responses to therapy earlier than hip BMD. We make the diagnosis according to the lowest T-score measured.</p><p>Osteophytes and vascular calcifications are common in aging men and often interfere with the assessment of BMD at this site. In this setting, measurement of hip BMD alone is sufficient. If degenerative changes limit interpretation of BMD measurements of both the spine and hip, forearm DXA should be assessed. In addition, forearm BMD measurements may be more sensitive for bone loss in men who are undergoing androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-osteoporosis-in-men/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In men with clinical manifestations of osteoporosis (low trauma fracture) or with low bone mass by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) (T-score less than -2.0), an initial evaluation for secondary causes of osteoporosis (such as renal or liver disease, hyperparathyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, celiac disease and other forms of malabsorption, or idiopathic hypercalciuria) should be performed.</p><p>Sometimes, the initial history and physical examination will provide an explanation for low bone mass (eg, hypogonadism, glucocorticoid excess). The initial evaluation should also include routine biochemical tests to uncover renal or hepatic disease, a complete blood count, serum testosterone, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (calcidiol), and 24-hour urine calcium and creatinine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F51140\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51140 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>Men who have abnormalities on the initial laboratory testing, have suspicious findings on history and physical examination, or who have unexplained low bone mass after the initial evaluation may also require additional laboratory tests (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F51140\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51140 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>These studies may include measurement of:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parathyroid hormone to screen for primary hyperparathyroidism &ndash; We typically measure this in men with hypercalcemia.
