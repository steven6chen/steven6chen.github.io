Thus, most affected individuals present in the setting of a family with a strong history of gout and inherited kidney disease. Previously, many of these families were undiagnosed and uncertain of the cause of inherited kidney disease. Increasingly, families are aware of the UKD diagnosis. The most common clinical presentations of UKD are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Precocious gout &ndash; Affected individuals may develop gout in their teenage years. Gout in this condition is caused by hyperuricemia resulting from a reduced FEUA. As there is usually a strong family history of gout and kidney disease, parents are quick to identify the gout and usually refer their child for further testing.

If performed, a kidney biopsy reveals nonspecific tubulointerstitial fibrosis. The age of onset of CKD in such patients is highly variable.

However, gout in UKD often has an earlier age of onset, sometimes in the teenage years. Women with UKD are also frequently affected by gout. As an example, in a series of 205 patients from 31 affected families with UKD, 65 percent had gout, although this feature was absent in some families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autosomal-dominant-tubulointerstitial-kidney-disease-medullary-cystic-kidney-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>Asymptomatic hyperuricemia is even more frequent. It can often be detected during childhood if testing is performed early because of a positive family history.

All were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a> before the onset of gout, and the efficacy of therapy appeared to depend upon when the drug was initiated.

It is the only ADTKD subtype for which a specific treatment is available; the clinical manifestations resemble those found in other low-renin states. (See <a href=\"#H166039034\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation of ADTKD-REN'</a> below.)</p><p>ADTKD due to<em> REN</em> mutations (ADTKD-REN) has also been referred to as familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy type 2 (FJHN2). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H166039013\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics of ADTKD-REN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ADTKD-REN is caused by mutations in the <em>REN</em> gene on chromosome 1 that encodes renin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autosomal-dominant-tubulointerstitial-kidney-disease-medullary-cystic-kidney-disease/abstract/5,6,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,44</a>]. To date, 10 families with <em>REN</em> mutations causing this disorder have been described, all with mutations in the signal sequence of preprorenin. Mutations in this signal sequence disrupt the translocation of preprorenin into the endoplasmic reticulum of renin-expressing cells. (See <a href=\"#H166039027\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis of ADTKD-REN'</a> below.)</p><p>ADTKD-REN, like other types of ADTKD, is autosomal dominant; clinically affected individuals have one normal gene and one abnormal gene. The parent of an affected individual is affected, and there is a 50 percent chance that the children of an affected individual will have the condition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H166039027\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis of ADTKD-REN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Renin is expressed in multiple segments of the renal tubule, including the juxtaglomerular complex. In these cells, preprorenin is translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum, where it is converted to prorenin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autosomal-dominant-tubulointerstitial-kidney-disease-medullary-cystic-kidney-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Some prorenin is secreted, while the remainder is targeted to lysozymes where it is further cleaved to active renin. Mutations that disrupt the signal sequence of prorenin prevent proper translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in accumulation of preprorenin in the cytoplasm of renin-producing cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autosomal-dominant-tubulointerstitial-kidney-disease-medullary-cystic-kidney-disease/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. </p><p>The mutation in one of the renin genes results in decreased production of renin. In addition, the cells producing renin are damaged due to intracellular accumulation of the abnormal renin, further decreasing production of the hormone. Renin levels in affected patients are low, although they may rise into the low-normal range during periods of stress. The low-renin state produces characteristic clinical findings.

The anemia responds to treatment with erythropoietin. <br/><br/>The anemia precedes the development of CKD and is thought to result from decreased levels of angiotensin, as has been noted in some patients taking angiotensin inhibitors.

Other patients who are symptomatic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> have lower hemoglobin levels should be treated with erythropoietin.</p><p>Patients tend to have low-normal blood pressures and mild hyperkalemia. Some of the patients may be symptomatic with the low blood pressure readings. Low blood pressure and hyperkalemia respond well to treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludrocortisone</a>. The increase in blood pressure also results in hemodynamic improvements and, consequently, an increase in the glomerular filtration rate and a lowering of the serum creatinine. A high-sodium diet can be employed as an alternative to fludrocortisone therapy. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fludrocortisone</a> and a high-sodium diet may also preserve kidney function, although this is hypothetical. Patients with this disorder develop CKD due to intracellular deposition of abnormal renin and subsequent tubular cell death. Thus, eliminating stimuli to renin production (eg, by using a mineralocorticoid receptor agonist and a high-sodium diet) could theoretically suppress synthesis of preprorenin and therefore diminish the accumulation of abnormal renin in cells. (See <a href=\"#H166039027\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis of ADTKD-REN'</a> above.) </p><p>Because patients with ADTKD-REN have a low-renin state with reduced activity of the renin-angiotensin system (similar to patient receiving ACE inhibitors), it is important to avoid the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and to avoid placing these patients on a low-sodium diet. Children with this disorder are often seen by nephrologists, nurses, and dietitians who are in the habit of prescribing a low-sodium diet to patients with CKD. However, a low-sodium diet can cause hypotension and hyperkalemia and can predispose to acute kidney injury.</p><p>Kidney transplantation is effective in this disorder, with resolution of the clinical manifestations, even though renin is produced in other areas of the body besides the kidney.

Prior to the discovery of <em>MUC1</em> as the responsible gene, mapping of families with MKD pointed to this region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autosomal-dominant-tubulointerstitial-kidney-disease-medullary-cystic-kidney-disease/abstract/46-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-51</a>]. It appears that most affected individuals have a single cytosine insertion into one variable-number tandem repeat sequence within the <em>MUC1</em> coding region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autosomal-dominant-tubulointerstitial-kidney-disease-medullary-cystic-kidney-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This mutation results in an abnormal mucin-1 protein that localizes intracellularly in the loop of Henle, distal tubule, and collecting duct, as well as in the apical membrane of the collecting duct. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15602227\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis of MKD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathophysiology of the renal findings in patients with MKD is not understood. However, knockout studies in mice indicate that mucin-1 may not be an essential protein; therefore, it is possible that the <em>MUC1</em> mutation in affected patients has a dominant negative or gain-of-function effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autosomal-dominant-tubulointerstitial-kidney-disease-medullary-cystic-kidney-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Mucin-1 is produced in the breast, skin, gastrointestinal tract, and respiratory system. It is unclear why the clinical phenotype resulting from <em>MUC1</em> mutation is manifest only in the kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autosomal-dominant-tubulointerstitial-kidney-disease-medullary-cystic-kidney-disease/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15602245\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation of MKD</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H478021005\"><span class=\"h3\">Autosomal dominant CKD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary manifestation of <em>MUC1</em> mutation is progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) that follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Many members of the family suffer from kidney disease, with a parent of an affected individual almost always having kidney disease, and approximately 50 percent of children of an affected individual having CKD.</p><p>Some patients develop hyperuricemia and gout; however, unlike uromodulin kidney disease (UKD) and ADTKD due to<em> REN</em> mutations (ADTKD-REN), gout is a late manifestation, and the hyperuricemia is proportional to the degree of kidney dysfunction. </p><p>As a result, most patients with <em>MUC1</em> mutations present in one of two ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They present with an unexplained elevated serum creatinine level during laboratory testing performed for other reasons, or they have unexplained progressive CKD. The urinalysis is relatively bland, without hematuria or significant proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autosomal-dominant-tubulointerstitial-kidney-disease-medullary-cystic-kidney-disease/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. A renal ultrasound typically reveals normal kidneys, although the kidneys may be small in size if the CKD is advanced. The renal ultrasound may or may not detect medullary cysts, which are neither sensitive nor specific for this disorder. Patients presenting in this way frequently have family members with kidney disease of unknown etiology.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They are members of a family in which many individuals are already known to have inherited CKD, and they come forward for screening to determine whether or not they are affected. Increasingly, family members are aware of a diagnosis of MKD in their families and present for screening while asymptomatic.</p><p/><p>The course of CKD in affected families can be highly variable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autosomal-dominant-tubulointerstitial-kidney-disease-medullary-cystic-kidney-disease/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In a study of 72 patients from six Cypriot families, for example, some had CKD noted during the teenage years with development of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) before age 30 years, while other patients had only moderate renal dysfunction into their 60s. Similar variability was noted in a study of five families from Finland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autosomal-dominant-tubulointerstitial-kidney-disease-medullary-cystic-kidney-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In one family, symptoms began before age 30 years, and ESRD or death occurred between the ages of 25 and 33 years. In another family, ESRD or death occurred between the ages of 34 and 55 years. One carrier died at age 64 years with no symptoms or signs of kidney disease. </p><p>As mentioned above, hyperuricemia and gout are not early findings, which helps to distinguish this disease from UKD and ADTKD-REN. However, as kidney function declines, the risk of gout increases, but the increased risk is not out of proportion to the degree of renal dysfunction. As an example, in the study of 72 affected individuals from six Cypriot families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autosomal-dominant-tubulointerstitial-kidney-disease-medullary-cystic-kidney-disease/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>], hyperuricemia (defined as a serum uric acid above 7.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [416 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L]</span> in males and 6.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [357 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L]</span> in females) was present in 12 percent of patients with a creatinine clearance of 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> or higher, 45 percent in patients with a creatinine clearance 11 to 79 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and 81 percent in patients with a creatinine clearance less than 11 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>The prevalence of hypertension is also related to kidney function.

In addition to progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD), this disorder is characterized by gout occurring at an early age (sometimes even in the teenage years) in many, but not all, affected individuals. UKD is the most common subtype, accounting for the majority of cases of ADTKD. (See <a href=\"#H628117470\" class=\"local\">'Uromodulin kidney disease (UKD)'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>ADTKD due to<em> REN</em> mutations (ADTKD-REN) &ndash; ADTKD-REN, which is due to mutations in the <em>REN</em> gene, produces progressive CKD, low or low-normal blood pressures, anemia that occurs in childhood before the onset of CKD, mild hyperkalemia, and hyperuricemia. This is the rarest subtype of ADTKD.

It accounts for about 30 percent of ADTKD.

The diagnosis is confirmed through genetic testing. There is no specific therapy available for UKD. Treatment includes management of gout with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor as well as management of progressive CKD. Many such patients are treated with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, even if they do not have gout, for prevention of progressive CKD, although data supporting this approach are weak. (See <a href=\"#H341953948\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis of UKD'</a> above and <a href=\"#H341954671\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of UKD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A presumptive diagnosis of ADTKD-REN can be made based upon clinical manifestations (a child with unexplained anemia, a history of acute kidney injury, or CKD in conjunction with hyperkalemia, low or low-normal blood pressure, and hyperuricemia) and a strong family history of CKD. The diagnosis is confirmed through genetic testing. Treatment of anemia in ADTKD-REN depends upon whether or not the patient is symptomatic. Some affected individuals do well with a hemoglobin between 10 and 11 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> and do not require therapy. Other patients who are symptomatic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> have lower hemoglobin levels should be treated with erythropoietin.
