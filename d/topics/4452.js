The primary symptoms in patients with LQTS include syncope, seizures, and cardiac arrest. This syndrome is associated with an increased risk of a characteristic life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia known as torsades de pointes or &quot;twisting of the points&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73827\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef73827 \">waveform 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>LQTS may be congenital or acquired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-diagnosis/abstract/1,3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3-7</a>]. Mutations in at least 17 genes have been identified thus far in patients with congenital LQTS; the distinct genetic subtypes are designated LQT1 through LQT17 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F114927\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114927 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Acquired LQTS usually results from undesired QT prolongation and potential for QT-triggered arrhythmias by either QT-prolonging disease states, QT-prolonging medications (<a href=\"http://www.crediblemeds.org/&amp;token=8WmZyxtCPDhnIAxHBR5GfCS/LFztSmi78YK7mOv2rDsc/51VPZuafzJvpcViVbjW&amp;TOPIC_ID=1053\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.crediblemeds.org</a>), or QT-prolonging electrolyte disturbances (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57431\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57431 \">table 2</a>).

A QTc &gt;470 milliseconds at two through five minutes of recovery is highly suggestive of LQT1.

The personal clinical history should focus on signs and symptoms suggestive of tachyarrhythmia, particularly ventricular tachyarrhythmias, as many LQTS families have pre-sudden death warning signs including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Syncope suggestive of cardiac origin (ie, not vasovagal syncope)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Syncope with seizures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resuscitated sudden cardiac arrest</p><p/><p>Additionally, obtaining a multi-generation family history, and utilizing a genetic counsellor when available, is also crucial to establishing the clinical likelihood of congenital LQTS. Key family history items that increase the likelihood of congenital LQTS include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Premature sudden deaths (&lt;40 years of age and autopsy negative)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unexplained motor vehicle accidents</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unexplained drownings</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Generalized seizures (frequently, patients with LQTS have been diagnosed with, and treated for, epilepsy)</p><p/><p>After obtaining the clinical and family history and reviewing the results of the resting, ambulatory, and stress ECGs, the LQTS diagnostic score can be calculated. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'12-lead ECG'</a> below and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Ambulatory ECG monitoring'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3346885055\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">12-lead ECG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients being evaluated for congenital LQTS should have a 12-lead ECG performed. The QT interval should be measured manually on serial ECGs using multiple leads (preferably leads II and V5) and then corrected for heart rate. Once consistent QTc prolongation has been shown on two ECGs (on occasion even one ECG is sufficient), serial ECG testing can be discontinued. The point at which serial ECG testing can be discontinued is highly variable, depending upon the patient&rsquo;s age, growth patterns, and the significance of previous ECG findings. Even after the diagnosis of LQTS is established, most pediatric patients with LQTS will have an annual 12-lead ECG performed. If low-risk and asymptomatic, most adults with LQTS will continue to have periodic cardiac re-evaluations every one to five years.</p><p>In addition, beat-to-beat variability and respiratory sinus arrhythmia affect formulas used to correct for heart rate. As a result, several successive beats may on occasion need to be measured and averaged for each ECG. (See <a href=\"#H3406673\" class=\"local\">'QT rate correction'</a> below and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Special circumstances'</a> below.)</p><p>Prolongation of the QTc is an essential component of the diagnosis of LQTS. However, the QTc varies in response to a number of factors, such as autonomic state, electrolyte imbalance, drugs, and diurnal changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-diagnosis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. </p><p>Other ECG features, such as T wave morphology and bradycardia, may be useful in the evaluation of the patient with suspected LQTS, but the corrected QT interval appears to be the most useful diagnostic and prognostic parameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">General ECG principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The QT interval reflects the time required for both depolarization (the QRS complex) and repolarization (the T wave) of the ventricles. Repolarization is a larger component of the entire QT interval, and QT prolongation is generally considered to reflect abnormalities of repolarization.</p><p>The QT interval varies inversely with the heart rate; therefore, the QT measurement is adjusted for the heart rate, resulting in the corrected QT interval, or QTc. (See <a href=\"#H3406673\" class=\"local\">'QT rate correction'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measuring the QT interval &ndash; The computer-derived QTc should always be confirmed or corrected manually. The QT interval is measured from the onset of the QRS complex to the point at which the T wave ends (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77018\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef77018 \">waveform 1</a>). Accurate measurements can be technically challenging, largely due to difficulties in determining the precise termination of the T wave. The QT interval should be measured in different beats and in several leads. The technique of measuring the QT interval is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-st-and-t-wave-changes#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: ST and T wave changes&quot;, section on 'Prolonged Q-T interval'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impact of U waves &ndash; Identifying the termination of the T wave can be particularly difficult when a U wave is present. The U wave should not be included if it is distinct from and smaller than the T wave. Erroneous inclusion of the U wave in the QT interval measurement can lead to overdiagnosis of LQTS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Which lead should be used? &ndash; QT intervals vary significantly among leads [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Most normal reference ranges are based upon measurements from lead II, and lead V5 is often favored because of the clarity of T wave termination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-diagnosis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Additionally, some experts find leads V2 and V3 to be very useful, since QT measurements are typically the longest in these leads [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-diagnosis/abstract/12,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14</a>]. Other experts, however, avoid measuring the QT interval in leads V2 and V3, particularly in adolescents and children in whom a U wave is frequently present, making it more difficult to precisely determine the point of T wave termination.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3406673\"><span class=\"h3\">QT rate correction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Under normal circumstances, the duration of repolarization depends upon the heart rate. The QT interval is longer at slower rates and shorter at faster rates. For this reason, formulas have been developed to &quot;correct&quot; the QT interval for heart rate (or the duration of the RR interval), although none is ideal (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-qt-interval-correction-ekg\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-diagnosis/abstract/8,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,15-17</a>]. The most commonly used rate correction formula was developed by Bazett [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]: </p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;QTc = QT interval &divide; &radic;RR interval (in sec)</p></div></div><p>Although this approach is simple and generally accurate, it is less accurate at heart rate extremes and results in overcorrecting at high heart rates and undercorrecting at low heart rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Normative values are available for newborns and older children, which are standardized by age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4256375483\"><span class=\"h3\">Normal QTc ranges</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overall, the average QTc in healthy persons after puberty is 420&plusmn;20 milliseconds, while during infancy the average QTc is 400&plusmn;20 milliseconds. By contrast, the average QTc among patients with genetically confirmed LQTS is approximately 470 milliseconds, although patients with confirmed LQTS can have a wide range of QTc values. </p><p>In general, the 99th percentile QTc values are 460 milliseconds (prepuberty), 470 milliseconds in postpubertal males, and 480 milliseconds in postpubertal females. Asymptomatic patients who incidentally exceed these values on serial ECGs, and do not have any acquired QT-prolonging factors, should be evaluated further for the possibility of congenital LQTS as they now have a 10 percent chance of having LQTS (rather than the 1 in 2000 chance that they had prior to getting an ECG). Further, for asymptomatic children with an otherwise idiopathic QTc &gt;480 milliseconds and asymptomatic adults with an otherwise idiopathic QTc &gt;500 milliseconds, LQTS genetic testing is a class I indication since at these thresholds, LQTS is more likely for that patient than merely being an extreme QTc outlier. Further, patients with a QTc &gt;500 milliseconds are at increased risk of sudden death. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Genetic testing'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Special circumstances</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the methodologic and technical challenges discussed above, QT measurement and interpretation is complicated in the following situations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrial fibrillation (AF) &ndash; Due to the irregular changes in the RR interval, the QT interval can vary on a beat-to-beat basis during AF. To accommodate this variability, some clinicians recommend averaging the measurements over 10 beats. Others advise measuring the QT intervals that follow the longest and shortest RR intervals in the ECG, then dividing each by the square root of the preceding RR interval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The average of these two values is then used as the corrected QT interval. Still others find the measurement of QT and QTc in AF to be completely unreliable and instead focus on the look of repolarization (T wave morphology characteristics) rather than trying to measure the length of repolarization in AF. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sinus arrhythmia &ndash; Similarly, in cases with marked RR variability, the QT rate correction formulas may not be as accurate, and taking an average of multiple beats can reduce the variation due to respiratory sinus arrhythmia. Another approach in such patients is to attempt to identify beats which are further away from any longer pauses and measure the QT in those beats. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>QRS prolongation &ndash; QT prolongation usually reflects abnormal repolarization, but when depolarization (the QRS complex) is abnormal and prolonged, the significance of mild QT prolongation is uncertain. It has been suggested that measurement of the JT interval (defined as the QT interval minus the QRS duration) may be a more appropriate way to identify abnormalities in repolarization in such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The normal JTc is less than 360 milliseconds in children without LQTS and is typically greater than 360 milliseconds in children with LQTS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, the validity of using the JT interval in this manner has been questioned. An alternative approach is to adjust the QT interval as a linear function to account for QRS duration and heart rate in the setting of ventricular conduction delay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Another approach is to use a threshold of 500 milliseconds for a prolonged QTc in the setting of a wide QRS complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, this threshold will result in an overdiagnosis of LQTS. Importantly, patients with congenital LQTS almost never have concomitantly prolonged QRS values. Recalling JT interval norms is also problematic. Instead, a simple wide QRS adjustment formula can be used: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Wide QRS adjusted QTc = QTc &ndash; [QRS &ndash; 100]</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Other ECG features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The T waves of patients with congenital LQTS are frequently abnormal with a biphasic contour or a prominent notched component. However, this finding is fairly insensitive, and the absence of an abnormal T wave morphology does not exclude patients from having congenital LQTS. In one report, notched or biphasic T waves were present in 62 percent of patients with LQTS compared with 15 percent of control subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. A variety of other atypical T wave shapes have also been described in LQTS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In experienced hands, T wave morphology, when coupled with knowledge about arrhythmia triggers, may suggest a particular phenotype, but the presence or absence of T wave abnormalities does not alter the diagnostic evaluation in any notable way.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2422904898\"><span class=\"h2\">Exercise testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In nearly all patients (ie, those who are old enough to cooperate and are capable of performing an exercise protocol) with known or suspected congenital LQTS, we perform an exercise (treadmill or bicycle) ECG stress test as part of the initial diagnostic evaluation. Additionally, for patients diagnosed with congenital LQTS, we repeat an exercise ECG stress test annually as part of the ongoing follow-up. The stress test is often used to assess the adequacy of beta blockade by noting a measureable reduction in their maximum heart rate. However, there is no particular threshold of peak heart rate reduction (ie, 20 percent, 25 percent, 30 percent, etc) that guarantees protection from ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Instead, this assessment at least confirms that reasonable levels of beta blocker in the system have been achieved. The response to ECG testing in patients with suspected congenital LQTS is frequently subtle and complex, requiring a high degree of aptitude to correctly interpret and diagnose the findings. If doubt exists surrounding the interpretation or implication of ECG findings post-exercise, the patient should be referred to a clinician with specific expertise and experience with congenital LQTS.</p><p>ECG stress testing in patients with suspected congenital LQTS is performed to assess for exercise-associated arrhythmias, changes in T wave morphology, and the presence of maladaptive QT response during the recovery phase. Physiologically, the QT interval shortens with exercise and with increased heart rate. By contrast, in individuals with LQT1, the QT interval may fail to shorten or may lengthen with exertion and at higher heart rates, and may be prolonged during the recovery phase after exercise.</p><p>At least part of the variability in the response to exercise in LQTS patients results from different responses among the major types of congenital LQTS:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with LQT1 have diminished shortening of the QT interval and a reduced chronotropic response during exercise followed by exaggerated lengthening of the QT interval as the heart rate declines during early and late (eg, one and four minutes) recovery after exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-diagnosis/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. This is due to the fact that their mutations impair the function of the Kv7.1 outward-rectifying potassium channels, which contributes to shortening the action potential during sympathetic activation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many patients with LQT2 have marked QT interval shortening and a normal chronotropic response during exercise, although there are exceptions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-diagnosis/abstract/24,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,27</a>]. There is exaggerated lengthening of the QT interval as the heart rate declines during late recovery (eg, four minutes) after exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-diagnosis/abstract/24,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26</a>].</p><p/><p>These characteristics may explain the observation that many cardiac events occur during exercise in LQT1 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64239\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64239 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Among 169 patients identified as LQT1 genotype positive who underwent standard exercise testing and achieved similar maximal heart rate and workloads, those with prior cardiac events had a significantly greater heart rate recovery during the first minute following exercise compared with those without prior events (19 versus 13 beats per minute in a 47 patient South African cohort; 27 versus 20 beats per minute in a 122 patient Italian cohort) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-diagnosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Greater heart rate reductions immediately following exercise in persons positive for the LQT1 genotype appear to risk stratify them at a higher risk of arrhythmic events.</p><p>The response of QTc during exercise recovery may be helpful in identifying LQTS in asymptomatic relatives of individuals with LQTS as well as in identifying probands [].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supine QTc:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If &ge;470 milliseconds in males or &ge;480 milliseconds in females with personal or family history suspicious for LQTS, then the patient has high probability LQTS (estimated at &gt;90 percent likelihood).

We proceed with genetic testing in the following instances:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a high clinical suspicion of congenital LQTS based on history, family history, ECG findings, and results of any additional testing, such as a high Schwartz score &ge;3.5 (Class I recommendation).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with an intermediate clinical suspicion of congenital LQTS based on history, family history, ECG findings, and results of any additional testing, such as an intermediate Schwartz score of 1.5 to 3 (Class II recommendation).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymptomatic patients without a family history of congenital LQTS but who have serial ECGs with QTc &ge;480 milliseconds before puberty or &ge;500 milliseconds post-puberty (Class I recommendation). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymptomatic patients without a family history of congenital LQTS but who have serial ECGs with QTc &ge;460 milliseconds before puberty or &ge;480 milliseconds post-puberty (Class II recommendation).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Cascade/mutation-specific</span> testing of all appropriate relatives when the disease-causative mutation has been identified in the proband (Class I recommendation). This generally proceeds in concentric circles of relatedness. For example, if the LQTS-causative mutation was paternally inherited, then the paternal aunts and uncles are tested first rather than testing them and the cousins at the same time. If an aunt, for example, tests negative, then there is generally no need to perform cascade testing on that aunt&rsquo;s children. </p><p/><p>Genetic testing will identify a specific mutation in approximately 80 percent of patients with a high probability LQTS diagnosis (ie, Schwartz score &gt;3.5). It may establish the diagnosis when it is uncertain, allow for efficient identification of affected family members, and have prognostic and therapeutic utility by determining which gene is involved. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics of congenital and acquired long QT syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Genetic testing to identify specific mutations is now more readily available for clinical use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-diagnosis/abstract/4,7,44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7,44-46</a>].<strong> </strong>As a result, genotyping has become more frequently utilized as part of the evaluation of patients with congenital LQTS. However, congenital LQTS is a complex and genetically heterogeneous condition, so a negative test does not exclude disease. Nevertheless, when a negative genetic test is obtained (which by itself rules out approximately 80 percent of congenital LQTS), it is very reasonable to reassess the veracity of the clinical diagnosis of congenital LQTS. If the diagnosis is robust, then the patient belongs to the 20 percent subset of genotype negative congenital LQTS patients, and the patient and their family should be connected to research laboratories to search for their genetic cause of LQTS. On the other hand, if the strength of the evidence was <span class=\"nowrap\">weak/inconclusive</span> in the first place, then a negative genetic test can help begin the subsequent reevaluation efforts to move away from and rescind the previously rendered diagnosis of congenital LQTS, which can involve the removal of previously implanted defibrillators as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-diagnosis/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].<strong> </strong>This is yet another reason why consideration for referral to LQTS specialty centers should be given. In one dedicated LQTS clinic, 40 percent of the patients who came with the diagnosis of LQTS were dismissed without the diagnosis of LQTS, with the vast majority of those being reclassified as otherwise healthy without any evidence of important heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-diagnosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p>Genetic testing in LQTS is discussed in detail separately.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial diagnostic strategy includes evaluation of the presenting event (syncope, seizures, or sudden death), obtaining a careful family history, careful evaluation of the QTc, exclusion of secondary causes of QT prolongation, ambulatory ECG monitoring (with 12-lead ECG if available), exercise testing, and calculation of the LQTS score. (See <a href=\"#H2364630001\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obtaining a detailed personal medical history and multi-generation family history is crucial in determining the pretest likelihood of congenital LQTS. The personal clinical history should focus on signs and symptoms suggestive of tachyarrhythmia, particularly ventricular tachyarrhythmias, as many LQTS families have pre-sudden death warning signs including syncope suggestive of cardiac etiology, syncope with seizures, or resuscitated sudden cardiac arrest. (See <a href=\"#H4198861924\" class=\"local\">'Clinical and family history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients being evaluated for congenital LQTS should have a 12-lead ECG performed. The QT interval should be measured manually on serial ECGs using multiple leads (preferably leads II and V5), and then corrected for heart rate. The heart rate corrected QT interval (QTc) is the most useful diagnostic and prognostic parameter for LQTS. The computer-derived QTc should always be confirmed or corrected manually. Since the QTc varies in response to physiologic factors and drugs, the sensitivity of a QTc from a single ECG is less than 100 percent, and serial ECG testing is frequently required.
