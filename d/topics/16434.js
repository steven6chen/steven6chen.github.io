These disorders include focal cerebral injury due to arterial ischemic stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis, and primary intracerebral hemorrhage. Perinatal stroke is a common cause of acute neonatal encephalopathy, and may manifest as seizures, altered mental status, and sensorimotor deficits. It is an important cause of chronic neurologic disability.</p><p>The management and prognosis of perinatal stroke are reviewed here. Other clinical aspects are discussed separately.

It should be directed at treatment of underlying conditions and prevention of further injury. Thus, it is important to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation, to correct dehydration and anemia, and to monitor and correct metabolic disturbances, including acidosis, hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, and electrolyte disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-the-newborn-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. If infection is suspected, antibiotic treatment should be started until culture results are available.</p><p>Seizures should be treated with anticonvulsant medications. Because clinical identification of seizures is unreliable in neonates, prolonged video-electroencephalogram monitoring may be necessary to accurately characterize the extent, nature, and localization of clinical versus electrographic seizures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis of neonatal seizures&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Programs incorporating physical, occupational, and speech therapy may help to improve functional outcomes for children with perinatal stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-the-newborn-management-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Acute interventions for specific subtypes of perinatal stroke are discussed in the sections that follow.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1846289366\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of arterial ischemic stroke</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of perinatal ischemic stroke with antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants is controversial. Except for the supportive care and treatment of seizures noted above, management in most cases consists of observation and monitoring. Because most thromboembolic strokes in infants do not recur or progress, this approach avoids the complications associated with anticoagulation. However, selected infants may benefit from treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">aspirin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">unfractionated heparin</a>, or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). In accord with national guidelines and available data, we suggest treatment with antithrombotic therapy using either aspirin, unfractionated heparin, or LMWH for neonates who have or may be at risk for recurrent arterial ischemic stroke due to documented systemic or cardiac risk factors.</p><p>For neonates with a first arterial ischemic stroke, the 2012 American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines suggest supportive care rather than anticoagulation or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">aspirin</a> therapy in the absence of a documented ongoing cardioembolic source [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-the-newborn-management-and-prognosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. For neonates with a first arterial ischemic stroke and a documented cardioembolic source, the ACCP guidelines suggest anticoagulation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">unfractionated heparin</a> or LMWH. For neonates with recurrent arterial ischemic stroke, the ACCP suggests the use of anticoagulant or aspirin therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of thrombosis in the newborn&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Guidelines from the American Heart Association (AHA) Stroke Council published in 2008 state that anticoagulation with LMWH or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">unfractionated heparin</a> may be considered for neonates with severe thrombophilic disorders or multiple cerebral or systemic emboli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-the-newborn-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Thrombolytic therapy is rarely if ever used to treat stroke in newborns, in contrast to older children or adults. The AHA guidelines recommend <strong>not</strong> using thrombolytic agents in neonates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-the-newborn-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The AHA guidelines state that it is reasonable to give folate and B vitamins to patients with a methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) mutation in an effort to normalize homocysteine levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-the-newborn-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1806039149\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of CSVT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the available data, we suggest initial anticoagulation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">unfractionated heparin</a> or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for neonates with acute perinatal cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CSVT) with or without associated intracranial hemorrhagic infarction or parenchymal hemorrhage. Anticoagulation should be continued after the acute period for at least six weeks using LMWH. Repeat imaging with MRI and MRV at the targeted endpoint of therapy (six weeks) may be useful in guiding duration of therapy. For neonates who have not achieved clinically significant recanalization, we suggest extending the duration of anticoagulation therapy for up to six months with the aim of attaining partial or full recanalization of thrombosed sinuses.</p><p>Nevertheless, the role of systemic anticoagulation for the treatment of acute perinatal CSVT remains controversial. This issue is reflected by inconsistency in the use of anticoagulation for this disorder. As an example, in the International Pediatric Stroke Study, approximately one-half of neonates with CSVT were treated with anticoagulation using heparin or LMWH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-the-newborn-management-and-prognosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Nevertheless, accumulating observational evidence supports the safety of anticoagulation for perinatal CSVT:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A single-center prospective observational study found that clot propagation, often with new or progressive infarction, occurred in newborns with CSVT significantly more often in those who did not receive anticoagulation compared with those who did (10 of 35 [28 percent] versus 1 of 22 [5 percent]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-the-newborn-management-and-prognosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Moreover, the use of anticoagulation was not associated with life-threatening hemorrhage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a single-center cohort study in the Netherlands, 7 of 10 infants with thalamic hemorrhage due to CSVT received anticoagulation, and none had new hemorrhage referable to this therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-the-newborn-management-and-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p>A randomized clinical trial of anticoagulation for neonatal CSVT is urgently needed.</p><p>For neonates with CSVT without significant intracerebral hemorrhage, the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines suggest initial anticoagulation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">unfractionated heparin</a> or LMWH and subsequent anticoagulation with LMWH for a minimum of six weeks but no longer than three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-the-newborn-management-and-prognosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. One approach discussed by the ACCP is to assess for recanalization at six weeks and to stop anticoagulants if recanalization is complete or, if incomplete, to continue anticoagulation for an additional six weeks (total three months) and then stop. For neonates with CSVT who have significant hemorrhage, the ACCP suggests either anticoagulation or supportive care with radiologic monitoring of the thrombosis at five to seven days and anticoagulation if thrombus propagation is noted at that time.</p><p>The American Heart Association guidelines state that anticoagulation with LMWH or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">unfractionated heparin</a> may be considered for neonates with clinical or radiologic evidence of propagating CSVT despite supportive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-the-newborn-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1481507687\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of intracerebral hemorrhage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We agree with guidelines from the AHA, which recommend the following measures for neonates with intracerebral hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-the-newborn-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Correction of markedly low platelet counts</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Replacement of deficient coagulation factors for neonates who have coagulation factor deficiency</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vitamin K administration for neonates who have vitamin K-dependent coagulation disorders</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ventricular drainage for those who develop hydrocephalus, followed by shunting if hydrocephalus persists</p><p/><p>The AHA guidelines note that it is reasonable to evacuate an intraparenchymal brain hemorrhage to reduce elevated intracranial pressure, but it is not clear whether this intervention always improves outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-the-newborn-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1599751842\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perinatal stroke may cause long-term impairments in motor function (including cerebral palsy), cognition, language, behavior, mood, and vision, as well as epilepsy. However, there is a wide variation in morbidity and mortality that depends in part upon the location and extent of brain injury, and the presence of comorbid medical problems. The evidence for prognosis of specific subtypes of perinatal stroke is reviewed in the sections that follow. The bulk of the data pertain to arterial ischemic stroke, which is the most common subtype of perinatal stroke.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2690017444\"><span class=\"h2\">Prognosis of arterial ischemic stroke</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Long-term development is normal in approximately 19 to 41 percent of infants with perinatal ischemic infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-the-newborn-management-and-prognosis/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>]. As an example, a study involving 46 children with perinatal cerebral infarction who were followed for 18 to 164 months (mean 42 months) found that neurodevelopmental outcome was normal in 33 percent and abnormal in 67 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-the-newborn-management-and-prognosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Among the 31 children with abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome, multiple disabilities were present in nearly 75 percent; cerebral palsy and cognitive impairment occurred in 71 and 61 percent, respectively.</p><p>A mechanism for recovery in some cases may be growth of undamaged brain at the margins of the infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-the-newborn-management-and-prognosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3984246688\"><span class=\"h3\">Motor disability and cerebral palsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Motor disability is common after perinatal ischemic stroke, with frank hemiparesis in approximately 25 to 30 percent and milder neuromotor dysfunction in another 30 percent of infants with unilateral infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-the-newborn-management-and-prognosis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. It develops in nearly all cases in which infarction involves the entire vascular territory of the middle cerebral artery.

The development of cerebral palsy after perinatal stroke appears to be associated with stroke size, stroke location, and with a delayed clinical presentation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-etiology-and-prevention-of-cerebral-palsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, etiology, and prevention of cerebral palsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>These observations are supported by a retrospective population-based study that identified 36 infants with perinatal stroke who were observed for at least 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-the-newborn-management-and-prognosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Abnormal outcomes occurred in 29 patients (81 percent), and included cerebral palsy in 21 (58 percent), epilepsy in 14 (39 percent), language delay in 9 (25 percent), and behavioral abnormalities in 8 (22 percent). Cerebral palsy was associated with a delayed presentation (ie, the infant was considered neurologically normal before one month of age, but was later diagnosed with an old arterial stroke). In addition, the risk for cerebral palsy was associated with large stroke size and neuroimaging localization to Broca's area, Wernicke's area, internal capsule, or basal ganglia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-classification-of-cerebral-palsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and classification of cerebral palsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Diffusion-weighted MRI obtained between 3 and 10 days of age, and diffusion tensor imaging tractography at three months of age, can identify signal abnormalities representing probable Wallerian degeneration in the descending motor pathways (eg, corticospinal tract) projecting from the primary infarct (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55919\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef55919 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-the-newborn-management-and-prognosis/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>].

Bilateral involvement or a large lesion increased the risk of poor outcome. A later study found that school-aged survivors of perinatal arterial ischemic stroke had below-average full-scale IQ scores (mean 87, 95% CI 80-94) compared with the normative sample (mean 100) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-the-newborn-management-and-prognosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Lower cognitive performance was associated with basal ganglia and thalamic involvement and the development of postnatal epilepsy.</p><p>Cognitive deficits may emerge with time, as suggested by findings from a longitudinal study of 26 children who presented with neonatal seizures and were diagnosed with unilateral perinatal infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-the-newborn-management-and-prognosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The children showed no differences from published norms on measures of intellectual ability when tested as preschoolers (mean age 4.8 years). However, mild but statistically significant declines in full scale IQ scores were present when they were retested at school age (mean age 8.9 years). The declines reflected impairment in nonverbal reasoning, working memory, and processing speed. In another report of 40 children with perinatal arterial ischemic stroke who were assessed at age 3 to 16 years, factors associated with poor performance on attention and executive functioning measures were larger infarct volume, comorbid epilepsy, and presumed perinatal arterial ischemic stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-in-the-newborn-management-and-prognosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Unilateral perinatal stroke does not appear to impair social behavior in childhood.
