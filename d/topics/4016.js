All three pathogenic species, <em>B. burgdorferi</em>, <em>Borrelia afzelii</em>, and <em>Borrelia garinii</em>, occur in Europe, and the latter two species have been identified in Asia. Lyme disease has a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, and it also varies in severity due, in part, to differences in the infecting species.</p><p>Lyme disease was first described in 1977 as &quot;Lyme arthritis&quot; in studies of a cluster in Connecticut of children who were thought to have juvenile rheumatoid arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-lyme-disease-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

However, the clinical features of each stage can overlap and some patients present in a later stage of Lyme disease without a history of prior signs or symptoms suggestive of earlier Lyme disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-lyme-disease-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early localized disease is characterized by the appearance of the characteristic skin lesion, erythema migrans (EM), with or without constitutional symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F81270\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81270 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57414\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57414 \">picture 2</a>). EM usually occurs within one month following the tick bite.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early disseminated disease is characterized by multiple EM lesions (that typically occur days to weeks after infection) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neurologic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cardiac findings (that typically occur weeks to months after infection). Some of these patients have no history of antecedent early localized Lyme disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Late Lyme disease is typically associated with intermittent or persistent arthritis involving one or a few large joints, especially the knee (sometimes preceded by migratory arthralgias), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> certain rare neurologic problems, primarily a subtle encephalopathy or polyneuropathy. Late Lyme disease may develop months to a few years after the initial infection. Arthritis may be the presenting manifestation of the disease.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">UNITED STATES VERSUS EUROPE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The basic features of Lyme disease are similar worldwide, but there are regional variations, primarily between the illness found in the United States and that found in Europe and Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-lyme-disease-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The following observations illustrate the range of findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective cohort study evaluated 204 patients with erythema migrans (EM), 119 due to <em>B. burgdorferi</em> sensu stricto in the United States and 85 due to <em>B. afzelii</em> in Slovenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-lyme-disease-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. American patients had higher rates of systemic symptoms (69 versus 51 percent), multiple EM lesions (13 versus 7 percent), and seropositivity (89 versus 31 percent), and a briefer duration of EM prior to presentation (4 versus 14 days).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another report, EM lesions in American patients who had <em>B. burgdorferi</em> infection expanded faster than lesions in Austrian patients who had <em>B. afzelii</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-lyme-disease-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The more rapidly growing EM lesions in American patients was associated with higher mRNA levels of chemokines and cytokines associated with macrophage activation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some of the skin manifestations of Lyme disease such as borrelial lymphocytoma, acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, and morphea-like lesions, seem to occur exclusively in Europe. In addition, <em>B. garinii</em> infection in Europe rarely causes the following late neurologic features: chronic encephalomyelitis, characterized by spastic paraparesis, cranial neuropathy, or cognitive impairment with marked intrathecal antibody production to the spirochete. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Borrelial lymphocytoma'</a> below and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Cutaneous manifestations'</a> below and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Neurologic features'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EARLY LOCALIZED DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early localized disease includes erythema migrans (EM) and nonspecific findings that resemble a viral syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Erythema migrans</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EM is a rash that appears at the site of the tick bite, usually within 7 to 14 days after the bite (range 3 to 30 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-lyme-disease-in-adults/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. While early erythema at the tick bite site is common due to a reaction to antigens in the tick saliva, this early allergic reaction must be differentiated from EM, which requires at least several days before slow expansion of the lesion begins. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insect-bites#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Insect bites&quot;, section on 'Ticks'</a>.)</p><p>EM occurs in approximately 80 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-lyme-disease-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

As they expand, some central clearing often develops, and they may have a more complex target or bull's eye appearance.<br/><br/>Although central clearing is considered classic for EM, it often requires considerable expansion of the lesion and is usually not yet present in the first days of illness. In an observational cohort study of 118 cases of EM in which <em>B. burgdorferi</em> infection was confirmed by culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the EM lesion was homogeneous in 59 percent, had central erythema in 32 percent, and central clearing in 9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-lyme-disease-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Forty-two of 269 (16 percent) patients with definite or possible Lyme disease had systemic symptoms without EM; 18 of these had laboratory evidence of accompanying anaplasmosis, or babesiosis and possible Lyme disease, leaving 24 patients (9 percent) with laboratory-defined Lyme disease alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-lyme-disease-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Symptoms in these 24 patients included arthralgias in 17, headache in 13, and neck stiffness in 10.

Although standard serologic tests for Lyme disease may be negative during the first several weeks of infection, one would expect to see seroconversion after that time if the patient has persistent infection. Moreover, a clinical picture of persistent or recurrent flu-like symptoms after antibiotic treatment in a seronegative patient is unlikely to be due to <em>B. burgdorferi</em> infection.

Although spirochetemic patients were significantly more likely to be symptomatic (89 versus 74 percent) and have multiple lesions (42 versus 15 percent) than those without spirochetemia, 8 of 35 asymptomatic patients (23 percent) with a single skin lesion had a positive blood culture. The risk for spirochetemia was present the day the patient noticed the lesion and continued for more than two weeks.</p><p>In another study, blood cultures were positive in 5 of 26 untreated patients (19 percent) with early disseminated Lyme disease, with neurologic, cardiac, or musculoskeletal involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-lyme-disease-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Patients with a positive blood culture had a shorter duration of symptoms compared with those with a negative blood culture (mean 14 days versus 125 days, respectively).

The term &quot;post-Lyme disease syndrome&quot; is often used to describe the nonspecific symptoms (such as headache, fatigue, and arthralgias) that may persist for months after treatment of Lyme disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-lyme-disease-in-adults/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>]. For the majority of patients, these symptoms improve gradually over six months to one year.

Criteria for this syndrome include a prior history of Lyme disease treated with an accepted regimen and resolution or stabilization of the objective manifestations of Lyme disease. In addition, the onset of subjective symptoms (eg, fatigue, widespread musculoskeletal pain, complaints of cognitive difficulties) must have occurred within six months of the diagnosis of Lyme disease and persist (continuously or relapsing) for at least six months after completion of antimicrobial therapy. There are also several exclusion criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F74043\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74043 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>The cause of persistent nonspecific symptoms after treatment for Lyme disease remains an area of uncertainty. Although there is evidence in animal models that <em>B. burgdorferi</em> can persist after antibiotic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-lyme-disease-in-adults/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>], a link to persistent symptoms in humans has not been established. The IDSA guidelines in 2006, the American Academy of Neurology practice parameter in 2007, and the Ad Hoc International Lyme Disease Group in 2007 concluded that currently available evidence does not support the hypothesis that persistent infection with <em>B. burgdorferi</em> is the cause of chronic subjective symptoms that may occur after recommended courses of antibiotic therapy for Lyme disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-lyme-disease-in-adults/abstract/8,47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,47,48</a>]. The data supporting this conclusion are discussed separately.

Of the three major randomized trials of patients with post-Lyme disease syndrome, all had substantial difficulty in identifying subjects who met the entry criteria and therefore enrolled only a minority of those who were screened [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-lyme-disease-in-adults/abstract/42,44,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,44,49</a>]. The majority of the other patients typically have no evidence of having had Lyme disease, although many have been given a diagnosis of &quot;chronic Lyme disease.&quot;</p><p>Chronic Lyme disease is a term that is used by some practitioners and patient advocacy groups. In its typical usage, it includes the post-Lyme disease syndrome described above, as well as illnesses and symptom complexes for which there is no convincing scientific evidence of any relationship to <em>B. burgdorferi</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-lyme-disease-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Many of these patients have other recognizable syndromes or diagnoses.

Among patients with nonspecific symptoms of fatigue and myalgias, these subjective symptoms are sometimes accompanied by tender points of fibromyalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-lyme-disease-in-adults/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Since fibromyalgia is common in the general population, the association of Lyme disease and fibromyalgia may sometimes be by chance alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-lyme-disease-in-adults/abstract/8,52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,52,53</a>].

Antibiotic-treated patients with persistence of arthritis after clearance of <em>B. burgdorferi</em> DNA from the synovial fluid (as determined by polymerase chain reaction) do not respond to additional courses of antibiotics. The mechanism for persistence of arthritis is unclear; however, these patients may respond to antiinflammatory therapy. It has been hypothesized that infection of the joint may have triggered autoimmunity in the joints of these patients. In the absence of antiinflammatory therapy, &quot;antibiotic-refractory arthritis&quot; may persist for months to several years, but will eventually resolve spontaneously. Almost no patients have persistent symptoms extending past five years.

The ospC genotype was found to be different at each initial and second episode of erythema migrans, demonstrating that repeat episodes of erythema migrans in appropriately treated patients were due to reinfection rather than relapse.<br/></p><p>Reinfected patients may have a marked anamnestic immune response with rapid IgG isotype switching [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-lyme-disease-in-adults/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. However, in patients who are treated during the early stages of disease, this immune response is typically directed against antigens for which antibodies do not protect against reinfection or in which variations in proteins expressed by different strains of <em>B. burgdorferi</em> can thwart protection from these previously developed immune responses. In contrast, patients who have had late stage manifestations of Lyme disease often have an expanded antibody response to many additional antigens that protects against reinfection. Reinfection has not been reported in patients who previously had Lyme arthritis, a late disease manifestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-lyme-disease-in-adults/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because <em>Borrelia</em> species are spirochetes, there has been concern about the possibility of congenital Lyme disease given the serious congenital disease that can result from maternal syphilis, another spirochetal disease.

(See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Late disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonspecific symptoms (such as headache, fatigue, and arthralgias) may persist for months after treatment of Lyme disease. There is no evidence that these persistent subjective complaints represent ongoing active infection or that repeated or prolonged courses of antibiotics beyond what is recommended in the Infectious Diseases Society of America and American Academy of Neurology guidelines provide any benefit. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Post-Lyme disease syndrome and chronic Lyme disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Current evidence suggests that there is no definable congenital Lyme disease syndrome. Diagnosis and treatment for Lyme disease during pregnancy is the same as in the nongravid patient, except that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a> are not used.
