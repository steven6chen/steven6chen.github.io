Many of these diseases present with recurrent fevers and are termed the periodic fever syndromes, although other features may sometimes dominate the clinical picture. The best characterized autoinflammatory diseases arise from mutations in single genes, but related mechanisms participate in many diseases in which inflammation contributes to tissue injury.</p><p>An overview of autoinflammatory diseases is presented here, with a focus on shared pathogenic and pathophysiologic mechanisms. While the most salient features of the individual disorders are discussed in this topic review, more detailed descriptions of the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of the major autoinflammatory diseases are presented elsewhere. (See appropriate topic reviews.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1108450935\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immune defense requires both antigen-specific and antigen-independent mechanisms. The antigen-specific arm of the immune response, referred to as adaptive immunity, is based upon learned <span class=\"nowrap\">self/nonself</span> discrimination mediated by selective expansion of T and B cell clones in which genetic recombination has generated antigen-specific receptors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The adaptive cellular immune response&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, these &quot;learned&quot; responses are not the only mechanism of immune defense. Innate immunity refers to a network of cells and proteins that respond to infection or tissue injury through genetically &quot;hard-wired&quot; recognition of foreign molecules (eg, bacterial cell wall components) or host molecules produced or released by damaged cells (eg, interleukin-1 [IL-1] and uric acid crystals). Neutrophils, macrophages, mast cells, and natural killer cells are among the principal cellular effectors of innate immunity. Complement, a set of proteins that recognize and bind nonself targets, exemplifies noncellular innate immunity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of the innate immune system&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complement-pathways\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complement pathways&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toll-like-receptors-roles-in-disease-and-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toll-like receptors: Roles in disease and therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Innate and adaptive immune mechanisms work closely together. Recognition of danger signals by innate immune mechanisms directs the development of adaptive immune responses, while lack of such recognition favors tolerance. Established adaptive immune responses recruit innate immunity to assist with the effector response. As examples, T cells can recruit neutrophils, and B cell-derived antibodies can target bacteria for lysis by complement.</p><p>Autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, myasthenia gravis, and type 1 diabetes, represent mistakes in <span class=\"nowrap\">self/nonself</span> discrimination by adaptive immune mechanisms. Hallmarks include the presence of autoantibodies, a female predominance (usually), and association with specific alleles in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), whose proteins are responsible for presenting peptides to T cells.</p><p>By contrast, autoinflammatory diseases arise through inappropriate activation of antigen-independent inflammatory mechanisms. Thus, they may broadly be considered to represent primary diseases of innate immunity, although cells more typically associated with adaptive immunity (eg, lymphocytes) may also contribute to autoinflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-syndromes-and-other-autoinflammatory-diseases-an-overview/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Accordingly, these diseases typically lack autoantibodies or MHC associations and occur as commonly in males as in females. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-autoimmunity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of autoimmunity&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Many autoinflammatory diseases are rare and therefore (with the exception of familial Mediterranean fever [FMF] and periodic fever with aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis [PFAPA] syndrome) are unlikely to be encountered in routine clinical practice. However, they illustrate the important principle that the mechanisms controlling innate immunity are critical to regulation of inflammation. More subtle variants in these mechanisms probably contribute to the presentation of other much more common diseases.</p><p>As an example, most heterozygous carriers for mutations in the FMF gene (<em>MEFV</em>) do not manifest frank FMF, but they may demonstrate more frequent fevers; more dramatic sepsis physiology; a higher incidence of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and certain vasculitides; and more severe rheumatoid arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-syndromes-and-other-autoinflammatory-diseases-an-overview/abstract/3-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-8</a>]. The emerging picture is that many disorders generally regarded as autoimmune probably also include aspects that might be considered autoinflammatory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-syndromes-and-other-autoinflammatory-diseases-an-overview/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In addition, common diseases such as gout, pseudogout, and even atherosclerotic coronary artery disease engage autoinflammatory mechanisms including the inflammasome, a complex of proteins responsible for generating the potent proinflammatory cytokine IL-1-beta and that is dysregulated in many autoinflammatory diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-syndromes-and-other-autoinflammatory-diseases-an-overview/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HALLMARKS OF THE AUTOINFLAMMATORY DISEASES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Autoinflammatory diseases should be suspected when a patient presents with recurrent episodes of inflammation unexplained by another cause, such as infection or malignancy. Manifestations may include fever, rash, serositis (pleuritis or peritonitis), arthritis, meningitis, and uveitis. Lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly may also occur, and secondary (amyloid A) amyloidosis can complicate longstanding disease. Most patients develop their first disease manifestations in childhood, although milder or atypical forms can present de novo in adults.</p><p>Inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), are elevated during disease flares and may sometimes be abnormal between episodes. In contrast to autoimmune diseases, high-titer autoantibodies are usually absent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H549352622\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis is considered in patients who present with a history of fevers that recur over months or years in the absence of associated viral or bacterial infection. Unusual infections and malignancy are first excluded. The evaluation then proceeds with an attempt to identify a clinical pattern consistent with one of the major autoinflammatory disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67805\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67805 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-syndromes-and-other-autoinflammatory-diseases-an-overview/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Validated clinical criteria have been developed for the diagnosis and classification of the major periodic fever syndromes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F101819\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101819 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-syndromes-and-other-autoinflammatory-diseases-an-overview/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Empiric therapeutic trials using glucocorticoids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a>, or interleukin-1 (IL-1) blockade (typically with anakinra) can be informative. Genetic testing is employed for confirmation of a clinically suspected entity, but genetic panels testing multiple disorders can be helpful where uncertainty remains. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-of-unknown-origin-in-children-etiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fever of unknown origin in children: Etiology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-of-unknown-origin-in-children-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fever of unknown origin in children: Evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiologies-of-fever-of-unknown-origin-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiologies of fever of unknown origin in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-fever-of-unknown-origin\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with fever of unknown origin&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H863905394\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The most useful discriminators are the duration and periodicity of fevers; ethnicity (eg, Mediterranean descent in familial Mediterranean fever [FMF]); family history of a similar syndrome, which suggests a heritable disorder (although recessive or de novo mutations will often lack such a history); and presence of associated clinical features. As an example, the following findings were noted in a study of 228 Italian patients with periodic fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-syndromes-and-other-autoinflammatory-diseases-an-overview/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Detection of a relevant mutation was more likely in patients with a family history of periodic fever, early age at disease onset, and clinical manifestations of abdominal pain (which was the strongest positive predictor), chest pain, or diarrhea. In contrast, the presence of aphthous ulcers (also known as canker sores) was a negative predictor (odds ratio 0.2).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two features were helpful in distinguishing among the disorders: the duration of fever, which is shortest in FMF (mean two to three days) and longest in tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha receptor-1 associated syndrome (TRAPS, mean 15 days in severe disease and five to nine days in mild disease), and the presence of vomiting or splenomegaly, which may be seen in hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome (HIDS).</p><p/><p>The diagnostic evaluation should be informed by the epidemiology of each condition. FMF and periodic fever with aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis (PFAPA) are common, but the other periodic fever syndromes are rare. As an example, the prevalence of cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) in France was calculated at 1:360,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-syndromes-and-other-autoinflammatory-diseases-an-overview/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In addition, certain syndromes are more common in specific populations. Gene carriage of FMF-related mutations, for example, exceeds 10 percent in specific populations of Armenians, Turks, and Ashkenazi Jews. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=periodic-fever-with-aphthous-stomatitis-pharyngitis-and-adenitis-pfapa-syndrome#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Periodic fever with aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis (PFAPA syndrome)&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=familial-mediterranean-fever-epidemiology-genetics-and-pathogenesis#H2174216678\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Familial Mediterranean fever: Epidemiology, genetics, and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>Diagnosis is important because of potential implications for therapy, monitoring for the development of secondary (amyloid A, AA) amyloidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-syndromes-and-other-autoinflammatory-diseases-an-overview/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], and the need for genetic counseling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-syndromes-and-other-autoinflammatory-diseases-an-overview/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, many patients still defy diagnostic classification despite advances in diagnostic testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-syndromes-and-other-autoinflammatory-diseases-an-overview/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In such patients, reconsideration of the full differential diagnosis is essential. If an autoinflammatory disease appears likely, empiric therapy patterned on that employed in other autoinflammatory diseases is often warranted. Referral to a center with appropriate expertise to perform <span class=\"nowrap\">exome/genome</span> sequencing, including evaluation for mosaicism (presence of a mutant gene in some cells but not others) (see <a href=\"#H2633435887\" class=\"local\">'Mosaicism'</a> below), or other targeted investigation should be considered and may lead to a definitive diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=next-generation-dna-sequencing-ngs-principles-and-clinical-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS): Principles and clinical applications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H863905394\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis includes unusual infections such as relapsing fever, malignancy and premalignant states (Schnitzler syndrome), cyclic neutropenia, and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis <span class=\"nowrap\">(sJIA)/adult-onset</span> Still's disease (AOSD). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-of-unknown-origin-in-children-etiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fever of unknown origin in children: Etiology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-of-unknown-origin-in-children-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fever of unknown origin in children: Evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiologies-of-fever-of-unknown-origin-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiologies of fever of unknown origin in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-fever-of-unknown-origin\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with fever of unknown origin&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Relapsing fever</strong> &ndash; Relapsing fever is similar in name to periodic fever syndromes. However, relapsing fever is an arthropod-borne infectious disease, caused by spirochetes of the <em>Borrelia</em> genus, not an autoinflammatory disease. It is also characterized by recurrent episodes of fever. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-relapsing-fever\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and management of relapsing fever&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cyclic neutropenia</strong> &ndash; Other than periodic fever with aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis (PFAPA), fever in these disorders is episodic and recurrent rather than truly periodic. Thus, the presence of a predictable recurrent fever pattern should trigger consideration of cyclic neutropenia, which may be of childhood or adult onset. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclic-neutropenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cyclic neutropenia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Schnitzler syndrome</strong> &ndash; Schnitzler syndrome is an acquired autoinflammatory syndrome that presents with chronic urticaria associated with monoclonal immunoglobulin M (IgM) gammopathy (most often IgM kappa). Additional features may include bone pain, skeletal hyperostosis, arthralgias, lymphadenopathy, and intermittent fevers. Patients are at increased risk of hematologic malignancies. There is no specific test for Schnitzler syndrome, and clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion in patients with chronic urticaria and a monoclonal IgM gammopathy. Most patients respond well to inhibition of the interleukin (IL)-1 pathway. Schnitzler syndrome is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urticarial-vasculitis#H42\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urticarial vasculitis&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Systemic juvenile idiopathic <span class=\"nowrap\">arthritis/adult-onset</span> Still's disease</strong> &ndash; A further diagnostic consideration is the febrile-onset arthritis known in childhood as systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) and in adults as adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD). Patients with these conditions present with features including high-spiking fevers, rash, serositis, and lymphadenopathy. Arthritis is often evident at onset but may sometimes lag for weeks or months. These clinical features, as well as brisk response to interleukin-1 (IL-1) antagonism in many patients, has led many to conclude that <span class=\"nowrap\">sJIA/AOSD</span> also belong to the family of autoinflammatory diseases, although important differences remain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-syndromes-and-other-autoinflammatory-diseases-an-overview/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. These diseases are discussed in detail separately.

Interleukin-1 (IL-1) blockade is effective in many of these disorders. However, blocking tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha may ameliorate certain autoinflammatory syndromes, such as TNF receptor-1 associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) or possibly chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO). Diseases mediated by interferon may respond to blockade of the intracellular Janus kinase (JAK) proteins that mediate interferon signaling. Treatment of these syndromes is discussed in greater detail in the individual disease-specific topics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H549352666\"><span class=\"h1\">MAJOR PERIODIC FEVER SYNDROMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The periodic fever syndromes include familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-1 associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome (HIDS), cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), and periodic fevers with aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis (PFAPA). While these disorders are commonly termed periodic fever syndromes, in most cases, fever is episodic and recurrent rather than truly periodic, with the exception of PFAPA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Familial Mediterranean fever</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FMF (MIM #249100) is the most common of the monogenic periodic fever syndromes. FMF is an autosomal recessive disorder in which there is a mutation in the FMF gene (<em>MEFV</em>) encoding the protein pyrin, one function of which is regulation of the production of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), a mediator also implicated in several other autoinflammatory disorders.</p><p>FMF is characterized by episodic attacks of fever lasting one to three days. Most patients also experience abdominal pain, pleurisy, and arthralgias or arthritis, the result of accompanying serositis and synovitis. Attacks are accompanied by an elevation in peripheral white blood cell count and acute phase markers, while fluid from inflamed joints exhibits a neutrophil-predominant leukocytosis. Persistent inflammation can lead to secondary (amyloid A, AA) amyloidosis.</p><p>The diagnosis may be strongly suggested by patient ethnicity. Sephardic Jews, Armenians, North Africans, Turks, and, to a lesser extent, Ashkenazi Jews, Greeks, and Italians are potential carriers. However, individuals outside these groups have also been affected.</p><p>The pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of FMF are discussed separately.

TRAPS is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion with incomplete penetrance. The genetic defect in TRAPS resides in the gene that encodes the 55 kDa receptor for tumor necrosis factor (the <em>TNFR1</em> gene).</p><p>Patients may present from infancy to the 40s and even beyond, though more than half develop symptoms in the first decade of life. Though the first patients identified were of Irish (Hibernian) descent, other ethnicities are also represented. Flares commonly last for at least five days and often continue for more than two weeks. They are typically accompanied by conjunctivitis and periorbital edema in addition to focal migratory myalgias, rash, abdominal pain, and, occasionally, monoarthritis. The rash may take a relatively characteristic form, with single or multiple erythematous patches that spread distally down an extremity.</p><p>The genetics, clinical manifestations, pathogenesis, prognosis, and treatment of TRAPS are discussed in detail elsewhere.

These mutations reduce, but do not abolish, mevalonate kinase activity. Mutations in <em>MVK</em> that abolish enzyme activity result in mevalonic aciduria (MIM #610377), an autosomal recessive disease characterized by developmental delay, hepatosplenomegaly, dysmorphology, and failure to thrive in addition to episodic fevers.</p><p>More than two-thirds of patients with HIDS present within the first year of life with episodic attacks of fever lasting three to seven days, accompanied, in most cases, by chills, cervical lymphadenopathy, abdominal pain, and vomiting or diarrhea. Some patients experience headache, arthralgias or arthritis, aphthous ulceration, a pleomorphic rash, and, occasionally, splenomegaly. Attacks may be precipitated by vaccination, viral infection, trauma, and stress.</p><p>Most patients have characteristic abnormalities in immunoglobulins, including elevated levels of immunoglobulin D (IgD) (&gt;100 int. <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL),</span> and 80 percent also have elevated immunoglobulin A (IgA).

NLRP3 is a scaffold protein that permits an assembly of the inflammasome, a protein complex that cleaves inactive prointerleukin-1 beta (pro-IL-1beta) into its highly inflammatory, mature form. Mutations in NLRP3 impair control of inflammasome assembly and therefore lead to aberrant production of IL-1beta. Accordingly, these &quot;gain-of-function&quot; mutations are typically autosomal dominant. The inflammasome also acts upon other proteins such as IL-18 and IL-33, and can trigger inflammatory cell death via a process termed pyroptosis, such that the mechanisms leading from NLRP3 mutation to disease are probably complex.</p><p>Patients with CAPS typically fall into one of three clinical syndromes with overlapping clinical features:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mildest, familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS1, MIM #120100), is manifested by brief (usually &lt;24 hours) episodes of fever and maculopapular or urticarial rashes triggered by exposure to cold, such as entering an air-conditioned building. Other cold-induced inflammatory syndromes include FCAS2 (mutation in <em>NLRP12</em> [NATCH domain, leucine-rich repeat, and pyrin domain-containing 12]) and FCAS3 (mutation in <em>PLCG2</em> [phospholipase C, gamma-2], also called PLCG2-associated antibody deficiency and immune dysregulation [PLAID]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-syndromes-and-other-autoinflammatory-diseases-an-overview/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].

Episodes in the father were triggered by physical and emotional stressors and also included erythematous plaques and joint pains. The NLRC4 mutation in this family caused an amino acid substitution affecting helical domain 1 (HD1) that serves as the &quot;lid&quot; for the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) for adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Mutations in the NBD of a related molecule, NLRP3 (cryopyrin), cause the cyropyrin-associated periodic syndromes. The NLRC4 mutation leads to constitutive activation of caspase 1 and production of interleukin-1 family cytokines (IL1FCs) that results in fever and macrophage pyroptosis (inflammatory cell death).
