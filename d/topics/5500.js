Notably, this has led to the development of multiple direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), which are medications targeted at specific steps within the HCV life cycle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F94365\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef94365 \">figure 1</a>). DAAs are molecules that target specific nonstructural proteins of the virus and results in disruption of viral replication and infection. There are four classes of DAAs, which are defined by their mechanism of action and therapeutic target. The four classes are nonstructural proteins <span class=\"nowrap\">3/4A</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(NS3/4A)</span> protease inhibitors (PIs), NS5B nucleoside polymerase inhibitors (NPIs), NS5B non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitors (NNPIs), and NS5A inhibitors<sup> </sup>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-acting-antivirals-for-the-treatment-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic reviews the mechanism of action, pharmacology, and spectrum of use of these various agents. Other important issues related to the treatment of chronic HCV infection, including patient evaluation, selection of treatment regimen, and other management issues are discussed in detail elsewhere.

The infectious viral structure is comprised of envelope glycoproteins in a lipid bilayer that contain the viral core protein and RNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-acting-antivirals-for-the-treatment-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. After cell entry, the viral RNA is translated through host machinery into a polyprotein, which is cleaved during and after translation by both host and viral-encoded proteases into 10 mature viral proteins, including a number of nonstructural (NS) proteins. One of the viral proteases involved in this post-translational processing is a heterodimeric complex of the NS3 and NS4A proteins <span class=\"nowrap\">(NS3/NS4A)</span>. NS3 possesses the proteolytic activity and NS4 is a membrane protein that acts as a cofactor. Synthesis of new viral RNA occurs in a highly structured replication complex that consists of NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B. NS5B is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is essential for viral replication. NS5A has a presumptive role in the organization of the replication complex and in regulating replication. It is also involved in assembly of the viral particle that is released from the host cell.</p><p>Direct-acting antivirals are inhibitors of the <span class=\"nowrap\">NS3/4A</span> protease, the NS5A protein, and the NS5B polymerase.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1225365824\"><span class=\"h1\">NS3/4A PROTEASE INHIBITORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">NS3/4A</span> protease inhibitors are inhibitors of the <span class=\"nowrap\">NS3/4A</span> serine protease, an enzyme involved in post-translational processing and replication of HCV. Protease inhibitors disrupt HCV by blocking the NS3 catalytic site or the <span class=\"nowrap\">NS3/NS4A</span> interaction<sup> </sup>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-acting-antivirals-for-the-treatment-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In addition to its role in viral processing, the <span class=\"nowrap\">NS3/NS4A</span> protease blocks TRIF-mediated Toll-like receptor signaling and Cardif-mediated retinoic acid&ndash;inducible gene 1 (RIG-1) signaling, which result in impaired induction of interferons and blocking viral elimination. Thus, inhibition of the <span class=\"nowrap\">NS3/4A</span> protease could contribute to antiviral activity through two mechanisms.</p><p>The first generation protease inhibitors <a href=\"topic.htm?path=telaprevir-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">telaprevir</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=boceprevir-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">boceprevir</a> were the first direct-acting antivirals available for the treatment of HCV, and were used in conjunction with peginterferon and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a> for the treatment of genotype 1 infection<sup> </sup>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-acting-antivirals-for-the-treatment-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].<sup> </sup>Following the introduction of other potent and better tolerated DAAs, the clinical importance of these agents diminished substantially because of their cumbersome administration, substantial adverse effects, drug-drug interactions, and low barrier to resistance. Subsequent-generation protease inhibitors offer several benefits over earlier protease inhibitors, including fewer drug-drug interactions, improved dosing schedules, and less frequent and less severe side effects. In addition, the newer protease inhibitors also appear to have increased efficacy against genotype 1 HCV; however, most still have limited efficacy against other genotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-acting-antivirals-for-the-treatment-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

As more individuals are treated, rare adverse effects may be identified. As an example, reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, in some cases with fulminant liver failure, has been described during DAA treatment of (HCV) infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-acting-antivirals-for-the-treatment-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. A subsequent review identified 524 cases of liver failure reported to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) over the course of one year, with an estimated 250,000 individuals treated over a similar time frame [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-acting-antivirals-for-the-treatment-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. It is unclear what proportion of these represent cases of HBV reactivation or complications in patients with existing advanced liver disease (including inappropriate use of protease inhibitors in patients with decompensated disease), situations in which the risk of liver failure is higher than the general population. Patients should understand that this risk is overall very low and that further data are needed to more clearly define it.</p><p>Monitoring for and managing HBV reactivation in the setting of HCV treatment is discussed elsewhere.

Most of the direct-acting antivirals available or in late stages of development are inhibitors of the <span class=\"nowrap\">NS3/4A</span> protease, the NS5A protein, and the NS5B polymerase (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F93884\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93884 \">table 1</a>).

Nevertheless, few significant drug-drug interactions may limit their use, and simeprevir and paritaprevir are only effective for genotype 1 infection. For simeprevir, certain viral polymorphisms are associated with resistance and decreased clinical efficacy.
