Other causes of infection-related glomerulonephritis, including poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis and glomerulonephritis associated with endocarditis or with viral, fungal, protozoal, or parasitic infections, are discussed elsewhere.

The most commonly used term for Streptococcus-related disease is poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis because the renal disease typically begins <strong>after</strong> the usually pharyngeal or skin infection has either resolved spontaneously or has been effectively treated.</p><p>By contrast, most of the other causes of bacterial infection-associated glomerulonephritis, including that due to <em>Staphylococcus </em>infection, occur when the patient is still infected. Thus, we prefer the term Staphylococcus-associated glomerulonephritis to distinguish it from glomerulonephritis that can develop when the infection is no longer active (eg, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=poststreptococcal-glomerulonephritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H540849\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Staphylococcus-associated glomerulonephritis is an immune complex-mediated disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcus-associated-glomerulonephritis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The antigen component of the immune complex is derived from the infective agent, similar to poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=poststreptococcal-glomerulonephritis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>The pathogenesis of Staphylococcus-associated glomerulonephritis has not been adequately studied, and it remains largely unknown. It likely involves glomerular deposition of preformed circulating immune complexes. It is possible that in situ immune complex formation may occur (as it does in poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis) due to cationic staphylococcal antigens planted in the glomeruli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcus-associated-glomerulonephritis-in-adults/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. However, glomerular deposition of preformed circulating immune complexes is likely to be a more important pathogenic mechanism in Staphylococcus-associated glomerulonephritis because, in Staphylococcus-associated glomerulonephritis, the circulating antigens and the antibodies directed against these antigens coexist in the circulation for prolonged periods of time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcus-associated-glomerulonephritis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. With this prolonged antigenemia, there is a greater opportunity for immune complexes to form in the circulation, which then deposit causing glomerulonephritis and, in some cases, cutaneous vasculitis.</p><p>Staphylococcus-associated glomerulonephritis requires continued antigen production, and therefore continued active (and usually prolonged) infection, to perpetuate the renal inflammation. If the infection is effectively treated, the activity of the glomerulonephritis should eventually abate. This same paradigm applies to glomerulonephritis due to other non-streptococcal bacteria, viral infections such as hepatitis B and C, and parasitic infections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-disease-in-the-setting-of-infective-endocarditis-or-an-infected-ventriculoatrial-shunt\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal disease in the setting of infective endocarditis or an infected ventriculoatrial shunt&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-renal-disease-associated-with-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of renal disease associated with hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-disease-associated-with-hepatitis-b-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal disease associated with hepatitis B virus infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-classification-and-causes-of-membranoproliferative-glomerulonephritis#H261825925\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, classification, and causes of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis&quot;, section on 'Infections'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=schistosomiasis-and-glomerular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Schistosomiasis and glomerular disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-echinococcosis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of echinococcosis&quot;, section on 'Other organs'</a>.)</p><p>Staphylococcal antigens may act as super antigens, activating T cells which results in polyclonal B-cell activation and production of polyclonal IgA, IgG, and IgM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcus-associated-glomerulonephritis-in-adults/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Some of these antibodies, often IgA, react with staphylococcal antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcus-associated-glomerulonephritis-in-adults/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. This may explain, in part, why glomerular immune deposits in patients with Staphylococcus-associated glomerulonephritis usually show heavy IgA deposits which are dominant or codominant with IgG. In this respect, Staphylococcus-associated glomerulonephritis is distinct from poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis but can be misdiagnosed as primary IgA nephropathy. (See <a href=\"#H1127800411\" class=\"local\">'IgA-dominant Staphylococcus-associated glomerulonephritis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1127800487\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis and evaluation for other causes'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1127798014\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Staphylococcus-associated glomerulonephritis is uncommon and primarily occurs in middle-aged or elderly patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcus-associated-glomerulonephritis-in-adults/abstract/2,9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9-13</a>]. In elderly patients, glomerulonephritis due to bacterial infection may be more often due to <em>Staphylococcus</em> than group A beta-hemolytic <em>Streptococcus</em>. In addition, many affected adults have a predisposition to staphylococcal infection such as diabetes, alcoholism, cancer, or intravenous drug addiction.</p><p>No studies have specifically evaluated the epidemiology of Staphylococcus-associated glomerulonephritis. However, the following study, in which patients with glomerulonephritis due to a variety of bacteria are presented, provides some information about the scope of this disorder.</p><p>In a series of 14,138 native adult kidney biopsies occurring over a 10-year period, 86 patients (0.6 percent) had glomerulonephritis following a bacterial infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcus-associated-glomerulonephritis-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

An infectious agent was not identified in 42 percent, due in at least some patients to prior antibiotic therapy. Among the 50 patients with an identified infectious agent, <em>Staphylococcus</em> accounted for 42 percent overall and was more common than <em>Streptococcus</em> in patients with concurrent diabetic nephropathy, which could be due to a higher incidence of staphylococcal colonization and infection of skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An <strong>immunocompromised</strong> background was present in 38 percent, mostly due to diabetes mellitus (29 percent) or malignancy (5 percent). Diabetes was much more common in patients with staphylococcal than streptococcal infections (67 versus 8 percent).

The findings were generally similar to those in the preceding studies, but staphylococcal infection (almost all <em>S. aureus</em>) was much more common than streptococcal infection (46 versus 16 percent overall, and 69 versus 24 percent in the 72 patients in whom an infectious agent was identified).

These issues are discussed in detail below. (See <a href=\"#H1127800523\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring after diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1127800739\" class=\"local\">'Course'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1127799381\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for kidney biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest that a kidney biopsy be performed in <strong>most adults</strong> suspected of having Staphylococcus-associated glomerulonephritis. Although many patients with poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis do not undergo kidney biopsy, there are several reasons why a biopsy is generally required to make the diagnosis in adults suspected of having Staphylococcus-associated glomerulonephritis.</p><p>These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of glomerulonephritis associated with hypocomplementemia in adults is broad. Causes other than bacterial infection-associated glomerulonephritis include lupus nephritis, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, C3 glomerulonephritis, mixed cryoglobulinemia, and atheroembolic disease which can occasionally present with an active urine sediment. (See <a href=\"#H1127800487\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis and evaluation for other causes'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glomerular-disease-evaluation-and-differential-diagnosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glomerular disease: Evaluation and differential diagnosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Staphylococcus-associated glomerulonephritis is less common than other etiologies among elderly patients who present with urinary findings consistent with glomerulonephritis. As an example, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated pauci-immune glomerulonephritis is much more common in this age group. However, a positive ANCA does not exclude the possibility of staphylococcal-associated disease, particularly in patients with infective endocarditis (IE), which may be associated with positive serologies for ANCA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcus-associated-glomerulonephritis-in-adults/abstract/2,9,11,17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9,11,17-20</a>]. In a series of elderly patients discussed above, ANCA was present in 5 of 66 patients (8 percent) in whom testing was performed, including two patients with staphylococcal pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcus-associated-glomerulonephritis-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Of these five patients, two had diffuse crescentic and necrotizing glomerulonephritis, raising the possibility of concurrent ANCA-mediated disease. However, the positive ANCA may be a response to the infection rather than signalling coexisting ANCA-associated vasculitis. As examples, such cases can resolve with antibiotic therapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcus-associated-glomerulonephritis-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], whereas the addition of glucocorticoids to the antibiotic therapy may worsen the glomerulonephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcus-associated-glomerulonephritis-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The sites of infection in patients with Staphylococcus-associated glomerulonephritis are heterogeneous, and clinical evidence of infection is not present in some cases. As an example, signs of infection (such as fever) are often nonspecific and can be absent in elderly patients. In the study of 109 elderly patients cited above, the onset of clinical renal disease coincided with the first clinical recognition of staphylococcal infection in close to one-half of patients, indicating that the infection may go unrecognized for some time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcus-associated-glomerulonephritis-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p>In patients suspected of having Staphylococcus-associated glomerulonephritis, a kidney biopsy may <strong>not</strong> be required if <strong>all</strong> <strong>three</strong> of the following criteria are satisfied:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is clear evidence of overt glomerulonephritis, marked by glomerular hematuria, heavy proteinuria (greater than 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day),</span> and an abnormally elevated serum creatinine.

Hypertension in patients with Staphylococcus-associated glomerulonephritis (and in most other causes of acute glomerulonephritis) is primarily due to fluid retention, which also is responsible for edema formation. As a result, dietary salt restriction and diuretics, often beginning with loop diuretics, are a reasonable first-line therapy. The goals of diuretic therapy are to control both the hypertension and, if present, edema. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hypertension-in-acute-and-chronic-kidney-disease#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hypertension in acute and chronic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Acute glomerular disease'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hypertension-in-acute-and-chronic-kidney-disease#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hypertension in acute and chronic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Treatment of hypertension in acute glomerular or vascular disease'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hypertension-in-acute-and-chronic-kidney-disease#H140207190\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hypertension in acute and chronic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Use of diuretics and goal of therapy'</a>.)</p><p>If hypertension cannot be controlled in the acute setting with salt restriction and diuretics alone, adding an inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin system (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker) is a reasonable approach since salt restriction and diuretics tend to increase the activity of the renin-angiotensin system, which will increase the antihypertensive response to angiotensin inhibition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hypertension-in-acute-and-chronic-kidney-disease#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hypertension in acute and chronic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Treatment of hypertension in acute glomerular or vascular disease'</a>.)</p><p>If residual renal disease persists after the acute glomerulonephritis has resolved (ie, chronic kidney disease), then inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system are first-line antihypertensive drugs in such patients, particularly in patients with persistent proteinuria above 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>.

In addition, in patients with an active infection, as is often the case in patients with glomerulonephritis due to <em>Staphylococcus</em>, giving high-dose glucocorticoids can lead to worsening of the condition or death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcus-associated-glomerulonephritis-in-adults/abstract/1,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,36,37</a>].</p><p>Data are limited on the efficacy of immunosuppressive therapy in adults with Staphylococcus-associated glomerulonephritis. There are no randomized trials. The best available data come from a retrospective observational study described above of 109 elderly patients with bacterial infection-associated glomerulonephritis, 46 percent of whom had Staphylococcus-associated glomerulonephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcus-associated-glomerulonephritis-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Among the 98 patients with available data, 22 were treated with glucocorticoids for variable periods of time. The indication for glucocorticoid therapy was an elevated serum creatinine with or without crescents. Three patients had a complete remission, twelve had a persistent elevation in serum creatinine, seven progressed to end-stage renal disease, and four died. There was <strong>no</strong> correlation between glucocorticoid therapy and renal outcomes. Lack of benefit has also been noted in other observational studies of patients with bacterial infection-related glomerulonephritis, including Staphylococcus-associated glomerulonephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcus-associated-glomerulonephritis-in-adults/abstract/2,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1127800739\"><span class=\"h1\">COURSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In adults with Staphylococcus-associated glomerulonephritis, successful eradication of the infection should result in resolution of the glomerulonephritis. This resolution is usually manifest by stabilization of the serum creatinine, disappearance of hematuria, and normalization of complement levels, a process that, as discussed above, may take months. (See <a href=\"#H1127800523\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring after diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p>However, many patients with Staphylococcus-associated glomerulonephritis do not have complete resolution of the serum creatinine to their prior baseline and will also have persistent proteinuria. In one study, for example, less than 50 percent of patients (including a variety of infections) attained complete resolution of their serum creatinine, with older age and underlying diabetic kidney disease (both associated with Staphylococcus-associated glomerulonephritis) as predictors of worse outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcus-associated-glomerulonephritis-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The persistent proteinuria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an elevated serum creatinine concentration in such patients is thought to represent irreversible scarring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcus-associated-glomerulonephritis-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. As would be expected from this presentation, the glomerular lesions are mostly inactive and sclerosing, but 6 of 17 patients in one study had minor proliferative lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcus-associated-glomerulonephritis-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Thus, repeat kidney biopsy is usually <strong>not</strong> warranted for persistent mild to moderate proteinuria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a persistently elevated serum creatinine in the <strong>absence</strong> of an active urine sediment or persistent hypocomplementemia since these findings typically represent inactive and fibrotic disease.</p><p>A possible exception to this general recommendation may occur in patients in whom the initial kidney biopsy suggested that C3 glomerulonephritis might be present rather than Staphylococcus-associated glomerulonephritis, although this is much more of an issue with streptococcal infection. The features that help distinguish between these disorders are discussed above. One finding suggestive of C3 glomerulonephritis is persistent or recurrent active glomerulonephritis over a prolonged period which, as described in the next section, is not a characteristic feature of Staphylococcus-associated glomerulonephritis. (See <a href=\"#H1127800516\" class=\"local\">'Distinction from C3 glomerulonephritis'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1127800746\"><span class=\"h2\">Persistent or recurrent disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Persistent or recurrent Staphylococcus-associated glomerulonephritis is uncommon and, as mentioned in the preceding paragraph, should suggest an alternate diagnosis such as C3 glomerulonephritis. Persistent disease can occur with persistent staphylococcal infections, as may be seen with an infected ventriculoatrial shunt, leading to what has been called shunt nephritis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-disease-in-the-setting-of-infective-endocarditis-or-an-infected-ventriculoatrial-shunt#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal disease in the setting of infective endocarditis or an infected ventriculoatrial shunt&quot;, section on 'Clinical features and renal biopsy findings'</a>.)</p><p>However, recurrent disease can occur. In one report, nine such patients were identified at a mean of 3.5 months after the initial kidney biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcus-associated-glomerulonephritis-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Five had recurrent infection due to reactivation of the initial bacterial focus after a course of antibiotics that was too short, and three had a new infection. Microscopic hematuria was present in five, mean protein excretion was 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day,</span> and four patients had the nephrotic syndrome. All nine patients had active glomerulonephritis on repeat renal biopsy; only one patient had interstitial fibrosis, a marker of chronic disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1127800773\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The long-term renal outcomes in patients with bacterial infection-associated glomerulonephritis (ie, not specifically Staphylococcus-associated glomerulonephritis) were evaluated in the study cited above of 86 adults in which 48 had at least three months of follow-up; four patients who had attained complete remission in less than three months were also included [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcus-associated-glomerulonephritis-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The following findings were noted at a mean follow-up of 25 months, according to whether the patient had underlying diabetic nephropathy which, as mentioned above, is associated with staphylococcal disease (see <a href=\"#H1127798014\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among the 41 patients without underlying diabetic nephropathy, 23 (56 percent) attained complete remission, 11 (27 percent) had persistent renal dysfunction, and 7 (17 percent) progressed to end-stage renal disease requiring renal replacement therapy. Older age and a higher serum creatinine at the time of renal biopsy were significant and independent predictors of not attaining complete remission.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The renal outcome was much worse in the 11 patients with underlying diabetic nephropathy, most of whom had Staphylococcus-associated glomerulonephritis: two had persistent renal dysfunction, and nine progressed to end-stage renal disease.

Among 14 patients with follow-up data, three had complete remission, three had persistent renal dysfunction, and eight progressed to end-stage renal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcus-associated-glomerulonephritis-in-adults/abstract/14,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,38,39</a>].</p><p/><p>The renal prognosis also appears to be worse in older patients.

Among these patients, eight (24 percent) had complete recovery of renal function, 11 (32 percent) had persistent renal dysfunction, and 15 (44 percent) progressed to end-stage renal disease, 11 of whom required dialysis at the time of renal biopsy. Other risk factors for the development of end-stage renal disease included the presence of diabetic nephropathy and a higher degree of tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis on renal biopsy, which are markers of chronic disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H156514170\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

The details of the pathogenesis of Staphylococcus-associated glomerulonephritis are not entirely clear. (See <a href=\"#H540849\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Staphylococcus-associated glomerulonephritis is uncommon and primarily occurs in middle-aged or elderly patients. In elderly patients, glomerulonephritis due to bacterial infection may be more often due to <em>Staphylococcus</em> than group A beta-hemolytic <em>Streptococcus</em>. In addition, many affected adults have a predisposition to staphylococcal infection such as diabetes, alcoholism, cancer, or intravenous drug addiction. (See <a href=\"#H1127798014\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adults with Staphylococcus-associated glomerulonephritis usually present with a <strong>concurrent infection</strong> and frequently with hematuria, proteinuria of varying degrees, a rising serum creatinine, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> edema. Cutaneous vasculitis can also occur in patients with Staphylococcus-associated glomerulonephritis, imitating IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura) or antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis. The majority of patients will have hypocomplementemia (usually with a low C3). The most common sites of infection are the <span class=\"nowrap\">skin/wounds,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">pneumonia/pleura,</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">heart/endocarditis,</span> although other sites are possible. An inciting staphylococcal infection can be identified from a positive culture. In some patients, an infectious agent cannot be identified and suspicion of Staphylococcus-associated glomerulonephritis is based upon a probable infection. (See <a href=\"#H1127798317\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of Staphylococcus-associated glomerulonephritis should be suspected in patients with clinical manifestations of active glomerulonephritis (eg, hematuria with or without red cell casts, often accompanied by proteinuria and an elevation in serum creatinine) in conjunction with a known or suspected recent or concurrent staphylococcal infection. A kidney biopsy is often required to make the diagnosis. A <strong>presumptive</strong> diagnosis of Staphylococcus-associated glomerulonephritis can be made if <strong>at least two</strong> of the following criteria are satisfied in a patient with evidence of <em>Staphylococcus</em> infection concurrent with the onset of glomerulonephritis (see <a href=\"#H1127799368\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1127799381\" class=\"local\">'Indications for kidney biopsy'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hypocomplementemia (primarily low C3).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Endocapillary proliferation and exudative glomerulonephritis on light microscopy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F51688\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51688 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>C3 dominant or codominant (with IgG or IgA) glomerular staining on immunofluorescence microscopy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F63432\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63432 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hump-shaped subepithelial deposits on electron microscopy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F76739\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76739 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>However, hypocomplementemia and these pathologic findings are <strong>not</strong> completely specific for glomerulonephritis due to a bacterial infection.

An evaluation for other potential causes of glomerulonephritis should include testing for antinuclear antibodies, anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, ANCA, cryoglobulins, hepatitis B and C, HIV, and, in patients with crescentic disease and a rapidly progressive course, anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies. In addition, if the disease activity does not resolve after successful treatment of the staphylococcal infection, alternative diagnoses should be considered.
