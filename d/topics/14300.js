Angiitis, a synonym for vasculitis, refers generally to blood vessels on both the arterial and venous sides of the circulation.</p><p>Primary angiitis of the CNS (PACNS) is the preferred name for vasculitis that is confined to the CNS. CNS vasculitis is considered secondary when it occurs in the context of a systemic inflammatory disease, such as a systemic vasculitis or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), or an infectious process such as varicella zoster virus.</p><p>PACNS predominantly affects small- and medium-sized arteries of the brain parenchyma, spinal cord, and leptomeninges, resulting in symptoms and signs of CNS dysfunction. It is defined by inflammation of the cerebral vasculature without angiitis in other organs.</p><p>The protean manifestations of PACNS, along with the nonspecificity of available investigational modalities, pose a challenge for accurate diagnosis. Clinicians caring for patients with suspected PACNS should be familiar with its mimics to avoid misdiagnosis. PACNS can be mimicked closely in both its clinical presentation and radiologic manifestations by a number of other disorders. The most frequent mimic of PACNS is a group of disorders known collectively as the reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndromes (RCVS). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reversible-cerebral-vasoconstriction-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and treatment of PACNS will be reviewed here. PACNS in children is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasculitis-in-children-classification-and-incidence#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vasculitis in children: Classification and incidence&quot;, section on 'Primary angiitis of the central nervous system'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H476042046\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS) is a rare disease. A retrospective analysis of 101 patients with PACNS reported an annual incidence rate of 2.4 cases per 1,000,000 person-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. There is a 2:1 male predominance among reported cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The median age at diagnosis is 50 years, although it can occur at almost every age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasculitis-in-children-classification-and-incidence#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vasculitis in children: Classification and incidence&quot;, section on 'Primary angiitis of the central nervous system'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOPATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cause of primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS) is unknown. Several potential etiologic agents or mechanisms have been proposed, but understanding of the cause of PACNS remains highly speculative. Various infectious agents have been proposed as etiologic factors, such as varicella zoster virus, West Nile virus, <em>Mycoplasma gallisepticum</em>, and HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system-in-adults/abstract/3-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-11</a>].</p><p>Cerebral amyloid angiopathy and PACNS have been described together in some patients, and associations between amyloid deposition have also been proposed as a trigger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system-in-adults/abstract/12-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cerebral amyloid angiopathy&quot;, section on 'CAA-related inflammation'</a>.)</p><p>Although the cause of PACNS is unknown, inflammation of the CNS causes the vessels to become narrowed, occluded, and thrombosed, resulting in tissue ischemia and necrosis of the territories of the involved vessels. PACNS is more likely to affect blood vessels in the cerebral cortex and leptomeninges than subcortical regions. Blood vessels supplying cranial nerves may also be involved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS) is characterized by a long prodromal period, with few patients presenting acutely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system-in-adults/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. The vasculitis can affect any part of the CNS, causing the clinical manifestations to be highly variable and nonspecific [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system-in-adults/abstract/2,21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,21-23</a>].</p><p>Headache is the most commonly reported symptom, occurring in about 60 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The headache typically varies in description, but is usually subacute and insidious, in contrast to the sudden-onset thunderclap headache that is observed with reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndromes (RCVS). Other symptoms include cognitive impairment, stroke, and transient ischemic attack, which are present in 30 to 50 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system-in-adults/abstract/1,2,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,19</a>]. Patients with PACNS who develop strokes usually present with more than a single stroke in different anatomic territories.</p><p>Other less common symptoms, including cranial neuropathies, ataxia, seizure, and coma, have been reported. Signs and symptoms suggestive of systemic vasculitis, such as peripheral neuropathy, fever, weight loss, or rash, are usually lacking.</p><p>Spinal cord involvement occurs alone or coincides with parenchymal brain involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Angiitis affecting the spinal cord usually presents as a myelopathy, with pain, motor weakness, and sensory findings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders affecting the spinal cord&quot;, section on 'Spinal cord infarction'</a>.)</p><p>Symptoms and signs of untreated PACNS progress over the course of months. In one series, the mean time from symptom onset to diagnosis was 170 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This is an important contrast to the RCVS, which typically have a more acute onset and much shorter time to diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H854836086\" class=\"local\">'Alternative diagnoses'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reversible-cerebral-vasoconstriction-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS) is challenging as the symptoms are generally nonspecific and there is no specific diagnostic test. The workup for patients who may have PACNS must proceed simultaneously with the systematic evaluation and exclusion of other disorders. (See <a href=\"#H854836086\" class=\"local\">'Alternative diagnoses'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H854837667\"><span class=\"h2\">When to suspect the diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While there is no characteristic presentation of PACNS, there are some scenarios that are highly suspicious. PACNS should be suspected when strokes, more often recurrent, occur in young patients with no identifiable cardiovascular or hypercoagulable risk factors; in the development of cognitive dysfunction with or without headaches; and in recurrent or persistent focal neurologic symptoms, abnormal cerebrovascular imaging obtained in the setting of an unexplained neurological deficit, or unexplained spinal cord dysfunction not associated with systemic disease or any other process.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H854836086\"><span class=\"h2\">Alternative diagnoses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician must remember that when PACNS is suspected, the correct diagnosis is usually something else. As a result, careful exclusion of other disorders is essential. Because of the importance of eliminating a lengthy list of alternative diagnoses, the differential diagnosis of PACNS is discussed in detail below before making the diagnosis.</p><p>The major categories of disease in the differential diagnosis of PACNS are presented below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndromes</strong> &ndash; The RCVS are a group of disorders linked by prolonged but reversible vasoconstriction of the cerebral arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The RCVS are typically associated with severe, acute-onset headaches that can recur intermittently for days to weeks, sometimes accompanied by neurologic symptoms and signs. The headaches associated with the RCVS are usually &quot;thunderclap&quot; in nature. Ischemic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hemorrhagic stroke may occur in the setting of RCVS. Thus, despite the reversibility of vasoconstriction, these disorders are not always characterized by benign prognoses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reversible-cerebral-vasoconstriction-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">While there are some signs and symptoms common to both conditions, including headache, focal deficits, stroke, seizures, and angiographic irregularities, the nature of the headaches and imaging abnormalities are quite different and discussed separately.

The ones most likely to do so are the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Beh&ccedil;et syndrome (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Beh&ccedil;et syndrome&quot;, section on 'Neurologic disease'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Polyarteritis nodosa (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa-in-adults#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa in adults&quot;, section on 'Neurologic disease'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Vasculitides associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, including granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's), microscopic polyangiitis, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-pathology-of-eosinophilic-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-churg-strauss\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and pathology of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cryoglobulins and cryoglobulinemia&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The diagnosis of CNS vasculitis secondary to a systemic form of vasculitis is usually inferred from biopsy or angiography of a non-CNS site. In most such patients, the systemic vasculitis is an established diagnosis before the CNS is involved. We assign high importance to performing a thorough evaluation to exclude an infectious etiology of the CNS process, given the immunosuppressive treatments that patients are usually receiving for their systemic vasculitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Systemic rheumatic diseases </strong>&ndash; CNS manifestations due to other systemic rheumatic diseases may reflect vasculitis or other mechanisms and can occur with or without systemic symptoms. In this setting, diagnosis of the underlying diseases is frequently based upon vasculitic or non-vasculitic clinical features in organs outside the CNS, combined with selected laboratory results. The systemic rheumatic diseases most likely to involve the CNS and create confusion with the diagnosis of PACNS are:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Systemic lupus erythematosus and related conditions &ndash; Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome, mixed connective tissue disease, and dermatomyositis can all be associated with CNS involvement.

The most common microscopic brain finding in SLE is microvasculopathy, described as &quot;healed vasculitis&quot; consistent with hyalinization, thickening, and thrombus formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system-in-adults/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nonvasculitic autoimmune inflammatory meningoencephalitis &ndash; Nonvasculitic autoimmune inflammatory meningoencephalitis (NAIM) is a syndrome characterized clinically by dementia that occurs in some patients with this disorder at a younger age of onset, rapid progression with significant cognitive and behavioral features, absence of family history, abnormal electroencephalography (EEG) findings, and elevated levels of inflammatory markers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The CNS involvement that may be seen in Hashimoto thyroiditis is considered as a form of NAIM. The pathologic findings of NAIM are those of a panencephalitis without evidence of a vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Patients with NAIM are usually successfully treated with glucocorticoids. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hashimoto-encephalopathy#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hashimoto encephalopathy&quot;, section on 'Nonvasculitic autoimmune inflammatory meningoencephalitis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Rheumatoid arthritis &ndash; Rheumatoid vasculitis occasionally involves the CNS. However, the most common neurologic manifestation of rheumatoid vasculitis is vasculitic neuropathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatoid-vasculitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rheumatoid vasculitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Antiphospholipid syndrome &ndash; The antiphospholipid syndrome can cause CNS dysfunction due to strokes caused by intracerebral clotting events, emboli associated with verrucous endocarditis, and white matter lesions suggestive of a vasculopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of antiphospholipid syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Many but not all cases of the Sneddon syndrome, the combination of livedo reticularis and cerebrovascular lesions, are associated with antiphospholipid antibodies. However, the Sneddon syndrome is unlikely to be confused with PACNS if the livedo reticularis is appreciated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Infection</strong> &ndash; A number of bacterial, mycobacterial, viral, fungal, and rickettsial infections can mimic PACNS. Prompt culture of all potential sites of infection, including the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), is therefore essential. Organisms that cause subacute or chronic infections are the ones most likely to imitate PACNS. The major organisms of concern are:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><em>Treponema pallidum.</em> (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurosyphilis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurosyphilis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><em>Borrelia burgdorferi.</em> (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-lyme-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Lyme disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><em>Bartonella</em> species.

Cysticercosis is endemic in many regions of Central and South America, sub-Saharan Africa, India, and Asia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cysticercosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cysticercosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Atherosclerosis</strong> &ndash; Atherosclerosis of intracranial vessels can mimic the angiographic findings of PACNS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system-in-adults/abstract/2,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,31</a>]. The patient with multiple atherosclerotic risk factors and CNS dysfunction such as evidence of a cerebrovascular accident is much more likely to have atherosclerosis than PACNS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cerebral emboli </strong>&ndash; Cerebral emboli can result in multifocal vascular occlusions that suggest the diagnosis of vasculitis. As many as 30 to 40 percent of ischemic strokes remain cryptogenic despite the availability of transesophageal echocardiography, carotid ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) to help identify embolic sources. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cryptogenic-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cryptogenic stroke&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-evaluation-of-stroke#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the evaluation of stroke&quot;, section on 'Embolic stroke'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Various types of embolic events can create confusion with PACNS. These include paradoxical emboli in patients with patent foramen ovale as well as emboli in patients with atrial fibrillation, atrial myxoma, and nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonbacterial-thrombotic-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-atrial-fibrillation#H1052524380\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of atrial fibrillation&quot;, section on 'Embolization'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patent-foramen-ovale#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patent foramen ovale&quot;, section on 'Cryptogenic stroke'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Atheroemboli are another cause of embolic stroke that may be confused with PACNS. Atheroemboli are often released from vessels other than the carotid arteries (especially the aorta), with a predilection for the middle cerebral artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Systemic signs of atheroembolism (eg, livedo reticularis, acute renal failure), if present, would exclude PACNS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Embolism from atherosclerotic plaque: Atheroembolism (cholesterol crystal embolism)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intravascular lymphoma</strong> &ndash; Intravascular lymphoma that leads to widespread occlusion of small vessels is an occasional mimicker of PACNS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system-in-adults/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. Appropriate immunohistochemistry staining as well as B- and T-cell markers should be performed on biopsy specimens even with the pathologic finding of angiitis, since the presence of vasculitic changes does not exclude an underlying lymphoproliferative condition. Lymph node, bone marrow, and CSF involvement may not be evident at presentation, as delays of up to five years have been reported before the emergence of extracranial disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Many patients with carotid or vertebral artery dissections progress to cerebral ischemia. The combination of headache followed by stroke mimics PACNS.

MRI should be performed in all patients with PACNS. The selection of additional neuroimaging modalities depends on the initial MRI findings and individual patient characteristics. Some clinicians may choose to order an MRA at the same time as the initial MRI out of convenience because the patient is in the scanner, though it lacks both sensitivity and specificity for PACNS. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) may be more sensitive for detecting vascular irregularities than MRA, but is far less sensitive than catheter-based angiography.

MRI of the brain commonly shows multiple infarcts in multiple vascular territories, and often in areas of the brain not affected by more common causes of stroke (such as the corpus callosum). However, these findings are not specific for PACNS and the interpretation of MRI findings should be performed by an expert neuroradiologist who is familiar with the findings of CNS vasculitis and its radiologic mimics. In addition, there may rarely be tumor-like lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system-in-adults/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>].

MRA and CTA are most reliable for the assessment of the large proximal arteries and therefore are inadequate for the demonstration of more distal vasculopathy. Notably, the finding of narrowing of multiple large proximal intracranial arteries as detected by MRA or CTA should suggest an alternative diagnosis, such as atherosclerosis, dissection, moyamoya disease, or reversible cerebral vasoconstriction in the appropriate clinical setting.

Other findings include circumferential or eccentric vessel irregularities. While the findings are characteristic of cerebral arteritis, these findings are not specific, and may be encountered in non-vasculitic disorders such as atherosclerosis and vasospasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. PACNS has a host of potential mimickers of its angiographic features (see <a href=\"#H854836086\" class=\"local\">'Alternative diagnoses'</a> above). In addition, angiographic findings interpreted as &quot;consistent with vasculitis&quot; greatly outnumber true cases of PACNS. Thus, a positive angiogram does not make the diagnosis of PACNS. In a study of 38 patients with suspected PACNS, 14 patients had typical angiographic findings of vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

A brain biopsy should be performed in most patients with suspected PACNS. A biopsy will help histologically identify PACNS as well as exclude other lesions or vasculitis mimics, particularly infection or malignancy. Sampling of the leptomeninges as well as the underlying cortex increases the diagnostic yield; however, the test characteristics of the brain biopsy are far from optimal. The sensitivity of brain biopsy for PACNS is approximately 75 percent, thus leaving the clinician with a false negative rate of 25 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. A meta-analysis revealed a diagnostic yield of 74.7 percent (95% CI 64.0-84.1 percent) for suspected PACNS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

In other words, a brain biopsy not only establishes a diagnosis in the setting of suspected PACNS in roughly 70 percent of cases but also may provide an alternative diagnosis in a fair number of patients.</p><p>There are two settings of particular concern where obtaining tissue is paramount:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of a focal lesion on MR with characteristics that suggest an inflammatory or infectious process, but noninvasive approaches to diagnosis have failed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of a mass lesion in the brain for which the principal concern is usually malignancy or abscess.

It is defined by inflammation of the cerebral vasculature without angiitis in other organs. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PACNS is a rare disease, and the cause is unknown. The median age at diagnosis is 50 years, although it can occur at almost every age. (See <a href=\"#H476042046\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Etiopathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PACNS is characterized by a long prodromal period, with few patients presenting acutely. The vasculitis can affect any part of the CNS, causing the clinical manifestations to be highly variable and nonspecific. The most commonly reported symptom is a subacute and insidious headache. Other symptoms include cognitive impairment, stroke, and transient ischemic attack. Patients with PACNS who develop strokes usually present with more than a single stroke in different anatomic areas. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of PACNS is challenging as the symptoms are generally nonspecific and there is no specific diagnostic test. The workup for patients who may have PACNS must proceed simultaneously with the systematic evaluation and exclusion of other disorders. While there is no characteristic presentation, there are some scenarios that are highly suspicious. PACNS should be suspected when strokes, more often recurrent, occur in young patients with no identifiable cardiovascular or hypercoagulable risk factors; or in the setting of chronic meningitis, recurrent focal neurologic symptoms, unexplained diffuse neurologic dysfunction, abnormal cerebrovascular imaging obtained in the setting of an unexplained neurological deficit, or unexplained spinal cord dysfunction not associated with systemic disease or any other process. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> above and <a href=\"#H854837667\" class=\"local\">'When to suspect the diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients in whom a diagnosis of PACNS is suspected, an alternative diagnosis is more likely to be correct. As a result, careful exclusion of other disorders is essential. The most common clinical and radiologic mimickers are the reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndromes (RCVS). Other alternative diagnoses include systemic rheumatic diseases and vasculitides, infection, atherosclerosis, cerebral emboli, intravascular lymphoma, and moyamoya. (See <a href=\"#H854836086\" class=\"local\">'Alternative diagnoses'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory testing and serological assays are used primarily to exclude other etiologies of CNS dysfunction. Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a crucial part of the evaluation of patients with potential PACNS and should be performed in all patents unless there are contraindications. The CSF is abnormal in 80 to 90 percent of patients with pathologically documented disease. CSF findings are nonspecific but most commonly include an elevated CSF protein and a modest lymphocytic pleocytosis. (See <a href=\"#H1123088451\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory testing to exclude alternative diagnoses'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Lumbar puncture'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Various neuroimaging modalities can be used to assess for both parenchymal and vascular abnormalities in the evaluation of suspected PACNS. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be performed in all patients. The selection of additional neuroimaging modalities depends on the initial MRI findings and individual patient characteristics. Conventional angiography remains an important part of the diagnostic testing for suspected PACNS, and our authors obtain angiography in patients who have MRI findings of multiple cortical and subcortical infarcts that are otherwise unexplained. Angiography can detect segmental narrowing in multiple vessels that are typical of, though not pathognomonic for, PACNS, and help further rule out alternative diagnoses such as atherosclerosis, moyamoya, and dissection. These tests may also be helpful in selecting a location for brain biopsy if needed. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Neuroimaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A brain biopsy should be performed in most patients with suspected PACNS. A biopsy will help histologically identify PACNS as well as exclude other lesions or vasculitis mimics, particularly infection or malignancy. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Brain and leptomeningeal biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of PACNS is based upon a constellation of symptoms and signs in the setting of supportive studies, and the exclusion of alternative diagnoses. The diagnosis can usually be made when all of the following are present (see <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Establishing the diagnosis'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An acquired otherwise unexplained neurological deficit</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Evidence of either classic angiographic or histopathologic features of angiitis within the CNS</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>No evidence of systemic vasculitis or any other condition that could elicit the angiographic or pathologic findings</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are patients in whom the diagnosis of PACNS is made without all the meeting the criteria described above. In such scenarios, the term <span class=\"nowrap\">&quot;atypical/possible</span> PACNS&quot; has been used to describe the uncertainty about the diagnosis or the variation from the typical pathologic findings. This usually includes lymphocytic PACNS, angiographically defined PACNS, and a mass lesion presentation. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Establishing the diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest treating PACNS with a combination of glucocorticoids and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Treatment of atypical PACNS should be individualized according to the severity and the extent of the neurologic deficit. (See <a href=\"#H32\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of PACNS'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend the use of measures to prevent osteoporosis and <em>Pneumocystis</em> infections during the treatment of PACNS (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H35\" class=\"local\">'Prophylactic therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The response to treatment is monitored by periodic reassessment of symptoms, neurologic findings, and neuroimaging abnormalities.
