The mediator involved in this process was interleukin (IL)-33 from dendritic cells, which in turn increased the production of IL-4 from basophils that lead to the upregulation of the Fc-gamma-RIIB receptor on effector macrophages and the inhibitory anti-inflammatory effects. Although the data in human autoimmune disease are limited, the peripheral blood monocytes in patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) treated with high-dose IVIG showed upregulation of the Fc-gamma-RIIB receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intravenous-immune-globulin-ivig-therapy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supply of anti-idiotypic antibodies directed against idiotypes on circulating autoantibodies.

In a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, IVIG abrogated disease progression by expanding CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup> Tregs and inhibiting the proinflammatory Th17 pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intravenous-immune-globulin-ivig-therapy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. This mechanism of IVIG was not dependent on the Fc domain and sialylation. Other models have demonstrated a requirement for IgG sialylation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intravenous-immune-globulin-ivig-therapy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Many animal models have shown that IVIG promotes expansion of FoxP3<sup>+</sup> Tregs and downregulates the Th17 pathway. The mechanism by which IVIG induces Tregs may be through the prostaglandin E2 pathway as demonstrated in human dendritic cells in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intravenous-immune-globulin-ivig-therapy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

This may occur through increases in the total plasma concentration of IgG, which saturate the FcRn receptor on vascular endothelial cells of the IgG transport system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intravenous-immune-globulin-ivig-therapy/abstract/19,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,31,32</a>]. Once this receptor becomes saturated, IgG is no longer protected and is degraded according to its relative serum level. The FcRn receptor accounts for the long half-life of serum IgG. This mechanism accounted for approximately 50 percent of the enhanced clearance of antiplatelet antibodies in a mouse model of ITP, and it may partially account for the long-term effects of IVIG in ITP. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-initial-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adults: Initial treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Given the multiple anti-inflammatory effects of IVIG, probably more than one mechanism is responsible for its immune modulating effects in autoimmune disease. In any given disease state, it is not clear whether all the IgG molecules present in the polyclonal IgG preparation (or only a small sub-fraction of the IgG molecules) are responsible for the clinically beneficial effect. For example, when IVIG is used to neutralize certain autoantibodies or anti-HLA antibodies, only that small fraction of IgG molecules with specific anti-idiotypic activity are likely to be needed. In addition, laboratory evidence suggests that some IgG molecules with heavily sialylated Fc regions may preferentially exert anti-inflammatory effects. Nevertheless, available commercial products are not characterized for, nor differentiated by, their content of antibodies of different specificities or chemical compositions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Uses for IVIG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Immune globulin</a> may be administered as a component of therapy for the following conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intravenous-immune-globulin-ivig-therapy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunodeficiency states</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Primary <span class=\"nowrap\">(congenital/hereditary)</span> immunodeficiencies &ndash;

This may identify pre-existing infection or risk for complications (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intravenous immune globulin: Adverse effects&quot;</a>) before the IVIG is administered and allows appropriate evaluation if required.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For individuals with abnormal baseline testing, evaluation for bloodborne pathogens may be appropriate (eg, hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]). When indicated, testing for bloodborne pathogens should be done before starting IVIG therapy because serologic and nucleic acid tests (NAT) will become positive following IVIG administration due to the passively transferred antibodies in the IVIG, especially common viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and hepatitis B virus (HBV). However, urgent therapy should not be delayed for this testing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The overall risk of transmission of viruses or other pathogens from IVIG is extremely low (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects#H30\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intravenous immune globulin: Adverse effects&quot;, section on 'Infectious risks'</a>). In most cases, this information is useful for identifying infections that require treatment rather than for &quot;look back&quot; purposes, in which attempts are made to identify a specific donor responsible for the transmission. Such lookback studies are extremely difficult, if not impossible, when dealing with a product in which plasma components from thousands of donors is pooled.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Individuals with hypogammaglobulinemia (eg, primary immunodeficiencies) should be evaluated using NAT-based testing because they may have impaired production of specific antibodies, and serologic testing will be uninformative.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Individuals without hypogammaglobulinemia can be evaluated using serologic or NAT-based testing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some individuals with normal baseline testing may also benefit from information about pre-existing viral infections.

The intervention for positive Coombs testing depends on whether the finding was expected (eg, known autoimmune hemolytic anemia) or unexpected.

Cold alcohol fractionation (by the Cohn or Kistler-Nitschmann procedures) is used to isolate the immunoglobulin-containing fraction. This is followed by further purification techniques, including additional precipitation steps to remove non-immunoglobulin G (IgG) proteins and ion exchange chromatography to further separate and purify the desired IgG. Most <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> preparations also undergo several specific treatments to inactivate or remove bloodborne pathogens that could be present. These include low pH treatment, fatty <span class=\"nowrap\">acid/alcohol</span> treatment, solvent-detergent treatment, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> heat treatment (pasteurization). All products undergo nanofiltration or depth filtration to remove potential prions from the donor plasma. These processes are reviewed in more detail elsewhere.

However, there are slight differences in the manufacturing procedures used by different producers, and different stabilizers (eg, sucrose, glucose, maltose) are used in the excipients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F68573\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68573 \">table 1</a>). Many available products use amino acids such as glycine or proline to stabilize or prevent aggregation of the IgG molecules in IVIG. The sodium content of different products also varies. Products also differ in storage requirements and shelf life.</p><p>These refinements were made following the experience with earlier preparations used in the 1950s and 1960s, which were effective in the treatment of sepsis and viral infections but were associated with severe anaphylactic reactions thought to be due to highly vasoactive peptides and IgG aggregates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intravenous-immune-globulin-ivig-therapy/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H396565\"><span class=\"h1\">SELECTING A PRODUCT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of patients tolerate most IVIG products with a minimum of adverse events when an acceptable infusion rate is used. Thus, for many patients, selection of a product to conform to local dispensing or formulary preferences is appropriate, particularly when a limited duration of therapy is anticipated. However, there are some circumstances in which one product may be more suitable than another for a given patient. For example, patients with underlying renal disease should not get sugar-containing IVIG (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F68573\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68573 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H399027\"><span class=\"h2\">Selection of IVIG versus other routes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> products are labeled for a specific route of administration (eg, intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular). Several 10 percent IVIG solutions can be administered subcutaneously, and reports suggest that most intravenous products are well tolerated by the subcutaneous route [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intravenous-immune-globulin-ivig-therapy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

The subcutaneous route causes fewer systemic adverse effects and provides more stable serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels of immune globulin compared with the intravenous route, as discussed separately.

The requirement for a product low in IgA is unpredictable, as most IgA-deficient patients tolerate products that contain IgA. Most clinicians choose a product with very low IgA content when treating an autoimmune process in a patient with undetectable levels of IgA.

Hydration should be given before IVIG preparations containing sucrose, as well.</p><p>Hydration can be accomplished by ample oral fluid intake or by administration of normal saline before giving the IVIG. Most clinicians administer intravenous fluids before starting high-dose IVIG, as therapy may be associated with adverse effects due to hyperviscosity, and preparations containing sucrose have been associated with osmotic renal damage. Normal saline 10 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> is suggested for this purpose.

Bolus doses may be given every three to four weeks. Typical starting doses are in the range of 400 to 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span>. Depending on the patient&rsquo;s progress (eg, infections), dosing can be adjusted. Some patients may need higher or more frequent doses to remain free from acute infections; to control chronic infections, particularly of the sino-pulmonary tract; <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> to maintain target serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels. As such, dosing is quite variable among patients in that each patient may have their own dosing requirements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intravenous-immune-globulin-ivig-therapy/abstract/56,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,59</a>]. Compared with subcutaneous dosing given more frequently, bolus IV dosing yields lower serum levels of IgG at the end of each dosing interval as the time for the next dose nears. Some patients will become more susceptible to infections during this period or feel otherwise unwell; this is commonly called &quot;wear-off.&quot; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-therapy-in-primary-immunodeficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune globulin therapy in primary immunodeficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The use of subcutaneous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a>, including hyaluronidase- and nonhyaluronidase-containing preparations, is reviewed in detail separately.

Other approaches include measuring specific antibodies to pneumococcal polysaccharides or the IgG3 subclass, since this IgG subclass has the shortest half-life. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-therapy-in-primary-immunodeficiency#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune globulin therapy in primary immunodeficiency&quot;, section on 'Trough levels'</a>.)</p><p>The rationale for measuring trough levels (or steady state IgG levels) is that the rate of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> metabolism may vary with the clinical state. One study, for example, evaluated 15 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who were given 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of IVIG every three weeks; the mean half-life was 39.1 days (standard deviation = 9.6 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intravenous-immune-globulin-ivig-therapy/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. This is longer than the half-life of approximately three to four weeks observed in patients with primary immunodeficiencies or in healthy volunteers given IVIG. The rate of metabolism does not appear to increase with chronic administration. However, detailed pharmacokinetic studies are not available in patients with autoimmune diseases given repeated high dosages of IVIG.</p><p>In contrast, it is not established that measurement of IgG levels is relevant in patients with autoimmune disorders, where the endpoint is clinical improvement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H164067\"><span class=\"h2\">Infusion rates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many infusion-related adverse effects seem related to the rate of administration. Therefore, it is customary to start each IVIG infusion at a slow rate, such as 0.01 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per minute, which would provide 0.5 or 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> per minute depending upon whether a 5 or 10 percent solution is being infused, respectively. The infusion rate may then be increased at 20- to 30-minute intervals, while monitoring the patient closely for alterations in vital signs or subjective symptoms.</p><p>If the patient continues to do well, the rate of infusion may be increased. The specific increments and infusion rates should conform to the product information for the product being administered. We commonly increase the rate to 0.02 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per minute, then 0.04 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per minute, and in one or two additional increments until a maximum rate of 0.08 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per minute (4 or 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per minute if 5 percent or 10 percent solutions are used, respectively) is achieved.</p><p>Higher rates may be tolerated in selected patients and with preparations that are low in sodium <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> free of high concentrations of sugar as stabilizers. After it has been established that a given patient tolerates a certain product at a specific rate, fewer steps <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> shorter intervals may be used during the &quot;ramp up,&quot; but patients should always be monitored closely because lot-to-lot and patient-to-patient variation in tolerability may occur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3007154\"><span class=\"h2\">Dosing in obese patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is insufficient evidence upon which to base recommendations for dosing in obese or morbidly obese patients, and there is no clearly defined standard approach. A reasonable approach would be to start with a dose based on ideal body weight (IBW) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-ideal-body-weight-method-of-devine-and-dosing-weight-for-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) or adjusted body weight (also called dosing weight) and then modify the dose further based upon the patient's clinical response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intravenous-immune-globulin-ivig-therapy/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine monitoring for development of complications of IVIG therapy and bloodborne infections is recommended every 6 to 12 months.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As described above, pretreatment testing is done to evaluate hematologic parameters, renal function, metabolic status, glucose, and possible infections such as hepatitis.

Thus, when high-dose IVIG is to be given over two or more days for treating autoimmune disorders, it is prudent to check for a drop in hemoglobin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> Coombs positivity before proceeding with the second or subsequent doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intravenous-immune-globulin-ivig-therapy/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a previously negative Coombs test becomes positive, options include using a different IVIG preparation and delaying or fractionating the remaining dose; the patient should be well hydrated and monitored closely for hemolysis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11541199\"><span class=\"h1\">VACCINATION OF PATIENTS RECEIVING IVIG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Administration of IVIG may interfere with the efficacy of vaccinations because the antibodies in the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> may bind to the antigenic substance in the vaccine and interfere with the normal immune response to the vaccination. This is particularly problematic in patients who received live virus vaccines such as measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) or varicella vaccines while on or within months after receiving IVIG, since the passively transferred immunoglobulin G (IgG) may prevent the viral replication that is necessary for inducing the desired immune response. In addition, individuals with underlying immune deficiency may have an immunologic defect that blunts the immune response to vaccination independent of IVIG administration. The American Academy of Pediatrics has made specific recommendations for administration of live vaccines against measles and varicella in individuals receiving IVIG. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measles-mumps-and-rubella-immunization-in-infants-children-and-adolescents#H1276241973\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measles, mumps, and rubella immunization in infants, children, and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Recent receipt of blood or immune globulin'</a>.)</p><p>In selected cases (eg, vaccination during a period of IVIG administration for an autoimmune disorder), it may make sense to check titers following vaccination six months after IVIG has been discontinued to determine whether the patient has protective immunity and to re-immunize if the titers are not protective. However, we would not discontinue IVIG in a patient with immunodeficiency solely to assess vaccine efficacy.</p><p>Firm recommendations regarding influenza virus immunization are challenging because of a lack of comprehensive data and antigenic variability of the viruses from year to year. To the extent that new antigens arise each year, immunization with inactivated vaccine may induce some protective antibody that is not present in the donor plasma pool. Data correlating the response to inactivated influenza vaccines with the timing after IVIG administration are lacking, but if the antigens in any given vaccine are unique, exogenous IVIG should not interfere with the host's ability to respond, if that is intact. IVIG is unlikely to interfere with local replication of attenuated live (nasal) vaccines, however, these are not usually recommended for immunodeficient patients. Many clinicians give <a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-virus-vaccine-inactivated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">inactivated influenza vaccine</a> to patients receiving IVIG therapy to stimulate T cell immunity to the virus, which may help in recovery from influenza.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H164407\"><span class=\"h1\">CONSENT AND RECORD KEEPING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some institutions require signed consent before any blood product or blood derivative is administered.
