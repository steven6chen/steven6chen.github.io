VPBs are common and occur in a broad spectrum of the population. This includes patients without structural heart disease and those with any form of cardiac disease, independent of severity.</p><p>The prevalence, mechanisms, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of VPBs will be presented here. A discussion of supraventricular premature beats is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=supraventricular-premature-beats\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Supraventricular premature beats&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H856328744\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lown's grading of VPBs into six categories was initially proposed as a prognostic classification, but it has become clear over the years that this pertains only to acute myocardial infarction and ischemia and bears <strong>no prognostic relevance</strong> in other situations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-premature-beats/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Prognosis relates only to the underlying structural heart disease and the degree of any left ventricular dysfunction, not to the complexity of the VPBs. Nevertheless, it has served as a descriptive reference point of communicating the complexity of ventricular ectopy. The following six grades have been included in this type of classification: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 0 &ndash; No VPBs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade I &ndash; Unifocal and infrequent VPBs; &lt;30 VPBs per hour</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade II &ndash; Unifocal and frequent VPBs; &ge;30 VPBs per hour</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade III &ndash; Multifocal VPBs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade IVA &ndash; Two consecutive VPBs (couplets)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade IVB &ndash; Three or more consecutive VPBs <span class=\"nowrap\">(salvos/nonsustained</span> ventricular tachycardia)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade V &ndash; &quot;R-on-T&quot; phenomenon</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of VPBs is directly related to the study population, the detection method, and the duration of observation. In patients with no known heart disease, VPBs occur in approximately 1 percent of routine 12-lead ECG of 30 to 60 seconds duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-premature-beats/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. By comparison, when 24-hour ambulatory monitoring is used, up to 80 percent of apparently healthy people have occasional VPBs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-premature-beats/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. There is an age-related increase in the prevalence of VPBs in normal individuals and those with underlying heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-premature-beats/abstract/2,5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5-7</a>]. The occurrence of frequent VPBs accounting for more than 20 percent of overall heart beats is rare, seen in less than 2 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-premature-beats/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The following findings were noted in a review of 15,792 middle-aged subjects (45 to 65 years of age) in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-premature-beats/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The overall prevalence of any VPB on a two-minute electrocardiogram (ECG) was approximately 6 percent; the prevalence of more frequent or complex VPBs (multiformed, couplets, or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia) was approximately 3 and 0.8 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VPBs were more frequent in men than women, in African-Americans compared with whites, and in those with organic heart disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prevalence of VPBs increased with age (34 percent increase for each five-year increment in age) and in the presence of other factors, such as faster sinus rate, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypertension.</p><p/><p>However, prevalence estimates in epidemiologic studies are of uncertain accuracy since the ability to detect VPBs is dependent upon the duration of observation. The longer an individual is monitored (eg, 24 hours of ambulatory monitoring), the more likely that VPBs will be detected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS FOR VPBS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since invasive testing is rarely performed in patients with only simple VPBs, there is little information about the mechanisms of VPBs in humans. Information derived from experiments in animals suggests that the mechanisms by which VPBs are generated include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reentry</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enhanced normal or abnormal automaticity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Triggered activity resulting from afterdepolarizations</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9829334\"><span class=\"h2\">Reentry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reentry is the most common mechanism for VPBs. Reentrant VPBs occur with conduction delay and unidirectional block, settings that are characteristically seen in patients with a healed myocardial infarction or evidence of myocardial fibrosis of any etiology. A wave front may then perpetuate under the correct set of circumstances, such as the administration of a drug that prolongs conduction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reentry-and-the-development-of-cardiac-arrhythmias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reentry and the development of cardiac arrhythmias&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Enhanced automaticity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abnormal automaticity is most probable with electrolyte abnormalities or acute ischemia and is enhanced by catecholamines. These conditions tend to lower the diastolic transmembrane voltage, resulting in premature depolarization. The principal site of VPB development due to abnormal automaticity is the Purkinje fiber layer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enhanced-cardiac-automaticity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Enhanced cardiac automaticity&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Triggered activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Triggered activity is a more common mechanism for VPB development in humans than was previously appreciated. Early or late afterdepolarizations may occur in Purkinje cells or in the ventricular myocardium; such electrical activity may arise because of a number of conditions, including hypokalemia, ischemia, infarction, cardiomyopathy, excess calcium, and drug toxicity (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> or agents that prolong repolarization or the QT interval). If repetitive firing allows these afterdepolarizations to reach threshold potential, VPBs will be generated and may perpetuate if the proper conditions are present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of VPBs is associated with several characteristic findings on history, physical examination, and electrocardiogram (ECG). Their occurrence may also be the only indication for the presence of a variety of inherited and acquired forms of heart disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15572007\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While VPBs can and do occur sporadically at some point in nearly all persons, certain conditions are associated with more frequent VPBs. Examples of conditions in which VPBs are frequently seen include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertension with left ventricular hypertrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-premature-beats/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute myocardial infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-premature-beats/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-premature-beats/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-premature-beats/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-premature-beats/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Congenital heart disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Idiopathic ventricular tachycardia</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H856328750\"><span class=\"h2\">Other conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sleep apnea syndromes, pulmonary hypertension, other pulmonary diseases, and endocrinopathies (thyroid, adrenal or gonadal abnormalities) can all be associated with VPBs. Nicotine, alcohol, or other stimulants, such as sympathomimetic agents (eg, beta-agonists, decongestants, antihistamines) or illicit drugs (eg, cocaine, amphetamines) can trigger VPBs. In hospitalized patients, sleep disruption has been associated with an increased hourly number of VPBs during the night, with more pronounced exacerbation of ventricular ectopy the next day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-premature-beats/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Although there is a widespread belief that caffeine, particularly at high doses, is associated with palpitations and a number of arrhythmias, there is no evidence that it is proarrhythmic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-premature-beats/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In a study of 1388 participants in the Cardiovascular Health Study, in which caffeine consumption was self-reported and patients underwent 24-hour ambulatory monitoring, there was no significant differences in the frequency of VPBs between users and non-users of caffeine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-premature-beats/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Additionally, more frequent consumption of caffeine is this study was not associated with more ectopy. Nevertheless, there are patients who may be more sensitive to caffeine and note a relationship of palpitations to caffeine intake.</p><p>The effects of female sex hormones on VPBs were reported in a group of 20 women with VPBs, in whom the number of VPBs was significantly decreased during the ovulation period (86 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/day)</span> compared with the number of VPBs in the menstruation period (210 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/day)</span>. VPB frequency decreased with estradiol peak in the ovulation period, suggesting that estrogens may have protective effects against ventricular arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-premature-beats/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p>A greater discussion of the relevance of VPBs in various clinical conditions can be found in the specific topics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>VPBs produce few or no symptoms in the vast majority of patients, although some individuals may be incapacitated by palpitations or dizziness. VPBs rarely cause true hemodynamic compromise, except when they occur frequently in a patient with severely depressed left ventricular function or when they are associated with an underlying bradycardia.</p><p>The most common symptoms resulting from VPBs are palpitations secondary to the hypercontractility of a post-VPB beat or a feeling that the heart has stopped secondary to a post-VPB pause. Less often, frequent VPBs can result in a pounding sensation in the neck, lightheadedness, or near syncope. There is great variability as to when the symptoms are most prominent, although a quiet environment, such as at night while lying in bed, may make patients more aware of their ectopy. They are often more frequently appreciated when subjects are lying on their left side and the heart is closer to the chest wall. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-palpitations-in-adults#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of palpitations in adults&quot;, section on 'Description'</a>.)</p><p>On occasion, patients are incapacitated by palpitations or dizziness related to VPBs. Palpitations often provoke a great deal of anxiety that, in turn, may cause a vicious cycle of anxiety, catecholamine surges, and additional ectopy and palpitations. Patients may therefore report dizziness unrelated to any fall in cerebral perfusion pressure or blood flow. Gentle reassurance is of most benefit in these circumstances.</p><p>Frequent VPBs have been associated with a reversible cardiomyopathy, even in the absence of sustained ventricular arrhythmias or symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-premature-beats/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In general, this condition may be underestimated. In an analysis of a large population-based database, a VPB diagnosis was encountered in 35,817 (0.2 percent) of the 16.8 million patients experiencing 48.1 million hospitalizations, while systolic heart failure developed in 198,818 (1.2 percent) patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-premature-beats/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. VPBs were associated with a nearly twofold risk of systolic heart failure. This effect was most pronounced in younger patients without comorbidities, suggesting that VPBs may be an important cause of &quot;idiopathic&quot; heart failure.</p><p>VPB-related cardiomyopathy should be suspected in individuals who present with an unexplained cardiomyopathy and very frequent unifocal VPBs (typically &gt;20 percent of all beats). Elimination of VPBs using catheter ablation or medications often leads to normalization of cardiac function. This is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arrhythmia-induced-cardiomyopathy#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy&quot;, section on 'Frequent ventricular ectopy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most characteristic finding on physical exam is the presence of an irregular pulse resulting from the presence of VPBs during the examination. Atrioventricular dissociation (if present) will result in variable intensity of the first heart sound (secondary to a changing PR interval) and in cannon &quot;A&quot; waves (due to almost simultaneous retrograde atrial and antegrade ventricular activation). The splitting of the second heart sound (S2) will also vary, depending upon whether the VPB has a right or left bundle branch morphology; a widely split S2 due to a delayed P2 may be appreciated if a right bundle branch block VPB occurs. An auscultated fully compensatory pause is present with most VPBs and is identified by the prolonged pause following the premature beat. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-heart-sounds\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of heart sounds&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3566020\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnostic evaluation of patients with symptoms suggesting VPBs should focus on documenting their presence or absence with an electrocardiogram (ECG) or some form of ambulatory cardiac monitoring. Once VPBs have been identified, an additional evaluation should be performed focusing on the presence or absence of underlying structural heart disease.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients in whom VPBs are suspected but not yet documented, an ECG should be performed, preferably while symptomatic if symptoms are present. Due to the brief nature of the test, VPBs may not be recorded during a standard ECG. In such cases, ambulatory monitoring should be performed, initially for 24 or 48 hours or, if necessary, for up to 30 days, which will significantly increase the likelihood of detecting VPBs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ambulatory-ecg-monitoring\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ambulatory ECG monitoring&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients in whom otherwise unexplained VPBs have been identified, the following evaluation should be performed:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>24-hour ambulatory (Holter) monitor to quantify the frequency of VPBs and determine if they are monomorphic or multimorphic.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Echocardiography to assess cardiac structure and function.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Exercise treadmill stress test to evaluate the response of the VPBs to exercise, determine the VPB morphology, determine if sustained or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) can be induced with exercise, as well as to screen for underlying ischemia. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Correctable causes or triggers should be sought by clinical history (inquiring about possible underlying cardiovascular diseases, but also about use of alcohol or caffeine-containing beverages, or illicit drugs, etc) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> laboratory testing (electrolyte levels, thyroid stimulating hormone [TSH]). For documented nocturnal VPBs, sleep apnea needs to be considered and polysomnography performed, when indicated. (See <a href=\"#H15572007\" class=\"local\">'Associated conditions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H856328750\" class=\"local\">'Other conditions'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Further testing is indicated only when this initial evaluation identifies significant abnormalities that require further evaluation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An ECG should be part of the standard evaluation for any patient with suspected VPBs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57511\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef57511 \">waveform 1</a>). VPBs have the following ECG characteristics (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-ventricular-arrhythmias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: Ventricular arrhythmias&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>QRS duration of more than 120 msec</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bizarre morphology that does not resemble usual aberration (ie, a typical right or left bundle branch block)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T wave in the opposite direction from the main QRS vector</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A fully compensatory pause (ie, the PP interval surrounding the VPB is twice the sinus PP interval); less frequently, the VPB is interpolated and does not alter the baseline sinus interval (ie, the PP interval surrounding the VPB is equal to the sinus PP interval)</p><p/><p>The pause results from retrograde block in the atrioventricular (AV) node and hence an inability of the ventricular impulse to penetrate the atrium and affect the sinus node. The sinus node fires on time, but the impulse it generates is unable to conduct to the ventricle since the AV node is blocking, having been rendered refractory by the VPB and the retrograde AV node penetration; hence a compensatory delay occurs (ie, the RR interval surrounding the VPB is twice the sinus RR interval).</p><p>There are notable exceptions to these characteristic findings, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A less wide QRS complex that results from a VPB originating from the contralateral ventricle in a patient with a preexisting bundle branch block.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pseudonormalized T wave in a patient with a prior myocardial infarction.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A VPB that resets the sinus node and creates a noncompensatory pause.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An interpolated VPB that is unable to conduct retrogradely through the AV node and does not affect the underlying atrial or ventricular rate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72768\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef72768 \">waveform 2</a>). However, the PR interval following the interpolated VPB is often longer than the baseline PR interval due to retrograde concealed conduction (ie, the ventricular impulse penetrates the AV node retrograde), but it does not completely depolarize the node. Thus, a subsequent atrial impulse may get through the AV node but with a slower rate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-ventricular-arrhythmias#H1\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: Ventricular arrhythmias&quot;, section on 'Premature ventricular contractions'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Classically, unifocal VPBs have fixed coupling intervals with the preceding beat since the most frequent mechanism is localized reentry. By comparison, unifocal VPBs with variable coupling suggests a parasystolic focus due to ectopic tissue that exhibits autonomy. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Parasystole'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Parasystole</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ventricular parasystole represents an independent ectopic ventricular rhythm that competes with the sinus rhythm. It appears on the ECG as unifocal VPBs with a variable coupling cycle (the interval between the prior sinus beat and the premature beat varies) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70928\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef70928 \">waveform 3</a>). There is entrance block into this focus, and thus it continues to fire at its own rate. There is also exit block from this focus (ie, it will result in ventricular depolarization and a ventricular complex only when the ventricular myocardium is capable of being stimulated). Parasystole may be caused by an automatic or triggered mechanism, may be modulated by other coincident cardiac rhythms, or may be irregularly manifest because of exit block. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-ventricular-arrhythmias#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: Ventricular arrhythmias&quot;, section on 'Ventricular parasystole'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Multifocal VPBs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multifocal VPBs may originate from various sites, from one site with multiple exit points into the ventricular myocardium, or from changes in the pattern or direction of myocardial activation due to variables in ventricular electrophysiologic properties.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">R-on-T phenomenon</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &quot;R-on-T phenomenon&quot; is largely only of historic interest and has little prognostic importance in most clinical situations. VPBs that begin at or near the apex of the T wave (termed the vulnerable period, which is a time when the energy threshold for ventricular fibrillation is reduced) are said to illustrate the &quot;R-on-T&quot; phenomenon. Although VPBs exhibiting the R-on-T phenomenon were originally felt to carry a grave prognosis (being associated with ventricular fibrillation), subsequent studies found that late coupled VPBs were equally as likely as R-on-T VPBs to initiate repetitive ventricular arrhythmia (particularly ventricular tachycardia) in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-premature-beats/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. In addition, the lack of significance of the R-on-T phenomenon is well illustrated during invasive electrophysiology studies during which programmed ventricular stimulation is routinely carried out, applying VPBs at the vulnerable period of the cardiac cycle, without producing malignant ventricular arrhythmias in normal hearts.</p><p>The R-on-T VPB may be of importance, however, in subsets of patients at risk for polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, such as those with acute myocardial ischemia, the Brugada syndrome, the malignant form of early repolarization, and idiopathic ventricular fibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-premature-beats/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>].

One pattern, ventricular bigeminy, refers to a persistent alternation of normal and premature beats (ie, every other QRS complex is a VPB) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F51529\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef51529 \">waveform 4</a>). Ventricular trigeminy (two normal beats followed by a VPB) and quadrigeminy (three normal beats followed by a VPB) have also been described (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64181\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef64181 \">waveform 5</a>). They rarely cause severe symptoms and have <strong>no known</strong> independent prognostic importance. They represent only a repeating pattern of VPBs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3566083\"><span class=\"h2\">Ambulatory monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In evaluating patients with suspected VPBs, 24 to 48 hours of ambulatory ECG monitoring significantly increases the likelihood of making the diagnosis, given the sporadic nature of VPBs in most patients. In addition, diurnal variability commonly results in an increased morning frequency of VPBs, and the number of VPBs on an ambulatory ECG recording may reveal great hourly and daily fluctuations on serial studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-premature-beats/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Twenty-four-hour Holter monitoring is also the best accepted approach to quantifying the frequency of PVCs as a percentage of total heart beats.

As an example, data from the Beta Blocker Heart Attack Trial (BHAT) found an increase in ectopy during the period of recovery from the acute infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-premature-beats/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].

Thus, the utility of exercise testing is not limited to only detecting ischemia, but it also provides some additional information related to the behavior of ventricular ectopy during exertion. Catecholamine- or exercise-induced VPBs respond well to beta blocker therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=catecholaminergic-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-and-other-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardias-with-a-normal-qt-interval#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and other polymorphic ventricular tachycardias with a normal QT interval&quot;, section on 'Beta blockers'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">EP testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although electrophysiologic (EP) testing is rarely indicated as part of the diagnostic evaluation for patients with VPBs, this arrhythmia does occur during studies being performed for other reasons. At EP study, the evaluation of a wide complex beat is based upon the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An aberrantly conducted supraventricular beat is excluded if a short or negative HV interval is present.

If the atrium and ventricle are dissociated or if atrial activation follows ventricular activation, then ventricular pre-excitation is excluded, and the beat is ventricular in origin.</p><p/><p>EP testing is also a standard component of a catheter ablation procedure, which is increasingly used for treatment of patients with frequent symptomatic PVCs. (See <a href=\"#H591110\" class=\"local\">'Antiarrhythmic medications and radiofrequency catheter ablation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15572590\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In persons found to have frequent VPBs, further evaluation and management is based on the presence or absence of underlying structural heart disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptoms. The presence of frequent VPBs should precipitate a diagnostic evaluation for the possible presence of underlying structural heart disease, which has prognostic significance and may require specific therapy. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p>Patients found to have underlying structural heart disease will typically receive medical therapy specific to their disease process. In many cases, this therapy will also reduce the frequency of VPBs. Examples of therapy which can reduce the frequency of VPBs are beta blockers, which improve survival in patients with a prior myocardial infarction or heart failure, and antihypertensive therapy, which may induce regression of LVH in patients with hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-premature-beats/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-myocardial-infarction-role-of-beta-blocker-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute myocardial infarction: Role of beta blocker therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-beta-blockers-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of beta blockers in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The second issue relates to whether the patient has symptoms attributable to the VPBs. There is no clear evidence that VPB suppression with beta blockers or antiarrhythmic drugs improves overall survival in patients who have no symptoms and have not had a major arrhythmic event. Thus, the only indications for the use of beta blockers or antiarrhythmic drugs for VPB suppression are for symptomatic patients or for patients with cardiomyopathy felt to be possibly related to frequent VPBs. Before embarking on drug therapy, however, abstinence should first be advised to an individual with exposure to known stimulants, although this strategy has not been a consistently effective intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-premature-beats/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. If VPBs and symptoms persist following abstinence, in the case of absent underlying structural heart disease, offering reassurance to the individual regarding the benign nature of ventricular ectopy may suffice; if not, the next step may be treatment with a beta-blocker <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a calcium channel blocker. The use of membrane active antiarrhythmic therapy and catheter ablation is reserved for patients who do not respond to treatment with beta blockers or calcium channel blockers, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> are intolerant or prefer not to take these medications. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15572596\"><span class=\"h2\">Beta blockers and calcium channel blockers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While there is no clear mortality benefit from VPB suppression in asymptomatic patients, some patients with significant symptoms from their VPBs will require medical therapy or ablation in an effort to reduce or eliminate symptoms. We suggest using a beta blocker or, less commonly, a calcium channel blocker as the first-line drug for treatment of symptomatic VPBs. While beta blockers have no direct effects on the ventricular myocardium and therefore are not likely to suppress VPBs (unless they are due to excess sympathetic stimulation or increased catecholamines), they may reduce symptoms. This is due to the fact that beta blockers reduce the post-extrasystolic potentiation via the Starling mechanism (increased inotropy related to the increased stroke volume) associated with the VPB. </p><p>If beta blockers <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> calcium channel blockers are ineffective, antiarrhythmic drugs can be used, often with good results. However, many antiarrhythmic drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flecainide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flecainide</a> and other class Ic antiarrhythmic drugs) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56600\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56600 \">table 1</a>) are associated with increased mortality due to proarrhythmia when given to patients with a prior myocardial infarction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F59975\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59975 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F71934\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71934 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-premature-beats/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. Proarrhythmia with these drugs is less of a concern in patients without organic heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-premature-beats/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

The lowest dose of beta blockers that relieves symptoms should be used in order to minimize side effects, with the exception of patients with a prior MI or heart failure in whom the dose is titrated to that recommended for treatment of the underlying disease.

For most patients, either approach is a reasonable first choice. However, for patients with frequent VPBs associated with left ventricular dysfunction, we suggest radiofrequency ablation. In addition, for patients with symptomatic VPBs that are refractory to medical therapy with beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and antiarrhythmic medications, radiofrequency ablation should be considered.</p><p>The decision to recommend antiarrhythmic medication or radiofrequency catheter ablation in a particular patient will depend on many clinical factors and also patient preference. Clinical variables that identify a patient most likely to respond to catheter ablation include unifocal PVCs, frequency PVCs (ie, &gt;10,000 per 24 hours), and a left bundle branch block inferior axis morphology. Although unifocal PVCs with a right bundle branch block morphology also respond to catheter ablation, this typically will require ablation in the LV <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> aortic root, which is slightly more complicated. </p><p>In the small group of patients with drug refractory VPBs who are very symptomatic, radiofrequency catheter ablation may be an effective treatment. In one study of 12 patients who did not have spontaneous or inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), radiofrequency catheter ablation of an isolated focus was successful in 11 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-premature-beats/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. During a 25-month follow-up, two patients had recurrent symptoms that were controlled with a previously ineffective drug. In a 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis of radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of idiopathic VPBs originating from the right ventricular outflow tract, catheter ablation was associated with a significant reduction in VPB burden along with a significant improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction, though the meta-analysis was limited by significant heterogeneity among the studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-premature-beats/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>The antiarrhythmic drug of choice is variable and depends on the presence or absence of underlying structural heart disease, particularly coronary heart disease (CHD). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flecainide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Flecainide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propafenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propafenone</a>, class Ic antiarrhythmic drugs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56600\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56600 \">table 1</a>), are highly effective at suppressing VPBs. However, both are contraindicated in patients with preexisting CHD due to the potential for proarrhythmia and increased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-premature-beats/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].</p><p>In patients who cannot take class Ic drugs, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a> are effective alternative agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-premature-beats/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Trials of amiodarone use in patients with VPBs and a prior myocardial infarction or heart failure have demonstrated a significant reduction in VPBs and in arrhythmic mortality, but routine amiodarone therapy in asymptomatic patients is not recommended because of the absence of a significant improvement in overall mortality and potential for side effects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67684\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67684 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-premature-beats/abstract/44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-46</a>].

It is important to recognize that idiopathic VPBs arising in the right ventricle outflow tract (RVOT) are common, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is very rare. ARVC should generally be suspected in patients with a family history of sudden death <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> T wave inversion in the right precordial leads.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prevalence of VPBs is directly related to the study population, the detection method, and the duration of observation. When 24-hour ambulatory monitoring is used, up to 80 percent of apparently healthy people have VPBs, with an age-related increase in the prevalence. VPBs have also been frequently reported in association with numerous underlying cardiac pathologies. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mechanisms by which VPBs are generated include reentry, enhanced or abnormal automaticity, and triggered activity resulting in afterdepolarizations. Reentry is the most common mechanism for VPBs. The most frequent site of origin of benign VPBs (in individuals with a normal heart) is the right ventricular outflow tract with the characteristic morphology of left bundle branch block and an inferior axis. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms for VPBs'</a> above and <a href=\"#H856328773\" class=\"local\">'Outflow tract VPBs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VPBs produce few or no symptoms in the vast majority of patients. When present, the most common symptoms resulting from VPBs are palpitations secondary to the hypercontractility of a post-VPB beat or a feeling that the heart has stopped secondary to a post-VPB pause. Less often, frequent VPBs can result in a pounding sensation in the neck, lightheadedness, or near syncope. Only rarely do VPBs cause true hemodynamic compromise except in patients with very frequent ectopy and severely depressed left ventricular function or when VPBs are concurrent with underlying bradycardia. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients in whom VPBs are suspected but not yet documented, an ECG should be performed, preferably while symptomatic if symptoms are present. Due to the brief nature of the test, VPBs may not be recorded during a standard ECG. In such cases, ambulatory monitoring should be performed, initially for 24 or 48 hours or, if necessary, for up to 30 days, which will significantly increase the likelihood of detecting VPBs. (See <a href=\"#H3566020\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients in whom otherwise unexplained VPBs have been identified, the following evaluation should be performed (see <a href=\"#H3566020\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Twenty-four-hour ambulatory (Holter) monitor to quantify the frequency of VPBs and determine if they are monomorphic or multimorphic.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Echocardiography to assess cardiac structure and function.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Exercise treadmill stress test to evaluate the response of the VPBs to exercise, determine the VPB morphology, determine if sustained or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) can be induced with exercise, as well as to screen for underlying ischemia. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In persons found to have frequent VPBs or more importantly repetitive forms of VPBs (couplets or nonsustained VT), further evaluation and management is based on the presence or absence of underlying structural heart disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptoms. The presence of frequent VPBs should lead to a clinical assessment for the possible presence of underlying structural heart disease, which has prognostic significance and may require specific therapy. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment approach to patients with VPBs depends on the presence or absence of symptoms as well as the presence or absence of underlying structural heart disease:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Since there is no clear evidence that VPB suppression with antiarrhythmic drugs improves overall survival, antiarrhythmic drugs should not be used in patients who have no VPB-related symptoms and have not had a major arrhythmic event. (See <a href=\"#H15572590\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Initial treatment for patients with symptomatic VPBs should focus on abstaining from known stimulants or triggers of VPBs.

For most patients, either approach is a reasonable first choice. The decision to recommend antiarrhythmic medication or radiofrequency catheter ablation in a particular patient will depend on many clinical factors and also patient preference. (See <a href=\"#H591110\" class=\"local\">'Antiarrhythmic medications and radiofrequency catheter ablation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>The antiarrhythmic drug of choice is variable and depends on the presence or absence of underlying structural heart disease, particularly coronary heart disease (CHD). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flecainide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Flecainide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propafenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propafenone</a>, class Ic antiarrhythmic drugs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56600\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56600 \">table 1</a>) are highly effective at suppressing VPBs.
