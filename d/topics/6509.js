Estrogen-associated migraine refers to migraine headaches that occur when there is a sufficient decline in estrogen concentration after exposure to high levels of the hormone for several days (estrogen priming), as in the following settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Natural declines in endogenous estrogen, such as at the beginning of the menstrual cycle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72415\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72415 \">figure 1</a>) or postpartum.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Scheduled withdrawal from exogenous estrogen-containing products, such as during the hormone-free interval in users of cyclic estrogen-progestin contraceptives (pills, transdermal patch, ring) or with interruptions in estrogen therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unintentional estrogen withdrawal, such as from missed doses of estrogen-containing products or as a result of drug interactions that reduce bioavailability.</p><p/><p>Estrogen-associated migraine, primarily menstrual migraine, will be reviewed here. The pathophysiology, clinical manifestations and diagnosis of migraine and treatment of nonestrogen-withdrawal migraine are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of migraine in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-treatment-of-migraine-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute treatment of migraine in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Headaches (including migraine) in pregnant &#160; &#160; women and use of estrogen-containing contraceptives in women with preexisting migraine headache are also discussed elsewhere.

The predominant effects are facilitation of the serotonergic and glutamatergic systems. Serotonergic tone in women is positively correlated with estrogen levels. When estrogen concentrations decline, serotonin concentrations also fall due to a decline in production coupled with an increased rate of elimination. The resultant decline in serotonergic function is associated with release of calcitonin gene-related peptide and substance P from trigeminal nerves, and may lead to vasodilation of cranial vessels and sensitization of meningeal afferents of the trigeminal nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Estrogen may also affect other chemical mediators, such as nitric oxide, magnesium, or prostaglandins, which may also modulate the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>].</p><p>Additionally, it is important to remember that nonmigraine pain is also perceived as more intense perimenstrually, possibly reflecting changes in cranial nociception, as well as a decrease in endogenous opioid activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to puberty, migraine occurs in 2.5 to 4 percent of children, with a slightly higher prevalence among boys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The prevalence changes with the onset of puberty, at which time migraine becomes markedly more prevalent in females than males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This change has been attributed to hormonal fluctuations associated with pubertal maturation that precede the characteristic hormonal pattern observed in ovulatory women. This theory is supported by a study in which 25 percent of 9 to 12 year old girls referred to a pediatric headache center reported a monthly pattern to their headaches, even though only 13 percent had reached menarche [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Migraine is also very common in the perimenopausal period, which, like menarche, is characterized by marked fluctuations in estrogen levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Peak migraine prevalence in women occurs during the early 40s, and some studies suggest as many as 41 percent of all women will have experienced a migraine episode by age 50 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>After menopause, the prevalence of migraine falls by about one-half, at least partly as a result of hormonal stability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/10,14,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14,16,17</a>]. It has been the author's observation that women who enter menopause with isolated menstrual migraine tend to improve, whereas those with menstrual migraine complicated by chronic daily headaches initially worsen. Worsening in this subgroup may be due, in part, to the impact of menopausal sleep disruptions on the headache disorder. Whether there is an association between menopausal symptoms and increased risk of migraine is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>].</p><p>Women who undergo surgical menopause are thought to be more likely to experience worsening of their migraines than women who have natural menopause. Although observational data support this hypothesis, some data are conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/14,16,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16,21,22</a>]. Patient selection may account for why some studies have found worsening migraine after surgical menopause. For example, one study only included women under treatment in headache clinics who underwent surgical menopause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], and another included women with functioning ovaries in their surgical menopause group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Women with endometriosis have a greater likelihood of chronic migraine (as opposed to episodic estrogen-withdrawal headache) and migraine disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In my experience, these women are also prone to undergoing surgical menopause with the hope that it will relieve their chronic migraines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MENSTRUAL MIGRAINE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>&quot;Pure menstrual migraine&quot; refers to migraine headaches that occur exclusively in close temporal relationship to menses, within a window spanning two days before onset through the third day of menstrual bleeding (day -2 to +3 of the menstrual cycle) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. At least two-thirds of menstrual cycles in affected women should be associated with migraine. For many women, &quot;pure menstrual migraine&quot; may represent just a window in time before their migraines became more frequent, but the menstrual trigger usually remains the worst migraine. &quot;Menstrually related migraine&quot; describes the migraine associated with the menses in a woman who now experiences migraine at other times as well.</p><p>In this topic, the two types of menstrual migraine will be considered together. Compared with non-menstrual attacks, menstrual migraines tend to be more severe, last longer, and are less responsive to acute treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>]. Neither type is commonly associated with aura, although affected individuals may experience aura with non-menstrual attacks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Migraine may be the most common disabling condition in reproductive-age women, and menstruation may be the most potent and common of all migraine triggers. Up to 70 percent of female migraineurs report menstrual association. Pure menstrual migraine is less common than menstrually related migraine (7 to 21 percent of female migraineurs versus 35 to 56 percent of female migraineurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/6,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical manifestations of menstrual migraine are similar to those seen with nonestrogen-associated migraine; however, menstrual migraine is less commonly associated with aura [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. This is felt to be due to the very low estrogen environment associated with menses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults#H21674085\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of migraine in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial treatment of menstrual migraine should be the same as for migraine occurring at other times: a rapid-onset triptan administered early in the mild pain stage.</p><p>If treatment of acute attacks is inadequate or unsatisfactory, then prevention is indicated. Factors to consider include medical comorbidities, side effects of individual agents, cost, and individual patient preferences. We suggest specific (hormonal) prevention with one of the following regimens: extended-cycle estrogen-progestin contraception, cyclic estrogen-progestin contraception with supplemental estrogen in place of placebo pills, or natural cycles with targeted supplemental estrogen during menses. If contraindications to estrogen therapy exist, then nonhormonal strategies should be employed. Our preference is a long-acting triptan taken twice daily. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-treatment-of-migraine-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute treatment of migraine in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The following discussion describes the evidence supporting these recommendations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Abortive treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial abortive therapy of acute menstrual migraine is the same as for migraine occurring at any other time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4440588\"><span class=\"h3\">Triptans</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The serotonin <span class=\"nowrap\">1b/1d</span> agonists (triptans) are considered to be specific therapies for acute migraine because, in contrast to analgesics, they address the pathophysiologic mechanism of the headache. All triptans inhibit the release of vasoactive peptides, promote vasoconstriction, and block pain pathways in the brainstem. Triptans inhibit transmission in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis, thereby blocking afferent input to second order neurons. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of migraine in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An advantage of triptans is that they have beneficial effects upon other phenomena of migraine, particularly nausea and photophobia. All of the triptans have been studied in randomized trials of the acute treatment of menstrual migraine; all were found superior to placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4440595\"><span class=\"h3\">NSAIDs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) alone may be effective in some women.

Prevention includes lifestyle modifications (with or without pharmaceutical therapies) that are aimed at decreasing attack frequency, duration, accompanying symptoms, and disability. These healthy lifestyle modifications include addressing non-restorative sleep with healthy sleep habits and avoiding skipped meals. Preventive therapies for menstrual migraine can be either nonspecific (those that do not address the hormonal trigger) or specific (hormone-based treatments). With nonspecific strategies, success requires accurate anticipation of menses for scheduling interventions; therefore, women with irregular cycles are not good candidates for these options. Comorbidities (eg, dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, endometriosis) and contraception needs may influence choice of preventive therapy or argue for their earlier initiation.</p><p>Menstrual migraine appears to be a significant contributor to both chronic daily headache and medication overuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Thus, preventive treatment has multiple benefits.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">NSAIDs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The only controlled trial of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for prevention of menstrual migraine found that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> significantly reduced a composite pain index including frequency, severity, and duration of attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Naproxen was given to 40 patients for three cycles at a dose of 550 mg twice daily beginning seven days before onset of menses and continued for 13 days. There is strong evidence that NSAIDs reduce dysmenorrhea, which is a common comorbid condition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary dysmenorrhea in adult women&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The modest benefit realized with this strategy should be balanced against the risk of potentially serious adverse events (gastrointestinal, cardiovascular) associated with use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> and other NSAIDs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonselective-nsaids-overview-of-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonselective NSAIDs: Overview of adverse effects&quot;</a>.) The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that patients should neither exceed the recommended doses for naproxen sodium (220 milligrams twice daily) nor take naproxen for longer than 10 days unless a physician directs otherwise.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Triptans</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Scheduled dosing of triptans is effective for prevention of menstrual migraine; the most studied drug is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=frovatriptan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">frovatriptan</a> 2.5 mg once or twice daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The efficacy of scheduled dosing of triptans for prevention of menstrual migraine is based on data from four randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/41-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-44</a>]. In each of these trials, success was dependent upon the subject having regular menses and predictable timing of menstrual migraine. Scheduled doses were begun two days before the anticipated onset of menses and continued for five to six days.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized trial assigned 546 women with menstrually associated migraine to placebo, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=frovatriptan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">frovatriptan</a> 2.5 mg daily, or frovatriptan 2.5 mg twice per day beginning two days before the anticipated onset of menstrual migraine and continuing for six days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The incidence of menstrual migraine during three six-day perimenstrual periods was 67 percent for placebo, 52 percent for frovatriptan 2.5 mg daily, and 41 percent for frovatriptan 2.5 mg twice daily. Both frovatriptan regimens were significantly superior to placebo and the twice daily regimen was superior to the daily regimen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Another placebo-controlled randomized trial assigned 427 women with difficult to treat menstrual migraine to placebo, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=frovatriptan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">frovatriptan</a> 2.5 mg daily, or frovatriptan 2.5 mg twice per day for three menstrual cycles beginning two days before the anticipated onset of menstrual migraine and continuing for six days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The mean number of headache-free perimenstrual periods was 0.92 with frovatriptan 2.5 mg twice per day, 0.69 with frovatriptan 2.5 mg daily, and 0.42 with placebo. When migraine occurred, severity was reduced with both frovatriptan doses compared with placebo.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial including 206 women reported <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naratriptan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naratriptan</a> (1 mg twice daily beginning two days before anticipated menses and continued for five days) was effective for intermittent prophylaxis of menstrually associated migraine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Patients treated with naratriptan experienced twice as many headache-free perimenstrual periods than those on placebo (50 versus 25 percent).

Thus, the goal of hormone-based prophylaxis for women with menstrual migraines is to eliminate or sufficiently minimize the premenstrual decline in estrogen that precipitates these migraines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. A study of 229 women who were prescribed specific hormonal therapies for prevention of menstrual migraine reported these strategies led to resolution of menstrually related migraine in 81 percent of subjects who were compliant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In addition, in a case-control study from a nationwide health care claims database, women with migraine without aura had a similar risk of ischemic stroke whether or not they were using combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) (both groups had an approximately twofold increased risk of ischemic stroke, although the risk was slightly lower for CHC users) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Clearly identifying the type of migraine is critical because most women with migraine have menstrual-related migraine, but do not have migraine with aura [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Hormonal prophylaxis can be an effective option for women who need contraception, for those whose menstrual migraine does not respond to nonspecific approaches, and for those with the common comorbidities that warrant its use, such as endometriosis, menorrhagia, and dysmenorrhea. In 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated their <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/rr/pdfs/rr6503.pdf&amp;token=R4Uiw8/bmPVaqNHRDqpXLDUG08ZbGAJiu0qbyu/2zoLeJvpavTmTqGQFKmDZkc63Jfzd7KsO+nuCaCdkRxN0Wg==&amp;TOPIC_ID=5441\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use</a> and removed restrictions for the use of CHCs in migraine without aura, including menstrual migraine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Thus, we offer CHCs to women with menstrual migraine who have no other contraindications to CHC use.</p><p>We also discuss low dose (ie, &le; 30 mcg ethinyl estradiol) CHC use in women with migraine with aura who are otherwise appropriate candidates for CHC treatment. We believe recommendations to avoid CHCs in all women with migraine with aura should be reassessed in light of newer data from studies evaluating today's low dose CHC formulations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/49-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-52</a>]. The concern for CHC use in women with migraine with aura comes from studies reporting that migraine with aura is associated with up to a twofold increased risk of ischemic stroke, independent of other variables (although the absolute risk remains quite low in healthy, nonsmoking women) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/48,53-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,53-55</a>]. Similarly, CHCs have also been associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke and this association also appears to vary with the estrogen dose. In the landmark 1975 study that reported an increased risk of stroke with CHC use, the pill formulations contained 100 mcg mestranol and 50 mcg ethinyl estradiol in constant dosing regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Of note, the highest dose available in the United States today is 50 mcg and accounts for less than 1 percent of contraceptives currently sold. Today's interpretation of the landmark study is that high-dose oral contraceptives confer a relative risk of 4.4 for ischemic stroke, a risk that presence of migraine did not significantly alter. Subsequent studies have consistently reported that stroke risk is not increased with very low-dose combined hormonal contraceptives (ie, 20 to 25 mcg ethinyl estradiol), and continuous ultra-low-dose formulations (10 to 15 mcg ethinyl estradiol) may even reduce aura frequency, and thereby potentially decrease stroke risk, although data are not yet available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/57-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-59</a>]. </p><p>Of note, in adolescents with menstrual migraine who do not require contraception, it is preferable to delay use of estrogen-progestin contraceptives until linear growth ceases, usually about two years after menarche. However, treatment benefits should be balanced with consequences of under treatment of menstrual migraine, including missed school or work days, impaired performance, and possible progression to chronic daily headache. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contraception-issues-specific-to-adolescents#H707998035\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contraception: Issues specific to adolescents&quot;, section on 'Choosing a method'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22137996\"><span class=\"h4\">Extended-cycle estrogen-progestin contraceptives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traditional combined hormonal contraceptives used cyclically (ie, 21 to 24 active days and 4 to 7 non-hormone days) are unlikely to be beneficial in women who experience menstrual migraine in natural cycles. This is because the decline in estrogen during the four- to seven-day hormone-free interval is equivalent to the decline experienced in a natural cycle (ie, in a natural menstrual cycle, the late luteal phase decline in estradiol concentration is equivalent to that with cessation of use of a contraceptive pill containing 20 to 25 mcg ethinyl estradiol). A newer cyclic contraceptive with 26 days of 10 mcg ethinyl estradiol and only two placebo pills will work, however. The drop in estrogen in this regimen is only 10 mcg, minimizing the drop in estrogen to a level that has been shown not to trigger menstrual migraine in most women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>Extended-cycle strategies involve continuous administration of an estrogen-progestin for an extended period of time and thus avoid a monthly abrupt decline in estrogen concentration. Several types of oral estrogen-progestin contraceptive pills are available for extended use and allow the woman to eliminate the hormone-free interval indefinitely. An open label uncontrolled study found that extended cycle dosing of an oral contraceptive was associated with improvement in mood scores, headache scores and pelvic pain compared to traditional <span class=\"nowrap\">21/7</span> cycle dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Improvements persisted throughout the year of follow-up on extended-cycle dosing of an oral contraceptive containing drospirenone combined with 30 &mu;g ethinyl estradiol. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hormonal-contraception-for-suppression-of-menstruation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hormonal contraception for suppression of menstruation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Non-oral estrogen-progestin contraceptives (ring, patch) have also been used off-label in extended cycles. With prolonged suppression of ovulation, both menses and menstrual migraine can be avoided for months at a time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. The most common side effect of extended cycle regimens is breakthrough bleeding, but this tends to decrease over time. When the ring contraceptive is used in extended cycles for prevention of migraine, it is important that the ring be changed every three weeks; if changed every four weeks, the resulting decline in estrogen concentration is often sufficient to induce estrogen-withdrawal migraine.</p><p>When using extended-cycle regimens that allow for periodic menses, we suggest estrogen supplementation in the otherwise hormone-free week (see below). If the decline in ethinyl estradiol dose is limited to 10 mcg, menstrual migraine can be prevented. LoSeasonique&trade; is a commercially available oral contraceptive that accomplishes this. It contains ethinyl estradiol 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a></span> for 12 weeks, followed by 10 mcg of ethinyl estradiol alone in week 13.</p><p>If the patient is taking a 30 mcg extended cycle product, the addition of a daily dose of 20 mcg ethinyl estradiol during the scheduled non-hormone week may be beneficial in preventing menstrual migraine. This ethinyl estradiol dose can be approximated with conjugated equine estrogen 0.9 mg twice daily.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22138003\"><span class=\"h4\">Cyclic estrogen-progestin contraception with supplemental estrogen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As discussed above, the late luteal phase decline in estradiol concentration in a natural menstrual cycle is equivalent to the decline in estrogen with cessation of use of a pill containing 20 to 25 mcg ethinyl estradiol. Therefore, cyclic use of estrogen-progestin pills containing &ge;20 to 25 mcg ethinyl estradiol does not prevent menstrual migraine, and higher dose oral contraceptives containing 30 to 50 mcg ethinyl estradiol would be expected to worsen menstrual migraine. For women who experience menstrual migraine, but want to use conventional estrogen-progestin contraception, the addition of supplemental estrogen during the hormone-free interval can prevent estrogen withdrawal migraine. As an example, a small open-label study administered a 20 mcg ethinyl estradiol oral contraceptive at bedtime on days 1 to 21, with 0.9 mg conjugated estrogens dosed at bedtime on days 22 to 28 (in lieu of the seven hormone-free pills in the pill pack) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. All of the patients had at least a 50 percent reduction in number of headache days per month, with a mean reduction of 78 percent.</p><p>For women using a contraceptive patch, we suggest use of transdermal ethinyl estradiol 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/24</span> hours once weekly during the hormone-free week in women using the 20 mcg ethinyl <span class=\"nowrap\">estradiol/norelgestromin</span> contraceptive patch and transdermal ethinyl estradiol 0.075 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/24</span> hours once weekly for those using the 15 mcg ethinyl <span class=\"nowrap\">estradiol/etonogestrel</span> contraceptive patch. We have found these doses are usually adequate to prevent menstrual migraine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H336262563\"><span class=\"h4\">Combined hormonal contraceptives that limit the decline in estrogen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another method for avoiding menstrual migraines is to sequentially reduce the estrogen dose to limit the premenstrual decline in estrogen that precipitates menstrual migraine. One treatment option is the use of quadriphasic contraceptive pills that contain estrogens in declining doses along with a simultaneous increase in the progestin. As an example, in a prospective study of 32 women treated with a quadriphasic contraceptive containing declining doses of estradiol valerate (E2V) and increasing doses of the progestin <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dienogest-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dienogest</a>, women reported fewer migraines, shorter duration of headache, lessened severity of pain, and reduced analgesic use compared with their baseline scores recorded prior to hormone initiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Another option is a sequential-dose contraceptive pill containing 10 mcg of EE and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norethindrone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norethindrone</a> acetate. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22138010\"><span class=\"h4\">Menstrually-targeted estrogen supplements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who have contraindications to the use of estrogen-containing contraceptives may still be candidates for targeted strategies using low dose estrogen, such as perimenstrual transdermal administration of estradiol via a patch or gel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/33,64-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,64-67</a>]. In one study, an estrogen patch was applied just before the onset of bleeding and left in place for seven days, thus limiting the magnitude of the premenstrual decline in estrogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. The 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/24</span> hours patch was effective; however, lower doses of estradiol (0.025 mg or 0.05 mg per 24 hours) did not prevent menstrual migraine. A randomized trial also found lower doses of transdermal estradiol (0.05 mg) are not effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>], while three studies reported estradiol gel 1.5 mg daily is effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/65-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">65-67</a>].</p><p>If estrogen supplementation is begun too early (starting six days before the first full day of menstruation and continued through day 2 of menses), there appears to be an increased risk of migraine just after the estrogen supplement is stopped [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22138017\"><span class=\"h4\">Selective estrogen receptor modulators&nbsp;(SERMs)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In one small open-label study, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> (10 to 20 mg per day for 7 to 14 days before menses and 5 to 10 mg for three days during menses) led to improvement in seven of eight women with severe migraine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raloxifene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Raloxifene</a> has not been studied in menstrual migraine.

However, there is no evidence of any benefit of progestin-based therapies, including progestin-releasing intrauterine devices, on menstrual migraine or hormonally mediated headaches.

Symptoms often begin four to seven years before menopause. During this transition, migraines typically worsen as menstrual cycles become erratic and closer together and sleep becomes disrupted.</p><p>With menopause and the complete cessation of monthly cycling of estrogen, migraines usually improve. It is the author's clinical observation from decades of experience in both menopause clinics and headache clinics that, if women enter menopause with episodic migraine, their headaches markedly improve. If they enter menopause with chronic migraine, they typically worsen, as the sleep and mood disruptions of menopause are superimposed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">EXOGENOUS HORMONE-INDUCED HEADACHE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exogenous hormone-induced headache refers to headaches that occur as adverse events during regular intake of exogenous hormones, either for contraception or as hormone therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].

Although current users of hormone therapy were more likely to have reported a migraine in the past year (adjusted odds ratio 1.42; 95% CI 1.24-1.62), it was not clear whether hormone therapy increased the risk of migraine or whether women with migraine were more likely to use hormone therapy, perhaps as treatment.

Cyclic hormone regimens, such as those in which estrogen is administered for only 25 days a month, are uncommonly used today and should be avoided in migraineurs to avoid an estrogen-withdrawal trigger. Data from a randomized trial showed that patients treated with a continuous combined estrogen-progestin regimen had fewer days with headache than those treated with cyclic or continuous sequential regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. Continuous therapy also increases the probability of induction of amenorrhea, which occurs in approximately 75 percent of women versus 10 to 20 percent with cyclic therapy.

If an oral agent is used, we suggest bedtime dosing so that trough estrogen levels do not occur during the early morning hours, which is the peak time of migraine occurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estrogen-associated-migraine/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>].</p><p>Progestogens include both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a> and synthetic progestins.
