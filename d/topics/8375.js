It is caused by a trinucleotide (cytosine-adenine-guanine [CAG]) expansion in the Huntington gene on chromosome 4p and inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. As there is no known cure, treatment is symptomatic and remains supportive.</p><p>This topic will review the management of HD. Other aspects of HD are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Huntington disease: Genetics and pathogenesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Huntington disease: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SUPPORTIVE CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No cure or disease-modifying treatment is currently available for HD. Therapy is focused on symptom management and supportive care in order to optimize quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Despite these difficult circumstances, practitioners must be vigilant in caring for patients with HD and their families.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3298617407\"><span class=\"h2\">Multidisciplinary care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best care for patients with HD is provided by a multidisciplinary team of health professionals and supportive caregivers that addresses the broad physical and psychological needs of patients and families, and manages new issues as they arise through long-term follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Ideally, the health care team includes a variety of professionals and covers various areas of expertise that may be needed over time to support the patient with HD, including neurology, psychiatry, genetics, social work, and nutrition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F115528\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115528 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-management/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Use of physical therapy, occupational therapy, and home care may allow for prolongation of community living, although there is a dearth of supporting literature.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2781517475\"><span class=\"h2\">Palliative care and advance care planning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Palliative care focuses on preventing and relieving suffering and on supporting the best possible quality of life for patients and their families facing serious illness. Although HD is a chronic disease with a relatively slow course, the principles of palliative care are appropriate throughout the disease progression.</p><p>Advance care planning is an ongoing process in which patients, their families, and their healthcare providers reflect on the patient's goals, values, and beliefs, discuss how they should inform current and future medical care, and use this information to accurately document the patient's future health care choices. This should take place while the person is able to do so (ie, while they can communicate clearly and have full capacity). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advance-care-planning-and-advance-directives\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advance care planning and advance directives&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Advance care planning allows the patient to express views on the goals of care, future treatments (eg, intensive care unit interventions, resuscitation status, potential use of a gastric tube feeding), the place of care, the place of death (eg, home, hospice, or hospital), their legal will, and funeral plans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-management/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. These wishes can be incorporated into an advance directive to guide healthcare decision-making when capacity is lost.</p><p>As part of the process, clinicians should inform patients about their estimated prognosis, realizing that there is a large element of individual variability in the natural history of HD. Clinicians should also advise patients about treatment options and help them make treatment decisions while incorporating patient preferences and values (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F94515\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94515 \">table 2</a>). The best time to initiate advance care planning for patients with HD is uncertain, particularly for individuals who receive a diagnosis of HD through predictive genetic testing years before symptom onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, the discussion should be initiated by the physician, generally no later than when patients begin to show symptoms and signs of disease progression, and revisited periodically until clear directives are in place.

These are addressed in the sections below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Chorea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The impact of chorea in patients with HD should be carefully assessed to determine whether any specific treatment is necessary, since it may not be a debilitating or bothersome symptom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Treatment is indicated if chorea is prominent and interferes with function, particularly for patients with severe chorea, which may result in pain, injury, falls, poor sleep, and weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Such patients may benefit from pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions. However, pharmacologic treatment of chorea may worsen other aspects of HD, including parkinsonism, cognition, and depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Suicidality is an additional risk associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetrabenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetrabenazine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deutetrabenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">deutetrabenazine</a>.</p><p>The movement disorder of HD typically changes over time as the disease progresses. In many patients, the chorea reaches a peak at approximately 10 years after disease onset followed by a plateau and decline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], while bradykinesia and rigidity gradually become more prominent. Thus, treatment directed at chorea should be periodically reconsidered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3573685669\"><span class=\"h3\">Nonpharmacologic interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chorea may increase with anxiety and stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Providing a calm, predictable, and structured environment along with management of mood disorders may help to ameliorate these problems. Patients with severe chorea may benefit from the use of assistive equipment such as helmets, padded reclining chairs, low beds, and protective padding of the environment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1707217901\"><span class=\"h3\">Initial pharmacologic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest initial drug therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetrabenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetrabenazine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deutetrabenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">deutetrabenazine</a> for patients with HD who have moderately severe chorea that is refractory to nonpharmacologic measures. These drugs are dopamine depleting agents that act by inhibiting presynaptic vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2). The patient and family should be warned about the potential side effect of depression, which may be severe and rapid in onset. While depression may be triggered or exacerbated with tetrabenazine and deutetrabenazine, the latter may have a lower risk. When considering the use of these drugs, the risk of suicide must be weighed against the need for treatment of chorea. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Tetrabenazine'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1930925221\" class=\"local\">'Deutetrabenazine'</a> below.)</p><p>Benzodiazepines may be added intermittently when there is a transient worsening of chorea in stressful situations.</p><p>Atypical neuroleptics can be used as initial therapy for patients who have both chorea and agitation or psychosis.

In such cases, we suggest adding the neuroleptic drug and then gradually tapering tetrabenazine or deutetrabenazine once the chorea improves.</p><p>The choice among neuroleptics is largely empiric and is based upon clinical experience. In cases of moderate or more severe chorea, we prefer treatment with one of the second generation antipsychotic agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risperidone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olanzapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olanzapine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aripiprazole-short-acting-oral-and-injectable-and-long-acting-injectable-abilify-maintena-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aripiprazole</a>, since these may have fewer side effects than the first generation antipsychotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Rarely, first generation antipsychotics such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorpromazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorpromazine</a> can be tried. Caution should be used if parkinsonian features are present prior to starting these agents, as all neuroleptics can worsen these symptoms.</p><p>Combining <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetrabenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetrabenazine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deutetrabenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">deutetrabenazine</a> with a neuroleptic may be beneficial for patients with debilitating chorea who fail treatment with neuroleptic monotherapy. </p><p>For patients who do not respond to or tolerate the VMAT2 inhibitors (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetrabenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetrabenazine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deutetrabenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">deutetrabenazine</a>) or neuroleptic drugs, other treatment options include cannabinoids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amantadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amantadine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levetiracetam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levetiracetam</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topiramate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topiramate</a>.

Its mechanism of action involves blocking the transport of dopamine into vesicles in the presynaptic terminal. This depletes dopamine from the vesicles and reduces dopamine transmission.</p><p>In a double-blind controlled trial, ambulatory patients with HD were randomly assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetrabenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetrabenazine</a> at a maximum dose of 100 mg daily (n = 54) or placebo (n = 30) for 12 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Tetrabenazine treatment resulted in a significant reduction in chorea severity, measured as a change in the chorea score of the Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS), compared with placebo (5 versus 1.5 units, adjusted mean effect size -3.5, 95% CI -5.2 to -1.9). This change represented a clinically meaningful 24 percent reduction in chorea from baseline severity. Another randomized trial of 30 patients on tetrabenazine treatment for HD found that tetrabenazine withdrawal led to a statistically significant increase in the UHDRS chorea score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Based upon data from these two trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-management/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>], 2012 guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology concluded that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetrabenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetrabenazine</a> is likely effective in decreasing HD chorea to a very important degree [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetrabenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tetrabenazine</a> is an expensive medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

The dose can be increased to 12.5 mg twice daily after one week, and then by 12.5 mg increments at weekly intervals until chorea improves or side effects become troublesome. Tetrabenazine is usually given three times a day with meals. Since chorea disappears with sleep, a bedtime dose is not required.</p><p>Because <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetrabenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetrabenazine</a> is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP2D6), the manufacturer recommends genotyping to determine CYP2D6 expression for patients requiring doses &gt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. For poor metabolizers, the maximum recommended dose is 50 mg daily (25 mg per dose). For extensive or intermediate metabolizers, the maximum dose is 100 mg a day. When tetrabenazine is used with medications that are strong CYP2D6 inhibitors, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paroxetine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a>, the dose of tetrabenazine should be decreased by 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Adverse effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetrabenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetrabenazine</a> include sedation, akathisia, parkinsonism, and depressed mood. There is also a risk of suicidality. Among 54 patients assigned to tetrabenazine in a 12-week trial, there was one suicide, and poor tolerance led to a dose reduction in 44 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1930925221\"><span class=\"h4\">Deutetrabenazine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=deutetrabenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Deutetrabenazine</a>, the deuterated form of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetrabenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetrabenazine</a>, appears to be effective for reducing chorea in patients with HD.

(See <a href=\"#H2856068572\" class=\"local\">'Psychosis and agitation'</a> below.)</p><p>Few studies are available comparing different agents in HD. Thus, the choice among neuroleptics is largely empiric and based on clinical experience.

In patients with moderate chorea, the use of typical neuroleptics has been largely replaced by the use of atypical neuroleptics (ie, second generation antipsychotic agents), such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risperidone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olanzapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olanzapine</a>, which may have fewer side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Nevertheless, caution should be used if parkinsonian features are present prior to starting these agents, as all neuroleptics can worsen these symptoms.

In one 14-day open-label study, nine patients were treated with olanzapine starting at 5 mg daily, and the dose was increased every third day until an adverse event or a satisfactory response occurred, up to a maximum of 30 mg daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/huntington-disease-management/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on &quot;patient info&quot; and the keyword(s) of interest.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Basics topics (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=huntington-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: Huntington disease (The Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Huntington disease (HD) is a condition of relentless progression of motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms. Treatment is limited to symptom management and optimizing quality of life. The best care is provided by an interdisciplinary team (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F115528\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115528 \">table 1</a>) that addresses the broad physical and psychological needs of patients and families, and manages new issues as they arise through long-term follow-up. (See <a href=\"#H3298617407\" class=\"local\">'Multidisciplinary care'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3063359247\" class=\"local\">'Symptom management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palliative care focuses on preventing and relieving suffering and on supporting the best possible quality of life for patients and their families facing serious illness. Although HD is a chronic disease with a relatively slow course, the principles of palliative care are appropriate throughout the disease progression. End-of-life issues should be discussed with the patient and family. Advance care planning allows the patient to express views on the goals of care, future treatments, the place of care, and the place of death (eg, home, hospice, or hospital). These wishes can be incorporated into an advance directive to guide healthcare decision-making when capacity is lost. (See <a href=\"#H2781517475\" class=\"local\">'Palliative care and advance care planning'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specific problems that affect patients with HD include chorea, dystonia and other movement disorders, dysphagia, speech and language problems, gait impairment and falls, psychosis, agitation, depression, cognitive impairment and dementia, driving safety, and pain. (See <a href=\"#H3063359247\" class=\"local\">'Symptom management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The impact of chorea in patients with HD should be carefully assessed to determine whether any specific treatment is necessary, since it may not be a debilitating or bothersome symptom, particularly in early stages. Pharmacologic treatment of chorea may worsen other aspects of HD, including parkinsonism, cognition, and mood. When chorea does become severe, padded reclining chairs and bed padding are recommended to reduce the risk of injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with HD who have moderately severe chorea that does not respond to nonpharmacologic intervention, we suggest initial treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetrabenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetrabenazine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deutetrabenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">deutetrabenazine</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Atypical neuroleptics can be used as initial therapy for patients with both chorea and agitation or psychosis. Depression may be triggered or exacerbated with tetrabenazine and deutetrabenazine, although the latter may have a lower risk. (See <a href=\"#H3063359247\" class=\"local\">'Symptom management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Chorea'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Tetrabenazine'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1930925221\" class=\"local\">'Deutetrabenazine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with HD who have chorea that does not respond to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetrabenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetrabenazine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deutetrabenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">deutetrabenazine</a>, we suggest switching to treatment with a neuroleptic drug (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In cases of severe chorea, treatment with one of the more potent typical neuroleptic agents (ie, first generation antipsychotic agents) such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluphenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluphenazine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorpromazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorpromazine</a> may be helpful. In patients with moderate chorea, we prefer an atypical neuroleptic (ie, second generation antipsychotic agents), which may have fewer side effects. Choices include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olanzapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olanzapine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risperidone</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aripiprazole-short-acting-oral-and-injectable-and-long-acting-injectable-abilify-maintena-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aripiprazole</a>. For patients with debilitating chorea who fail treatment with neuroleptic monotherapy, the combination of tetrabenazine or deutetrabenazine with a neuroleptic may be helpful. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Neuroleptics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other movement disorders that may complicate HD include dystonia, rigidity, bradykinesia, tics, myoclonus, and impaired voluntary motor control. Rigidity and bradykinesia in HD generally do not require treatment. Furthermore, they seldom respond to addition of dopaminergic therapy, which may worsen psychiatric issues. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Other movement disorders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with HD who have psychosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> disruptive behavioral symptoms but lack debilitating chorea, we suggest initial treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quetiapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quetiapine</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olanzapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Olanzapine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risperidone</a> are alternative choices that may be preferred for patients who also have severe chorea. (See <a href=\"#H2856068572\" class=\"local\">'Psychosis and agitation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depression is a common symptom of HD and is usually managed with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants, though the later may be more likely to cause adverse effects. (See <a href=\"#H1327328367\" class=\"local\">'Depression'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no known effective therapy for dementia associated with HD.
