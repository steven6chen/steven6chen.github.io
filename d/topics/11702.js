It probably involves a combination of factors, including mucosal injury by cytotoxic drugs or other means, profound neutropenia, and impaired host defense to invasion by microorganisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutropenic-enterocolitis-typhlitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The microbial infection leads to necrosis of various layers of the bowel wall. The cecum is usually affected, and the process often extends into the ascending colon and terminal ileum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutropenic-enterocolitis-typhlitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The predilection for the cecum is possibly related to its distensibility and its diminished vascularization relative to the rest of the colon.</p><p>Gross and histologic examinations may reveal bowel wall thickening, discrete or confluent ulcers, mucosal loss, intramural edema, hemorrhage, and necrosis. Various bacterial <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fungal organisms are often seen infiltrating the bowel wall. Polymicrobial infection is frequent. (See <a href=\"#H538402040\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> below.)</p><p>Only rarely are inflammatory or leukemic infiltrates identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutropenic-enterocolitis-typhlitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H538402040\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, various bacterial <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fungal organisms, including gram-negative bacilli, gram-positive cocci, anaerobes (eg, <em>Clostridium septicum</em>), and <em>Candida</em> spp, are often seen infiltrating the bowel wall, and polymicrobial infection is frequent. Bacteremia or fungemia is also common; pathogens include <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, <em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Klebsiella</em> spp, viridans group streptococci, enterococci, <em>Bacteroides</em> spp, <em>Clostridium</em> spp, and <em>Candida</em> spp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutropenic-enterocolitis-typhlitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Recovery of <em>Clostridium septicum</em> from the bloodstream has been associated with a fulminant course and a high mortality rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutropenic-enterocolitis-typhlitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p><em>Candida</em> spp are the most common cause of fungal bloodstream infection in patients with neutropenic colitis; various <em>Candida</em> species have been detected in such patients, including <em>C. albicans</em>, <em>C. tropicalis</em>, <em>C. glabrata</em>, <em>C. krusei</em>, and <em>C. guilliermondii </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutropenic-enterocolitis-typhlitis/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>].

It has subsequently been described in children and adults with acute leukemia (especially acute myeloid leukemia), lymphoma, multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndromes, aplastic anemia, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, cyclic or drug-induced neutropenia, and after immunosuppressive therapy for solid malignancies and transplants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutropenic-enterocolitis-typhlitis/abstract/2-4,8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4,8-12</a>]. In one study, mucositis (odds ratio [OR] 31), hematopoietic cell transplantation (OR 59), and receipt of chemotherapy in the previous two weeks (OR 13) were significantly associated with the occurrence of neutropenic enterocolitis in pediatric patients with cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutropenic-enterocolitis-typhlitis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

In studies from the early 1990s, histologic findings of neutropenic enterocolitis were reported in up to 46 percent of childhood leukemia cases at autopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutropenic-enterocolitis-typhlitis/abstract/3,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,16</a>], with only one-third of patients being diagnosed before death in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutropenic-enterocolitis-typhlitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In a 2007 report, it was diagnosed in 3.5 percent of 317 episodes of severe neutropenia among individuals &gt;16 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutropenic-enterocolitis-typhlitis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The frequency of neutropenic enterocolitis appears to be increasing with the widespread use of cytotoxic agents, which cause gastrointestinal mucositis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutropenic-enterocolitis-typhlitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

All patients suspected of having neutropenic colitis should undergo abdominal CT scanning. Both oral and intravenous (IV) contrast should be given, when feasible. However, oral contrast is sometimes not tolerated in patients with severe gastrointestinal tract symptoms, and IV contrast is typically avoided in patients with renal insufficiency. (See <a href=\"#H17079661\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p>In addition to CT scanning, blood and stool cultures and <em>C. difficile</em> toxin assays should be performed.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Barium</a> enema is hazardous in the presence of potentially necrotic bowel, since it can cause perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutropenic-enterocolitis-typhlitis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Similarly, colonoscopy is relatively contraindicated in the presence of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, and air insufflation may precipitate cecal perforation. In those very few patients who underwent colonoscopic examination, mucosal irregularity with nodularity, ulcerations, and hemorrhagic friability, as well as a mass-like lesion mimicking carcinoma, have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutropenic-enterocolitis-typhlitis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17078960\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neutropenic enterocolitis, especially when it involves the right lower quadrant, can mimic acute appendicitis, and distinguishing between the two is important due to their different management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neutropenic-enterocolitis-typhlitis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Other terms that have been used to describe this syndrome include &quot;typhlitis,&quot; &quot;necrotizing enterocolitis,&quot; and &quot;ileocecal syndrome.&quot; (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathogenesis of neutropenic enterocolitis is incompletely understood. It probably involves a combination of factors, including mucosal injury by cytotoxic drugs or other means, profound neutropenia, and impaired host defense to invasion by microorganisms. The microbial infection leads to necrosis of various layers of the bowel wall. The cecum is usually affected, and the process often extends into the ascending colon and terminal ileum. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Various bacterial <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fungal organisms, including gram-negative bacilli, gram-positive cocci, anaerobes (eg, <em>Clostridium septicum</em>), and <em>Candida</em> spp, are often seen infiltrating the bowel wall, and polymicrobial infection is frequent. Bacteremia or fungemia is also common, usually with enteric organisms such as <em>Pseudomonas</em> or yeasts such as <em>Candida</em>. (See <a href=\"#H538402040\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neutropenic enterocolitis was originally reported in children who underwent induction chemotherapy for acute leukemia. It has subsequently been described in children and adults with acute leukemia (especially acute myeloid leukemia), lymphoma, multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndromes, aplastic anemia, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, cyclic or drug-induced neutropenia, and after immunosuppressive therapy for solid malignancies and transplants. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors and incidence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neutropenic enterocolitis must be considered in the differential diagnosis of any severely neutropenic patient (absolute neutrophil count &lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL),</span> who presents with fever and abdominal pain, usually in the right lower quadrant. Symptoms frequently appear during the third week after receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy, at a time when neutropenia is most profound and the patient is febrile. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neutropenic enterocolitis is usually diagnosed by detection of the characteristic computed tomography (CT) findings in neutropenic patients presenting with fever and abdominal pain and tenderness. All patients suspected of having neutropenic colitis should undergo abdominal CT scanning. CT findings include bowel wall thickening, mesenteric stranding, bowel dilatation, mucosal enhancement, and pneumatosis.
