Most thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) identified in patients over age 65 years are degenerative and share many of the same risk factors as abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA); inflammatory disorders such as giant cell arteritis are also associated with TAA, primarily in this age group. TAA identified in patients younger than 65 years is more often associated with a genetic predisposition that can be familial or related to defined genetic disorders such as Marfan syndrome. Approximately 25 percent of patients with thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) will also be found to have an AAA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-pathogenesis-and-natural-history-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. </p><p>The natural history of TAA is one of slow expansion with a progressive increase in the risk of aortic dissection at larger aortic sizes. The rate of aortic expansion depends upon aneurysm etiology, diameter, and location. Expansion rates for TAA are generally less than those of AAA. In addition, the generally slow expansion of TAA means that most patients with TAA are asymptomatic and many patients will succumb to other disease processes without being aware that TAA is present. Aneurysms that do produce symptoms are typically very large and at risk for rupture, which is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality.</p><p>This topic will review the etiology, risk factors, pathogenesis, and natural history of true thoracic aortic aneurysm. The clinical features, diagnosis, and management of thoracic aortic aneurysm, including surgical and endovascular repair, are discussed elsewhere.

However, these studies likely underestimate the prevalence of asymptomatic TAA in the general population since TAA was defined as aortic diameter &gt;5 cm; thus, TAAs between 4 and 5 cm were not included.</p><p>In two separate studies, the annual incidence of TAA was estimated to be 5.6 and 10.4 cases per 100,000 patient-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-pathogenesis-and-natural-history-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/3,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9</a>].

In studies performed where the population is stable and postmortem examinations are performed routinely, there appears to be a real increase in the incidence of TAA over the past several decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-pathogenesis-and-natural-history-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>].

Using sex-specific criteria for aneurysm, 4 percent of the patients being evaluated prior to AAA repair had an ascending aortic aneurysm and 6.5 percent had an aortic arch aneurysm. Furthermore, 2 percent of men had an ascending aortic aneurysm compared with 25.8 percent of the women, and 6.6 percent of men had an aortic arch aneurysm compared with 10.5 percent of the women. This study excluded patients with other risk factors for the development of ascending TAA such as bicuspid aortic valve, previous aortic surgery, and other genetic syndromes.

One radiologic study of 212 patients with a TAA who had undergone concurrent brain imaging for clinical reasons found intracranial aneurysms in 9 percent of patients, with a higher prevalence of cerebral aneurysm in patients with a descending versus ascending TAA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-pathogenesis-and-natural-history-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

At this diameter, the aorta loses its natural elasticity and effectively becomes a rigid tube. At a blood pressure of 200 mmHg, easily achieved through strenuous exercise or emotional distress, the stress generated in the wall of a 6.0-cm aorta can attain or exceed the maximum tensile strength of aortic tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-pathogenesis-and-natural-history-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. </p><p>Even though the risk of <span class=\"nowrap\">dissection/rupture</span> increases with aortic diameter, most patients who present with dissection have smaller aneurysms, probably because many more individuals in the population with thoracic aortic aneurysm have thoracic aortic diameters between 4.0 and 5.5 cm, which have a low risk for rupture. In a review of 591 patients with type A dissection enrolled in the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection (IRAD), the mean diameter was 5.3 cm. Nearly 60 percent of patients had aortic diameter&lt;5.5 cm, and 40 percent had aortic diameter &lt;5.0 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-pathogenesis-and-natural-history-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H388713718\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) is defined as a permanent localized dilation of the thoracic aorta, having at least a 50 percent increase in diameter compared with the expected normal diameter for that aortic segment. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>True aneurysms include all three layers of the vessel, including the intima, media, and adventitia. A pseudoaneurysm, or false aneurysm, is a collection of blood and connective tissue outside the aortic wall, usually the result of a focal rupture. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aneurysms of the thoracic aorta are classified by the segment of the aorta that is involved. (See <a href=\"#H388710705\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of TAA is estimated to be 6 to 10 cases per 100,000 patient-years. TAA is more common in men. The majority of TAAs are degenerative (sporadic) and associated with risk factors similar for atherosclerosis (eg, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoking). TAA is also associated with inflammatory <span class=\"nowrap\">disorders/vasculitis</span> (eg, giant cell arteritis, mycotic aneurysm, Takayasu's aortitis), bicuspid aortic valve disease, and genetically triggered connective tissue disorders such as Marfan, Loeys-Dietz, or vascular type Ehlers-Danlos syndromes. There are also familial associations with thoracic aneurysms, and it has been estimated that as many as 21 percent of patients with a thoracic aortic <span class=\"nowrap\">aneurysm/dissection</span> have a family history of this disorder independent of those with Marfan syndrome or a bicuspid aortic valve. (See <a href=\"#H388711763\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H388711771\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most TAAs result from alterations that lead to loss of structural integrity and aortic wall strength. A combination of breakdown of extracellular matrix proteins and mechanical factors are thought to cause medial degeneration, which occurs normally with aging but is accentuated by hypertension and other factors. Most theories emphasize the primary role of breakdown of the extracellular matrix proteins elastin and collagen by proteases such as collagenase, elastase, various matrix metalloproteinases, and plasmin (formed from plasminogen by urokinase plasminogen activator and tissue type plasminogen activator). Additional pathogenetic mechanisms involving abnormalities in cell signal processing occur in patients with genetically mediated TAA. (See <a href=\"#H388710740\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The natural history of TAA is generally one of slow expansion but with an increasing risk of dissection as aortic size increases. The rate of increase in aortic diameter ranges from 0.1 to 1.0 cm per year, depending upon TAA etiology, diameter, and location within the aorta.
