It frequently begins following a fracture, soft tissue injury, or surgery.</p><p>The etiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of CRPS in adults are reviewed here. Other aspects of CRPS in adults and children are presented separately.

The pain is regional (not in a specific nerve territory or dermatome) and usually has a distal predominance of abnormal sensory, motor, sudomotor, vasomotor, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> trophic findings. The syndrome shows variable progression over time.&quot;</p><p>There are many older alternative names for CRPS in the literature, including reflex sympathetic dystrophy, algodystrophy, causalgia, Sudeck atrophy, transient osteoporosis, and acute atrophy of bone. Upper extremity involvement following stroke or myocardial infarction was sometimes referred to as the &quot;shoulder-hand syndrome.&quot; In the modern era, these disorders are grouped under the single heading of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Two subtypes of CRPS have been recognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type I (the form also known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy) corresponds to patients with CRPS without evidence of peripheral nerve injury and represents about 90 percent of clinical presentations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type II was formerly termed causalgia and refers to cases in which peripheral nerve injury is present.</p><p/><p>However, the pathophysiologic basis for and clinical utility of the distinction between these two subtypes of CRPS is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3-5</a>].</p><p>Some investigators also recognize &quot;warm&quot; and &quot;cold&quot; subtypes of CRPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Warm&quot; CRPS is distinguished by increased skin temperature at the onset of symptoms, further suggesting this as an inflammatory type</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Cold&quot; CRPS is differentiated by decreased skin temperature at the onset of symptoms</p><p/><p>The term &quot;sympathetically maintained pain&quot; is considered to be a variable phenomenon associated with a variety of disorders, including CRPS types I and II.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of CRPS is unknown. Proposed mechanisms include classic inflammation, neurogenic inflammation, and maladaptive changes in pain perception at the level of the central nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>A number of studies suggest that patients with CRPS have significant increases in proinflammatory cytokines (eg, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-6, and TNF-alpha) in affected tissue as well as in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. Among the mechanisms proposed for the persistent pain and allodynia that are a hallmark of CRPS is the release of inflammatory mediators and pain-producing peptides by peripheral nerves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,12,13</a>]. Neuropeptides that produce pain and signs of inflammation when experimentally administered include substance P, neuropeptide Y, and calcitonin gene-related peptide. In a process known as neurogenic inflammation, nerve impulses that propagate in an antidromic fashion (that is, from proximal to distal in a sensory, particularly nociceptive, nerve axon) could lead to the release of neuropeptides. There may also be cross-talk between afferent and efferent nerves at a site of nerve injury. This model also offers a possible explanation for the phenomenon of allodynia, in which a normally painless stimulus to the affected limb, such as light touch, produces significant pain.</p><p>Another possible explanation for pain and allodynia in CRPS involves central sensitization, whereby increased activity in nociceptive afferents due to peripheral noxious stimuli, tissue damage, or nerve injury leads to increased synaptic transmission at somatosensory neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The role of the sympathetic nervous system in CRPS is unclear; however, autonomic manifestations previously ascribed to sympathetic overactivity could be due to catecholamine hypersensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] and may involve the formation of a reflex arc after an inciting event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The arc follows the routes of the sympathetic nervous system and is modulated by cortical centers to produce peripheral vascular disturbances. The pain sensation in response to injury may lead to increased sensitivity of injured axons to epinephrine and other substances released by local sympathetic nerves. The enhanced sensitivity can be blocked by the intravenous administration of sympatholytic agents.</p><p>The possible role of the central nervous system in the etiology of CRPS is based on studies suggesting cortical reorganization in sensory and motor regions of the brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>], which could result from persistent activity of primary nociceptive neurons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>Although data are limited, genetic factors also may be involved in the pathogenesis of CRPS. One case-control study reporting a significantly increased frequency of HLA-DQ1 among patients affected by CRPS type I [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The results of another study suggested that the phenotype of CRPS that progressed to develop multifocal or generalized dystonia was associated with HLA-DR3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H601318734\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CRPS is more common in women, with a female to male ratio of 2:1 to 4:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>]. The incidence appears to be highest in postmenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H601318796\"><span class=\"h2\">Inciting events</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common inciting events leading to CRPS are fractures, crush injuries, sprains, and surgery. However, no precipitating factors are identified in 0 to 10 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. In a retrospective population-based study of 74 cases of CRPS, the most frequent inciting events were fracture and sprain, seen in 46 and 12 percent of cases, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Various other precipitants, including crush, stroke, and contusion, were present in the remaining 42 percent of cases.</p><p>Several earlier reports suggested that psychosocial issues and personality traits acted as predisposing factors for CRPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>]. However, this notion remains controversial because subsequent studies have not confirmed such an association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main clinical symptoms of CRPS are pain, sensory changes, motor impairments, autonomic symptoms, and trophic changes in the affected limb [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The onset of CRPS generally occurs within four to six weeks of the inciting event (see <a href=\"#H601318796\" class=\"local\">'Inciting events'</a> above) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. The initial symptoms usually include pain, erythema, and swelling of the affected limb [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In most cases, the limb is warm initially, though some are cold at presentation or evolve from warm to cold. CRPS in adults more commonly occurs in the upper limbs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Involvement of both upper and lower limbs in the same patient is unusual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. However, the symptoms of CRPS may spread over time to involve adjacent areas of the affected limb or, occasionally, other ipsilateral or contralateral limbs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1488899332\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain is typically the most prominent and debilitating symptom of CRPS. The pain of CRPS is described as a burning, stinging, or tearing sensation that is felt deep inside the limb in most cases, though it may be superficial in some [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The pain is more often continuous but can be paroxysmal. Pain may be exacerbated by limb movement, contact, temperature variation, or stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4560230\"><span class=\"h2\">Sensory</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Various types of sensory abnormalities are common in CRPS.

Nevertheless, staging is still considered useful by a declining proportion of clinicians.</p><p>The purported stages are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 1 &ndash; Either after an event or without apparent cause, the patient develops pain in a limb. The essential features include burning, throbbing pain; diffuse, uncomfortable aching; sensitivity to touch or cold; and localized edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The distribution of the pain is not compatible with a single peripheral nerve, trunk, or root lesion. Vasomotor disturbances occur with variable intensity, producing altered color and temperature. The radiograph is usually normal but may show patchy demineralization.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 2 &ndash; The second stage is marked by progression of the soft tissue edema, thickening of the skin and articular soft tissues, muscle wasting, and the development of brawny skin. This may last for three to six months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 3 &ndash; The third stage is most severe and is characterized by limitation of movement, the shoulder-hand syndrome (capsular retraction producing a frozen shoulder), contractures of the digits, waxy trophic skin changes, and brittle, ridged nails.

Acute compartment syndrome is a surgical emergency that usually develops soon after significant trauma, particularly involving long bone fractures of the lower leg or forearm. Acute compartment syndrome may also occur following minor trauma or from nontraumatic causes such as ischemia-reperfusion injury, coagulopathy, certain animal envenomations and bites, extravasation of intravenous fluids, injection of recreational drugs, and prolonged limb compression. Early symptoms include progressive pain out of proportion to the injury; signs include tense swollen compartments and pain with passive stretching of muscles within the affected compartment.

The pain is not restricted to a specific nerve territory or dermatome and usually has a distal predominance of abnormal sensory, motor, sudomotor, vasomotor, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> trophic findings. The syndrome shows variable progression over time. (See <a href=\"#H1488898902\" class=\"local\">'Definition and terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The etiology and pathophysiology of CRPS are unknown. Proposed mechanisms include classic inflammation, neurogenic inflammation, and maladaptive changes in pain perception at the level of the central nervous system. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CRPS is more common in women than in men. The most frequent inciting events for CRPS are fractures and soft tissue injuries. CRPS seldom occurs in the absence of an identifiable trigger. (See <a href=\"#H601318734\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main clinical symptoms of CRPS are pain, sensory changes, motor impairments, autonomic symptoms, and trophic changes in the affected limb. Of these, pain is typically the most prominent and debilitating symptom. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of CRPS is based upon the clinical features as determined by the history and physical examination. Diagnostic criteria are based upon four <span class=\"nowrap\">symptom/sign</span> categories (sensory, vasomotor, <span class=\"nowrap\">sudomotor/edema,</span> and motor trophic) and require that the patient report one symptom in three of the four categories and display one sign at the time of evaluation in two of the four categories. Importantly, the criteria require that no other diagnosis better explains the symptoms and signs. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1488898819\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of CRPS includes a large number of conditions that can have some of the clinical features of CRPS, including (see <a href=\"#H24672865\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Infection of skin, muscle, joint, or bone</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Compartment syndrome</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Peripheral vascular disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Deep vein thrombosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Peripheral neuropathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Vascular thoracic outlet syndrome</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Rheumatoid arthritis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Raynaud phenomenon</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Erythromelalgia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Conversion and factitious disorders</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2043653\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Robert Sheon, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Harden RN, Bruehl S, Stanton-Hicks M, Wilson PR.
