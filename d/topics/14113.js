Maternal and perinatal complications during pregnancy in women with MS reflect the unfavorable interaction between the normal cardiovascular changes of pregnancy and the stenotic mitral valve. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-cardiovascular-and-hemodynamic-changes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Cardiovascular and hemodynamic changes&quot;</a>.) </p><p>This topic will review the evaluation and management of women with mitral stenosis during pregnancy. Management of other types of heart disease during pregnancy, including those with MS who have undergone valve replacement, is discussed separately.

In the United States and Canada, women with rheumatic heart disease, of which MS is the most common manifestation, comprise &lt;25 percent of the pregnant women with heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-mitral-stenosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Similarly, among 1321 women with heart disease included in an European Registry on Pregnancy and Cardiac disease (ROPAC), 334 had valve disease, of which 79 (6 percent) had mitral stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-mitral-stenosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In contrast, MS is a common condition in pregnant women with heart disease in other areas of the world where rheumatic heart disease is prevalent. For example, rheumatic heart disease was the underlying cause in 56 to 88 percent of women in three studies from centers from Brazil, Turkey, and Senegal reporting on a total of 1194 pregnancies in women with heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-mitral-stenosis/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].

The risk of pulmonary congestion remains during labor and delivery, as a result of uterine contraction during labor, and with the autotransfusion of venous return from the lower extremities as the emptied uterus is no longer impeding venous return. Increased atrial irritability and hypercoagulability associated with pregnancy, when combined with increased left atrial pressure, increase the risk of atrial fibrillation and left atrial thrombus formation.

There is an incremental increase in the frequency of maternal and fetal complications with increasing severity of MS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F83422\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83422 \">table 1</a>). While those with moderate or severe stenosis represent the higher risk group, elevated event rates are seen in those with even mild MS, reflecting the effects of the 30 to 50 percent increase in cardiac output superimposed on a mildly stenotic valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-mitral-stenosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. History of cardiac complications (including pulmonary edema, arrhythmias, transient ischemic attacks, or stroke) prior to pregnancy and poor baseline maternal functional class are additional risk factors for maternal cardiac complications during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-mitral-stenosis/abstract/1,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9</a>]. In the presence of obstetric risk factors (including extremes of maternal age, smoking), the presence of maternal MS confers a risk of perinatal complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-mitral-stenosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>There are no contemporary studies that have examined whether pre-existing pregnancy has any subsequent effect on the progression of disease or symptoms in women with MS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23166771\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURE AND FREQUENCY OF ADVERSE PREGNANCY OUTCOMES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23166779\"><span class=\"h2\">Maternal outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the four largest contemporary series from North America and Europe of pregnant women with mitral stenosis (MS) (total of 300 pregnancies), there were no maternal deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-mitral-stenosis/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. In the ROPAC study described above, 4 of 13 maternal deaths (among 1321 pregnant women) were in women with mitral stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-mitral-stenosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In the above cited South American study, among 448 cases of rheumatic valve disease (including 88 patients with MS of which 54 had with moderate to severe mitral stenosis), there were eight deaths (1.4 percent mortality) caused by heart failure due to severe native mitral disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-mitral-stenosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In a study of 46 pregnant women with MS from sub-Saharan Africa, the maternal mortality rate was even higher at 32 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-mitral-stenosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>Pregnant women with MS are at risk for pulmonary edema and atrial arrhythmias (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F83422\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83422 \">table 1</a>). As discussed above, cardiovascular changes during pregnancy result in an increase in the transmitral gradient and increased left atrial pressure, which in turn increases pulmonary venous pressure, placing pregnant women with MS at risk for pulmonary congestion. In a ROPAC substudy focusing on heart failure, among 79 women with MS, of whom 31 percent developed heart failure during pregnancy, the median time of first occurrence of heart failure was 25 weeks gestation with a wide interquartile range (13 to 37 weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-mitral-stenosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The risk of atrial fibrillation also increases during pregnancy, which in turn can precipitate pulmonary edema. Although atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia encountered, other supraventricular arrhythmias can be manifested, including atrial flutter and supraventricular tachycardia. Pulmonary congestion and atrial fibrillation can become a self-perpetuating vicious cycle, and it is not always clear which was the precipitating factor. The peak period of maternal cardiac complications is during the second and third trimester, but complications can occur in the peri- or postpartum period. In one series, 20 percent of the pulmonary edema episodes occurred in the setting of atrial tachyarrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-mitral-stenosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=supraventricular-arrhythmias-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Supraventricular arrhythmias during pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Only one stroke was reported in the above cited North American and European series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-mitral-stenosis/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>], perhaps due to increased vigilance and prompt initiation of anticoagulation. In the above cited series from South America, eight episodes of thromboembolism occurred in 448 patients with native mitral valves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-mitral-stenosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Even when pregnancy is not complicated by the development of pulmonary edema, some women with MS experience deterioration in their functional class or develop new cardiac symptoms. In the two largest North American series (total of 126 pregnancies), 74 and 40 percent of women experienced deterioration of one and two New York Heart Association functional classes, respectively, as their pregnancies progressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-mitral-stenosis/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>]. If not promptly diagnosed and treatment initiated, women who deteriorated to NYHA class III or IV will likely progress to frank pulmonary edema.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2739821\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perinatal complications, which include premature labor, low fetal weight, fetal complications of prematurity, and perinatal death, are generally increased in women with heart disease and are more frequent with increasing severity of mitral stenosis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2739596\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A careful cardiac history and physical examination, 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and a comprehensive transthoracic echocardiogram will provide the information necessary for the management of the woman with mitral stenosis (MS) who is either pregnant or is contemplating pregnancy.

It is possible that pulmonary hypertension is a surrogate for moderate or severe MS with marginal compensation, in which the hemodynamic stress of pregnancy would convert asymptomatic pulmonary hypertension to left or right heart failure. </p><p>Women with MS considering pregnancy should also be assessed by an obstetrician with expertise in medical disorders of pregnancy, to allow for an expert assessment of markers of obstetric risk and to address the obstetric aspects of management. Women with moderate or severe MS are at greatest risk of fetal neonatal complications such as perinatal death, premature delivery, low birth weight, or complications of prematurity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F83422\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83422 \">table 1</a>). Obstetric complications such as pregnancy induced hypertension and antepartum hemorrhage are not related to the severity of MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-mitral-stenosis/abstract/1,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23166793\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23166801\"><span class=\"h2\">Preconception counseling and management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation prior to preconception counseling includes identification of any markers of increased maternal cardiac risk as determined by history, examination, ECG, and transthoracic echocardiogram as described above (see <a href=\"#H23166786\" class=\"local\">'Risk stratification'</a> above): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of pulmonary edema, arrhythmias requiring treatment, transient ischemic attack, or stroke prior to pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Functional status by subjective (ie, New York Heart Association functional class) or objective measures (exercise testing).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central cyanosis (oxygen saturation &lt;90 percent by oximetry).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mitral valve area, extent of mitral regurgitation, left ventricular systolic function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systolic pulmonary artery pressure.</p><p/><p>At the time of prenatal counseling, attention should be paid to smoking history and the use of medications that may be potentially teratogenic. Cessation of smoking prior to conception would reduce the risk of perinatal complications. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) are contraindicated during pregnancy and should be discontinued prior to pregnancy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and receptor blockers in pregnancy&quot;</a>). Women who are receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> therapy should have the opportunity to make an informed decision about the various options for anticoagulation so that the anticoagulation plan can be implemented once pregnancy is confirmed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-anticoagulants-during-pregnancy-and-postpartum\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of anticoagulants during pregnancy and postpartum&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-care-initial-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal care: Initial assessment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59617712\"><span class=\"h3\">Indications for preconception intervention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Valve intervention prior to conception is recommended in women with moderate or severe MS (mitral valve area &le;1.5 cm<sup>2</sup>) who are symptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-mitral-stenosis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty performed in an experienced center is the intervention of choice, assuming that valve morphology is suitable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=percutaneous-mitral-balloon-valvotomy-for-mitral-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy for mitral stenosis&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The preconception management of asymptomatic women with moderate to severe MS is more controversial and requires consideration of patient and institution specific factors. The 2014 American Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/American</span> College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">(AHA/ACC)</span> valvular heart disease guideline recommended preconception percutaneous mitral balloon commissurotomy for asymptomatic patients with mitral valve area &le;1.5 cm<sup>2</sup> who have favorable valve morphology for percutaneous balloon commissurotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-mitral-stenosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The 2011 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines recommended that asymptomatic women with moderate or severe MS should avoid pregnancy and undergo prepregnancy intervention, favoring a percutaneous approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-mitral-stenosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. As both <span class=\"nowrap\">AHA/ACC</span> and ESC recommendations are based upon weak evidence (expert consensus or observational studies), practitioners should also consider other factors such as the presence of pulmonary hypertension, availability of local expertise for percutaneous intervention, patient factors, access of timely antenatal care, and valvular morphology in applying these recommendations.</p><p>In the asymptomatic women with moderate or severe mitral stenosis and normal pulmonary artery pressure, we recommend exercise testing to determine whether exercise capacity is normal and to evaluate for the presence of exercise induced pulmonary hypertension. We suggest not routinely intervening in women with moderate or severe MS who are asymptomatic with normal pulmonary artery pressure and excellent exercise capacity. However, in situations where patient compliance is an issue, or where there are barriers to provision of timely antenatal care or urgent percutaneous valvuloplasty, then there is a compelling reason to recommend elective percutaneous intervention for asymptomatic women with moderate to severe MS prior to pregnancy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23166808\"><span class=\"h2\">Antepartum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with MS should undergo cardiovascular assessment as early during pregnancy as possible, especially if there has been no opportunity for a prepregnancy assessment. The approach at the first antenatal visit is the same as for prepregnancy assessment, with additional attention to the cessation of medications that may be teratogenic, such as ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Patients with high risk features, such as severe MS or pulmonary hypertension, are best managed with a multi-disciplinary conference involving obstetrics, cardiology, perinatology, nursing, and social work to ensure that there is a written plan for follow-up during the antepartum period and also for labor and delivery.</p><p>The frequency of cardiac follow-up during pregnancy will be determined by the risk level. The 2011 ESC guidelines recommend monthly or bimonthly follow-up for moderate to severe MS (mitral valve area &lt;1.5 cm<sup>2</sup>), and at every trimester and prior to pregnancy for mild MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-mitral-stenosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. As pregnant women with MS will also be undergoing serial obstetric assessment, caregivers should consider establishing a combined clinic where cardiac and obstetric assessment can be scheduled during the same clinic visit, reducing the need for travel for patients in whom functional deterioration is common as pregnancy advances. </p><p>While there are no specific recommendations for echocardiographic assessments, at the minimum, an echocardiogram should be performed at the first antepartum visit and again during the third trimester visit. Transmitral gradient will increase as pregnancy progresses but pressure half-time and planimetry are less preload dependent methods to measure mitral valve area. Systolic pulmonary artery pressure may also increase.</p><p>At the time of each clinical assessment, history and signs of functional class deterioration, pulmonary congestion, and arrhythmias should be sought. Functional deterioration can be treated by a small dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a>, restriction of activities, and beta blockers (avoiding <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a> since its use is associated with low birthweight) to reduce tachycardia and improve LV filling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-mitral-stenosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Digoxin</a> can also be used but may be less effective in reducing heart rate than beta blockers, as renal clearance of digoxin is increased during pregnancy. Patients with pulmonary edema should be admitted to a hospital and treated with oxygen, intravenous furosemide, and introduction of beta blockers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-heart-failure-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of heart failure during pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Sustained or frequent palpitations should be promptly investigated. Atrial fibrillation and other supraventricular tachycardia should be treated to prevent deleterious effect on uteroplacental perfusion. The key considerations in treating atrial fibrillation in pregnant women with mitral stenosis are prompt initiation of anticoagulation and rhythm control to prevent thromboembolic episodes and the risk of pulmonary edema. Low molecular weight heparin, or intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> for hospitalized patients, is often used during pregnancy to avoid the potential teratogenicity and fetopathic effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>. Rate control with beta blockers or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> is the initial strategy for sustained atrial fibrillation. Beta blockers are more effective at heart rate control than digoxin as the renal clearance of digoxin is increased during pregnancy. As an elevated heart rate is crucial to maintain the augmented cardiac output in later pregnancy, the goal of ventricular rate control should be at 70 to 90 bpm rather than &lt;60 bpm as in nonpregnant state. Electrical cardioversion should be considered when the ventricular rate or symptoms are responding poorly to rate control or when there is hemodynamic instability. If possible, transesophageal echocardiography should be performed prior to electrical cardioversion to exclude left atrial thrombus, which would be a contraindication to electrical cardioversion. The fetal safety profile will need to be considered when choosing an antiarrhythmic agent for maintenance of sinus rhythm.

Intervention during pregnancy (preferably by percutaneous mitral valvotomy) is reserved for those patients with severe symptoms or heart failure despite maximal medical therapy and admission to hospital. Abdominal shielding should be employed and the procedure is best done past the period of organogenesis (&gt;20 weeks) but prior to mid to late third trimester when the gravid uterus can interfere with catheter access and hemostasis with the femoral approach.

With the use of regional anesthesia to attenuate the spikes in cardiac output during labor, almost all women with MS can undergo vaginal delivery with an assisted second stage. Caesarian delivery is reserved for obstetric indications and in whom anticoagulation cannot be reversed (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-labor-and-delivery-in-high-risk-heart-disease-general-considerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for labor and delivery in high-risk heart disease: General considerations&quot;</a>).

For those women who required ongoing anticoagulation, anticoagulation can be resumed once there is no evidence of early or late postpartum hemorrhage. </p><p>While there are no specific guidelines on the timing of postpartum assessments, cardiac assessment at four to six weeks postpartum will provide an opportunity to screen for postpartum deterioration, adjust cardiac medications, and discuss contraception choices. </p><p>Most cardiac medications are excreted in breast milk but in such small amounts that their use in lactating women is generally safe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-mitral-stenosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. An exception is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>, which affects the newborn thyroid, so breastfeeding is contraindicated during maternal use of amiodarone.</p><p>Contraception can be restarted based on guidelines extrapolated from non-heart disease population. In general, estrogen-based oral contraceptive can be utilized for most patients with MS except for those with increased thromboembolic risk such as severe MS, pulmonary hypertension, or New York Functional class IV as shown in the &quot;Valvular heart disease&quot; section of the accompanying table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F83911\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83911 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-mitral-stenosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Progesterone</a> based preparations are not associated with thromboembolic risk; irregular uterine bleeding is a common side-effect that results in high discontinuation rates. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-contraception-initiation-and-methods\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum contraception: Initiation and methods&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As the cardiovascular changes of pregnancy do not fully resolve until the sixth postpartum month, a repeat clinical assessment with echocardiography after the sixth postpartum month will serve as the baseline for future follow-up, including risk stratification for future pregnancies.
