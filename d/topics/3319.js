The injuries themselves may be primary or secondary. The classic injury pattern that is associated with shaking includes diffuse unilateral or bilateral subdural hemorrhage, diffuse multilayered retinal hemorrhages, and diffuse brain injury. This pattern has been referred to as the &quot;shaken baby syndrome&quot; and <span class=\"nowrap\">&quot;shaken/impact</span> syndrome&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-epidemiology-mechanisms-and-types-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The absence of a history of trauma and a paucity of external manifestations of injury can make recognition of the inflicted nature of these injuries difficult. The AAP has recommended that the term &quot;shaken baby syndrome&quot; be replaced in medical records with the broader term &quot;abusive head trauma&quot;, which allows for consideration of multiple mechanisms of injury in any child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-epidemiology-mechanisms-and-types-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Generic terms, such as &quot;head injury&quot;, also serve to distinguish the diagnosis of injury from the investigation of how the injury occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-epidemiology-mechanisms-and-types-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6</a>].</p><p>The mechanism of brain injury is only one factor that must be considered in making the diagnosis of abusive injury. The significance of the diagnosis (with regard to child protection and criminal prosecution) may be similar, regardless of whether injury resulted from direct blows or from shaking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-epidemiology-mechanisms-and-types-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In addition, much of the evidence to support the mechanism of injuries that result from shaking is retrospective and indirect.

Among young children, head injury, in particular, is often inflicted. This is illustrated in the following reports:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In several case series describing children who were admitted to the hospital with head injury, between 21 and 33 percent of injuries were inflicted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-epidemiology-mechanisms-and-types-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective report, injury was inflicted in 53 percent of children two years of age or younger with traumatic brain injuries, who were admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit, or died [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-epidemiology-mechanisms-and-types-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p>The incidence of abusive head trauma (AHT) among children is similar in the United States and Europe. In a population-based study conducted in the United States, the incidence of AHT among children younger than two years was 17 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI 13-21 per 100,000 person-years); the incidence was greater in the first than in the second year of life (30 versus 4 per 100,000 person-years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-epidemiology-mechanisms-and-types-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. Population-based studies from Europe report similar incidences of AHT in the first year of life (25 and 29 per 100,000 person-years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-epidemiology-mechanisms-and-types-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>More than 40 percent of deaths from child abuse occur among children younger than 12 months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-epidemiology-mechanisms-and-types-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Abusive head trauma is the most common cause of lethal physical abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-epidemiology-mechanisms-and-types-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Most fatal head injuries in children less than two years old are secondary to abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-epidemiology-mechanisms-and-types-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Head-injured infants frequently present with nonspecific clinical features and no history of trauma. As a result, as many as 30 percent of children with inflicted head injuries may be misdiagnosed at the initial evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-epidemiology-mechanisms-and-types-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Early identification of abusive head trauma can be lifesaving. In one retrospective review describing missed cases of abusive head injury, four of five deaths may have been prevented if the inflicted mechanisms had been recognized during prior medical evaluations for symptoms related to undisclosed head trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-epidemiology-mechanisms-and-types-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The probability of abusive head trauma increases with each associated high risk physical finding as discussed separately.

In three studies comparing children with AHT to those with an unintentional mechanism, the median age of those who had been abused was four months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-epidemiology-mechanisms-and-types-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/12,13,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13,26</a>]. Children with unintentional head injury were significantly older.

Child welfare agencies had been previously involved with 22 percent of families. In another study of AHT involving perpetrator confessions, repeated episodes of shaking were reported in 55 percent of cases and ranged from 2 to 30 events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-epidemiology-mechanisms-and-types-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Children diagnosed with abusive head trauma often have a history of prior skin or mouth injuries (&ldquo;sentinel injuries&rdquo;) that are known by the parents and at times, by medical providers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-epidemiology-mechanisms-and-types-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Limited evidence suggests that it is not unusual for clinicians to initially misinterpret nonspecific signs and symptoms of AHT (as an example, vomiting or irritability), leading to a delay in diagnosis. In one retrospective series, the diagnosis of AHT was missed in 31 percent of children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-epidemiology-mechanisms-and-types-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The most frequent diagnoses applied to children with missed abusive head trauma included viral gastroenteritis or influenza, accidental head injury, and &quot;rule out sepsis.&quot; Of those whose injuries were not recognized as inflicted, 28 percent were reinjured.

Of the 17 infants with intracranial hemorrhage, 16 had a SDH. Thus, limited evidence suggests that the majority of SDHs related to birth resolve within a few weeks, but this does not exclude the possibility of progression to chronic subdural hemorrhage in some cases. Additional data is necessary to clarify this issue.</p><p>In most cases of abusive head trauma, the subdural hemorrhage is eventually resorbed, but in some, the hyperdense blood seen on computed tomography evolves into a hypodense fluid collection, which may gradually increase in size. The time required for this evolution varies from a few days to weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-epidemiology-mechanisms-and-types-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. A sizable proportion of abused infants with head injury present with chronic subdural collections with or without additional acute injuries.

In one literature review where the prevalence of AHT was 47 percent, the presence of rib fractures in an infant with intracranial injury had a positive predictive value of 73 percent for AHT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-epidemiology-mechanisms-and-types-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. Inflicted rib fractures usually are nondisplaced and may involve single or multiple sequential ribs, and may occur unilaterally or bilaterally. Acute rib fractures are often difficult to detect clinically and radiographically when they are acute.

Cranial injury may be the result of direct blows or shaking (particularly of an infant), dropping, throwing the child, or a combination of mechanisms. The injury pattern that is associated with shaking includes subdural hemorrhage, retinal hemorrhage, and brain injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AHT occurs most often in the first year of life. The incidence of inflicted traumatic brain injury among children is similar in the United States and Europe. Many victims have a history of previous abuse, and the diagnosis is frequently delayed. The perpetrators of AHT are usually male and most commonly, the father of the infant. (See <a href=\"#H12000783\" class=\"local\">'Age'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12000790\" class=\"local\">'Prior history of abuse'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12000797\" class=\"local\">'Perpetrators'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Angular deceleration, with or without impact, results in differential movement of intracranial contents that causes axonal injury and intracranial bleeding. The infant brain is more susceptible to this type of injury. Normal handling and minor trauma typically do not generate sufficient force to cause serious injury. (See <a href=\"#H12000868\" class=\"local\">'Susceptibility'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12000825\" class=\"local\">'Primary injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypoxic-ischemic injury is also an important contributor to the types of brain injury seen after AHT. (See <a href=\"#H12000818\" class=\"local\">'Secondary injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injuries associated with AHT include skull (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83197\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83197 \">image 4</a>), metaphyseal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79186\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79186 \">image 6</a>), and rib fractures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83198\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83198 \">image 7</a>); retinal hemorrhages (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61192\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61192 \">figure 2</a>); and intracranial bleeding, especially subdural hemorrhage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83196\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83196 \">image 1</a>).
