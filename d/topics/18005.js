Among nonpregnant patients who are allergic to penicillin but who cannot be desensitized (or who require another regimen while completing the desensitization), we treat with TMP-SMX (10 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> [based on the TMP component] IV per day divided every 6 to 12 hours, with the higher end of the dosing range used in patients who are severely ill). TMP-SMX is well absorbed orally. An early transition to oral therapy with TMP-SMX is therefore appropriate in selected patients who can tolerate oral medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prognosis-and-prevention-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

There is some possibility of cross-reactivity between meropenem and penicillins in patients with type I, immunoglobulin (Ig)E-mediated allergy to penicillins. However, in patients with a history of a mild maculopapular rash to penicillin (ie, <strong>not</strong> an IgE-mediated reaction or Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, or drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms [DRESS]), meropenem is a reasonable alternative to ampicillin.

A retrospective study in 22 patients with meningoencephalitis suggested that the combination of ampicillin and TMP-SMX may be more effective than the combination of ampicillin and gentamicin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prognosis-and-prevention-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipenem-and-cilastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Imipenem</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meropenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meropenem</a> have excellent in vitro activity against <em>Listeria</em>.

(See <a href=\"#H3535674814\" class=\"local\">'Avoidance of delay'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Listeria monocytogenes</em> is susceptible to common antimicrobial agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a>, penicillin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (TMP-SMX), and in vitro resistance to these drugs is rare. Ampicillin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-g-intravenous-and-short-acting-intramuscular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillin G</a> are the drugs of choice. However, these antibiotics demonstrate delayed in vitro bactericidal activity at concentrations attainable in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). As a result, gentamicin is often added to achieve synergy for listerial CNS infections, endocarditis, and infections in immunocompromised patients. Drug doses are provided above. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic regimens'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Penicillin-allergic patients can be skin tested and desensitized if necessary or treated with TMP-SMX. The usual dose of TMP-SMX is 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (based on the TMP component) intravenously (IV) every 6 to 12 hours, with the higher end of the dosing range used in patients who are severely ill. (See <a href=\"#H1654173516\" class=\"local\">'Regimens for patients with penicillin allergy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients treated with immunosuppressive drugs (eg, because of solid organ transplantation), we favor decreasing the level of immunosuppression whenever feasible, particularly if there is not a prompt clinical response to initial antimicrobial therapy. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'High-risk patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Type of infection</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with listerial CNS infection, bacteremia, endocarditis, or infection in immunocompromised hosts or neonates, we recommend treating with IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). We also suggest adding <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> to achieve synergy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'High-risk patients'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic regimens'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among immunocompetent patients with listerial febrile gastroenteritis, we suggest not treating since it is almost always a self-limited illness (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Febrile gastroenteritis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> be given for several days in immunocompromised, pregnant, or older adult patients with listerial febrile gastroenteritis, particularly if they are still symptomatic or have ingested a food implicated in an outbreak (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Febrile gastroenteritis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among pregnant women with isolated listerial bacteremia, we suggest treatment with IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a> alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> is an alternative in penicillin-allergic patients, it should be avoided in the first trimester, since <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> metabolism may be affected, or the last month of pregnancy to avoid kernicterus in the fetus. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Vancomycin</a> is an alternative agent among pregnant patients who become infected during a period when TMP-SMX cannot be given and who have a history of serious allergy to penicillin but cannot be desensitized. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Pregnant women'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Duration</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In immunocompetent patients including pregnant women and neonates, we treat for a minimum of two weeks of antibiotic therapy for bacteremia and three to four weeks for CNS infection. In immunocompromised patients, we treat for three to six weeks for bacteremia and four to eight weeks for CNS infection. The longer duration particularly applies to patients with cerebritis or brain abscess. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Duration of therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> is added to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a> for synergy, we continue it until the patient improves (usually 7 to 14 days) or, in poor responders, for up to three weeks if there are no signs of nephrotoxicity or ototoxicity. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Duration of therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Monitoring</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The response to therapy is monitored clinically (temperature, clinical signs, and symptoms). In patients who remain persistently febrile or who have other signs or symptoms suggesting a poor response after several days of therapy, we repeat blood cultures and, in patients with CNS infection, CSF cultures and, if initially abnormal, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring during therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After antibiotics are discontinued, the patient should be monitored for signs of clinical relapse. End-of-treatment CSF examination is not necessary if a previously negative CSF culture was documented during therapy. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring during therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H641771664\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Food safety precautions for prevention of listeriosis are summarized above.

Survivors of cerebritis (particularly cerebral abscess) or rhombencephalitis have a high rate of persistent neurologic sequelae. In contrast, patients with no underlying disease generally do well.
