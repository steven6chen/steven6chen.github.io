(See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Genetic and antigenic characterization'</a> below.)</p><p>Illness with influenza in pigs was first recognized during the influenza pandemic of 1918 to 1919, and a swine influenza virus was first isolated from a human in 1974 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-pandemic-h1n1-influenza-swine-influenza/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. In 1976, swine influenza virus caused a respiratory illness with one fatality among 13 soldiers in Fort Dix, New Jersey [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-pandemic-h1n1-influenza-swine-influenza/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. No exposure to pigs was found. A subsequent epidemiologic study showed that up to 230 soldiers had been infected with the virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-pandemic-h1n1-influenza-swine-influenza/abstract/6,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10</a>].</p><p>Between 1958 and 2005, 37 cases of swine influenza among civilians were reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-pandemic-h1n1-influenza-swine-influenza/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Six cases (17 percent) resulted in death. Forty-four percent of infected individuals had known exposure to pigs. Cases were reported in the United States, former Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands, Russia, Switzerland, and Hong Kong. In 2008, an outbreak of triple reassortant swine influenza was detected among university students who visited a livestock event in South Dakota after one student became ill [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-pandemic-h1n1-influenza-swine-influenza/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Among 42 exposed students who provided serum samples, 17 (40 percent) were seropositive and 5 (12 percent) met the case criteria for infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY OF THE 2009 TO 2010 PANDEMIC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In March 2009, an outbreak of respiratory illnesses was first noted in Mexico, which was eventually identified as being related to H1N1 influenza A [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-pandemic-h1n1-influenza-swine-influenza/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The outbreak spread rapidly to the United States, Canada, and throughout the world as a result of airline travel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-pandemic-h1n1-influenza-swine-influenza/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Influenza activity peaked in October 2009 and then declined rapidly to below baseline levels in January 2010. An elevated percentage of outpatient visits for influenza-like illness occurred an average of 14 days after schools opened, which suggests that transmission in schools catalyzed community-wide transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-pandemic-h1n1-influenza-swine-influenza/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>More than 214 countries and territories reported laboratory-confirmed cases of pandemic H1N1 influenza A [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-pandemic-h1n1-influenza-swine-influenza/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In early July 2009, the WHO ceased closely tracking the number of cases because it had become difficult for countries to continue such monitoring in the setting of widespread community transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-pandemic-h1n1-influenza-swine-influenza/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Furthermore, even with close tracking, the true numbers of cases were many-fold higher than the numbers of confirmed cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-pandemic-h1n1-influenza-swine-influenza/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Estimated cases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A modeling study suggested that by late July 2009, the number of individuals infected with pandemic H1N1 influenza A in the United States may have been up to 140 times greater than the reported number of confirmed cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-pandemic-h1n1-influenza-swine-influenza/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Using the same methodology, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that between April 2009 and April 10, 2010, approximately 61 million cases of pandemic H1N1 influenza occurred in the United States, including approximately 274,000 hospitalizations and 12,470 deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-pandemic-h1n1-influenza-swine-influenza/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Rates of infection by age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rate of infection in the United States was highest among individuals &le;24 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-pandemic-h1n1-influenza-swine-influenza/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>].

A cross-sectional serologic survey that compared serum samples from 2008 and September of 2009 suggested that approximately one in three children had acquired pandemic H1N1 influenza A infection; these rates were 10 times higher than estimates based on clinical surveillance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-pandemic-h1n1-influenza-swine-influenza/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Pandemic H1N1 influenza A infections were uncommon in persons older than 65 years, possibly as a result of preexisting immunity against antigenically similar influenza viruses that circulated prior to 1957 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-pandemic-h1n1-influenza-swine-influenza/abstract/16,27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,27-29</a>]. For example, in a study of more than 1400 serum samples taken in 2008, preexisting cross-reactive antibodies to the 2009 to 2010 pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus were found in 1.8 percent of children &lt;4 years of age compared with 31 percent of adults &ge;80 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-pandemic-h1n1-influenza-swine-influenza/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].
