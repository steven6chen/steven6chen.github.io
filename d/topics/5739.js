(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dyslipidemia-in-children-definition-screening-and-diagnosis#H4809106\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dyslipidemia in children: Definition, screening, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Benefits of screening'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dyslipidemia-in-children-definition-screening-and-diagnosis#H435122678\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dyslipidemia in children: Definition, screening, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Association with atherosclerosis and CVD'</a>.)</p><p>Evidence establishing the long-term effectiveness of lipid-lowering interventions in children comes largely from studies in children with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a group at high risk for morbidity and early mortality. Lipid-lowering therapy in children with FH decelerates the atherosclerosis process as assessed by subclinical vascular findings (eg, carotid intima-media thickness [cIMT]). Long-term outcome data are not available for the general pediatric population; however, it is reasonable to assume based on evidence from adult studies and limited pediatric data that timely intervention to decrease and possibly eliminate dyslipidemia in children may decelerate the atherosclerotic process, which would prevent or delay the onset of CVD. (See <a href=\"#H29546504\" class=\"local\">'Familial hypercholesterolemia'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dyslipidemia-in-children-definition-screening-and-diagnosis#H435128194\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dyslipidemia in children: Definition, screening, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Familial hypercholesterolemia'</a>.)</p><p>In a study of pediatric patients with heterozygous FH, children treated with a low saturated fat diet and statin therapy had regression in cIMT, while control patients treated with a standard diet and placebo therapy demonstrated the expected progression of increased cIMT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyslipidemia-in-children-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In a follow-up report, earlier initiation of statin therapy correlated with smaller increases in cIMT, suggesting that earlier intervention delayed progression of atherosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyslipidemia-in-children-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Ten-year follow-up of 194 (91 percent) of the patients enrolled in the original study (average age at follow-up 24 years) demonstrated that treatment with statin therapy during childhood slowed the rate of cIMT progression to that of their non-affected siblings, and earlier initiation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pravastatin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">pravastatin</a> was associated with less thickening of cIMT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyslipidemia-in-children-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>In another study of children with FH, statin therapy was associated with improved endothelial function (assessed by flow-mediated dilation [FMD], an indirect measurement of atherosclerosis) compared with patients who received placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyslipidemia-in-children-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. FMD measurements in statin-treated patients approached the level of normal control children without FH.</p><p>Meta-analyses of randomized placebo-controlled trials have shown that the use of statin therapy in children with FH is effective in reducing LDL-C levels and is not associated with significant adverse effects (ie, hepatic and muscular toxicity and effects on sexual development) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyslipidemia-in-children-management/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]; no serious adverse events were reported in the 10-year follow-up study described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyslipidemia-in-children-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Of note, however, these trials were not designed to detect very rare or long-term adverse effects. (See <a href=\"#H29546504\" class=\"local\">'Familial hypercholesterolemia'</a> below.)</p><p>Several organizations (including the American Heart Association [AHA], American Academy of Pediatrics [AAP], the National Lipid Association [NLA], and the National Cholesterol Education Program [NCEP]) and an expert panel sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) concluded that intervention in children with dyslipidemia is warranted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyslipidemia-in-children-management/abstract/1,8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8-11</a>]. This approach is based on the premise that many of these children are likely to have FH, and the belief that the consequences of elevated LDL in non-FH patients are likely to contribute to accelerated atherosclerosis and CVD.</p><p>Because there is a lack of direct evidence linking drug treatment with a reduction in CVD, some experts question the risk-benefit of pharmacologic therapy in children with dyslipidemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyslipidemia-in-children-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In one commentary, the authors point to the potential pitfalls of using lipid levels as a surrogate marker for CVD, since not all individuals with dyslipidemia go on to develop CVD events.

There is good evidence that a low saturated fat diet reduces the levels of TC and LDL-C in healthy children.

There is some evidence that more restrictive diets (ie, limiting total fat to 25 percent of total calories) can more effectively reduce LDL-C; however, adherence to more restrictive diets is difficult and may foster noncompliance and stress between the child and parents. We emphasize the intake of &quot;good&quot; fats (mono- and polyunsaturated fats) as a substitute for saturated and trans fats because of their beneficial effects on cardiovascular health.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In one study of prepubertal children with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) following a diet low in total fat (23 &plusmn; 5 percent of total calories), saturated fat (8 &plusmn; 2 percent of total calories), and cholesterol (67 &plusmn; 28 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/1000</span> kcal) for one year, resulted in reductions in TC and LDL-C levels by 4 and 5.5 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyslipidemia-in-children-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

The benefit of other supplements (eg, fiber) to reduce LDL-C is less clear. The following is a summary of these supplements, which are discussed in greater detail separately.

In adults, supplementation with these compounds has been shown to reduce dietary cholesterol by 5 to 10 percent. One study in healthy children showed that a mean intake of 1.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> of plant sterol contained in a margarine product reduced serum LDL-C by 8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyslipidemia-in-children-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Fiber is thought to bind with cholesterol within bile acids, thus removing it from the enterohepatic circulation. Supplemental fiber is usually required as a daily dose of 6 grams for children ages 2 to 12 years and 12 grams for children ages 12 years and older. In our practice, we prefer that children consume fiber from dietary sources (eg, fruit, vegetables, and whole grains) and generally do not recommend fiber supplements.

Red yeast rice extract, which contains monacolins with statin-like activity, has been shown to lower cholesterol in adults.

Omega-3 fatty acids, as found in fish oil supplements, are not recommended for children with hypercholesterolemia as they may increase LDL-C levels.

Pravastatin, atorvastatin, simvastatin, and lovastatin are available in generic forms. The initial choice of agent is generally based on potential drug interactions, price, and patient preference. Treatment is initiated at the lowest dose (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69650\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69650 \">table 5</a>), which is given once a day, usually at bedtime, because most LDL-C synthesis occurs during nighttime hours. If needed, the dose is increased to meet the goals of therapy. (See <a href=\"#H338113\" class=\"local\">'Goals of therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H339707\" class=\"local\">'Dose titration'</a> below.)</p><p>Several clinical trials in children with FH demonstrated that statin therapy, compared with placebo, decreases serum LDL-C without significant adverse side effects over several years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyslipidemia-in-children-management/abstract/2,3,5-7,27-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,5-7,27-32</a>]. The duration of follow-up has been insufficient to prove statin therapy during childhood lowers the risk of future CVD. However, measures of preclinical atherosclerosis (eg, carotid intima-media thickness [cIMT], flow-mediated dilation [FMD]) suggest statin therapy slows the progression of subclinical atherosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyslipidemia-in-children-management/abstract/2,3,5,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,5,33</a>], and that these benefits of early treatment are sustained over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyslipidemia-in-children-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

The sequestrants are extremely safe, as they are not absorbed systemically, but remain in the gut and are excreted along with the bile containing cholesterol. For patients with severe LDL-C elevations (heterozygous FH) who are able to be very compliant and do not experience bloating or constipation, the sequestrants can effectively lower LDL-C as much as 10 to 20 percent. They can be used in patients who prefer to avoid statins, although they may not achieve sufficient LDL lowering to reach goal.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-elevated-low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-ldl-c-in-primary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of elevated low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-disease-risk-assessment-for-primary-prevention-risk-calculators\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular disease risk assessment for primary prevention: Risk calculators&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In contrast, an outcomes-based scoring system is not feasible in children because of the lack of available pertinent data and therefore it is not possible to accurately estimate a child's individual risk for CVD. A global CVD risk approach for children (based on lipid levels and other CVD risk factors and conditions) is recommended by the AHA, American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and the NHLBI Expert Panel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyslipidemia-in-children-management/abstract/9,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,49</a>].

Adult risk assessment scores, which were developed based on the CVD risk in a general population, should not be used in individuals with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) who have a lifetime risk for CVD events that is not adequately captured by these scores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyslipidemia-in-children-management/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This point was underscored in the Third Report of the Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults, which stated, &quot;Most young adults with very high low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels (&ge;190 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> are candidates for cholesterol-lowering drugs, even when they are otherwise at low risk with 0-1 risk factor and 10-year risk &lt;10 percent. Although their 10-year risk may not be high, long-term risk will be high enough to justify a more aggressive approach to LDL lowering&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyslipidemia-in-children-management/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. This is because these individuals likely have FH, and therefore are not appropriate candidates for the Framingham risk score.</p><p/><p>The differences in these two approaches may result in a discrepancy of recommendations regarding statin therapy as older adolescents transition their care from pediatric to adult primary care clinicians. A study comparing the number of young adults (age 17 to 21 years) meeting criteria for pharmacologic treatment of elevated LDL-C levels under pediatric versus adult guidelines, found that &gt;400,000 more young adults might be treated with statins if the pediatric guidelines are applied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyslipidemia-in-children-management/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].

For patients on stable statin doses, these laboratory tests are obtained every six months. Although data on long-term statin use in adults suggest a safe profile, the long-term safety of statin therapy initiated in childhood is uncertain.

Second-line lipid-altering agents encompass several classes of drugs that differ with respect to mechanism of action and to the degree and type of lipid lowering. These include cholesterol absorption inhibitors (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ezetimibe-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ezetimibe</a>), bile acid sequestrants, fibric acid derivatives, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b3-niacin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">niacin</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69650\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69650 \">table 5</a>).

The differences in these two approaches may result in a discrepancy of recommendations regarding statin therapy as older adolescents transition their care from pediatric to adult primary care clinicians.
