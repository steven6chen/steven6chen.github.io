Most patients have no associated symptoms, and repair usually is for cosmetic indications.</p><p>The definition, clinical features, and management of pectus carinatum will be presented here. Pectus excavatum, which is the most common chest wall deformity and is characterized by depression of the sternum, is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pectus-excavatum-etiology-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pectus excavatum: Etiology and evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pectus-excavatum-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pectus excavatum: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pectus carinatum is a protrusion deformity of the anterior chest wall. The term is derived from the Latin phrase for &quot;chest with keel&quot;. Other terms for the deformity include chicken breast, pigeon chest, pyramidal chest, thorax cuneiform, or sternal kyphosis. There are two main types of pectus carinatum deformity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Chondrogladiolar prominence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chondrogladiolar prominence, also known as chicken breast or keel chest, is the most common type of deformity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. The middle and lower portions of the sternum protrude and arch forward. The costal cartilages are concave and usually symmetrically depressed, accentuating the sternal prominence. The deformity is asymmetric in 30 to 50 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Infrequently, patients can have a combined pectus carinatum on one side of the chest and pectus excavatum on the other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Chondromanubrial prominence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chondromanubrial prominence, also known as Pouter pigeon breast, is a more complex and substantially less common form of pectus carinatum deformity, representing about 5 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. In this form, the upper portion of the sternum protrudes anteriorly, and the body of the sternum is deviated posteriorly. A final anterior deflection of the distal sternum gives the characteristic Z-shape to the sternum on a lateral view. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pectus carinatum is an uncommon deformity that occurs in approximately 1 per 1500 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. It is four times more common in males than females. There is a strong familial incidence, with up to 25 percent of affected patients reporting chest wall abnormalities in family members [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/2,5,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,8,9</a>].</p><p>Most reports suggest that pectus carinatum occurs fivefold less often than pectus excavatum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, one group from Argentina reported pectus carinatum as being more common than pectus excavatum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Pectus carinatum appears to be more common in the Caucasian and Hispanic populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Pectus carinatum that is not clinically obvious can be an incidental finding on imaging of the chest performed for other reasons. In one series, subclinical pectus carinatum deformity was noted on 2 percent of computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cause of pectus carinatum is unknown.

The defect often worsens dramatically during the adolescent growth spurt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Fewer than 10 percent will have a severe defect by three years of age. Spontaneous improvement of pectus carinatum does not occur. Most patients with untreated isolated pectus carinatum deformity have no associated morbidity or mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/2,5,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,8,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For many patients evaluated for pectus carinatum, cosmetic appearance is the primary concern and there are few physiologic complaints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].</p><p>By contrast, in one series of 260 patients who underwent surgical correction of pectus carinatum, the majority of patients complained of exertional dyspnea, exercise limitation, frequent respiratory infections, or asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These symptoms improved in almost all patients after surgical repair based on subjective reporting by the patients. After operative repair, the mean improvement in vital capacity as measured by incentive spirometry was 12.5 percent in a subset of 105 patients. However, the preoperative baseline vital capacity as a percent of predicted was not reported. In most other series, objective abnormalities are usually lacking. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Additional testing'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Associated musculoskeletal abnormalities are frequent, occurring in 22 percent of patients in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Spinal anomalies or scoliosis are most common, occurring in 15 to 30 percent of affected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/4,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,23,24</a>].</p><p>Pectus carinatum may be associated with Marfan syndrome, Noonan syndrome, cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, Poland syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, Coffin-Lowry syndrome, and Morquio disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Occasionally, there is tenderness on palpation of the anterior chest wall over the deformity.</p><p>The examination should document the type of deformity (chondrogladiolar or chondromanubrial, or mixed <span class=\"nowrap\">carinatum/excavatum)</span> and degree of asymmetry. The patient should be examined for scoliosis and other associated abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Associated abnormalities'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Photography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Photographs are helpful for objective documentation and comparison with previous examinations. They are particularly helpful in young patients with evolving deformities, and in patients undergoing surgery to measure outcomes after treatment. Special photographic techniques illustrate body wall topography more precisely than plain photography, but are not widely available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/5,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,26,27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Chest imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chest radiographs are useful to establish the severity of the deformity (lateral projection) and to detect scoliosis (anterio-posterior projection).</p><p>Computed tomography (CT) of the chest can be used to monitor sternal protrusion by measurement of the angle at the point of greatest sternal rotation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The pectus severity index (PSI), also known as the Haller index, is defined as the width of the chest divided by the distance between the sternum and spine. The normal value is 2.54 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In patients with pectus carinatum, a lower PSI indicates a more severe deformity in contrast to patients with excavatum, in which a higher PSI indicates a more severe deformity. In one group of 260 subjects with pectus carinatum, the mean PSI was 1.81 (range 1.19-2.10) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], and in another study the mean PSI was 1.73 (range 1.42 to 1.98) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The chest CT can also be used to calculate the asymmetry index (ratio of A-P diameter of the left to right thorax) and the angle of sternal rotation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. &#160; &#160;</p><p>In our practice, we only use CT scans for preoperative planning for patients who are selected to undergo operative repair. In patients with focal protrusion of one or more costal cartilages, sonographic imaging can be helpful in differentiating a malformed cartilage from a neoplastic rib mass.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Additional testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, no additional routine testing is needed to evaluate patients with pectus carinatum, and a thorough history and physical examination are sufficient to determine if any additional testing is necessary. Tests are usually limited to investigation of associated disorders (eg, scoliosis), symptoms (eg, dyspnea), or possible syndromes. </p><p>When cardiorespiratory function is measured in patients with pectus carinatum, results are usually normal. In one report of five patients, pulmonary function tests and work exercise performance were normal and did not change after surgical repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In rare cases associated with severe scoliosis, restrictive lung disease can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pectus carinatum is primarily a cosmetic concern. The decision of whether to treat depends on the severity of the defect (anterior chest protrusion, sternal angulation, and asymmetry), and the patient and family's level of concern. Thus, the indications for treatment cannot be captured in an objective measure. In this topic review, we define a &quot;mild&quot; deformity as one for which most patients would not choose to have surgery; a &quot;moderate&quot; deformity as a distinct deformity for which many patients would choose to have surgery; and a &quot;severe&quot; deformity as a substantial cosmetic problem for which most patients would choose to have surgery. </p><p>Both bracing and surgery provide safe and effective treatment. Bracing is a relatively new approach to treatment of pectus carinatum. The optimal indications for bracing, and relative advantages and disadvantages compared with surgical approaches are not established. In our practice, we generally take the following approach, recognizing that it is based on limited data:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Candidates for bracing &mdash; We offer bracing to patients with mild or moderate pectus carinatum if expertise in this technique is readily available. During the evaluation for bracing, it is critically important to evaluate the flexibility of the chest, because bracing is more difficult in patients with skeletally mature, stiffer chest walls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Candidates for surgery &mdash; We believe that surgery is more likely to be effective than bracing for patients with severe pectus carinatum, for those who are unable to be compliant with the rigorous bracing schedule, and possibly for older patients. Surgery may also be more effective for patients with greater degrees of sternal asymmetry, as described below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Surgical intervention is also an acceptable approach for patients with milder degrees of pectus carinatum.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Bracing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with a flexible deformity, the deformity may be improved by bracing. A flexible defect is one that can be manually corrected by moderate compression on the initial physical exam [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The advantage of bracing is the decreased morbidity and improved cosmesis of a nonsurgical approach, as well as substantial cost savings as compared to surgical correction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Protocols</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of bracing protocols have been described:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients wore the brace for 23 hours per day for approximately two to six months until the defect was corrected, then for eight hours per day until skeletal maturation is complete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. Of these patients 55 percent maintained correction during an average of 13.8 months of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients wore the brace for 14 to 16 hours per day for a minimum of two years or until growth was completed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. There was significant improvement by six months and almost compete resolution by 12 months, with no further improvement after 18 months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients wore the brace for 8 to 12 hours per day until the chest was flattened, then about 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">hours/day</span> for six more months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Compared with a more rigorous protocol (&gt;12 hour per day), this protocol led to similar treatment success rates (85 percent) and time to correction (7.3 months) with better protocol adherence (90 percent).</p><p/><p>In general, patients with more flexible chest walls will require less pressure to correct the deformity and can be corrected with a shorter interval of time, but they will need to wear the brace for a longer period of time each day (up to 20 hours). Patients with stiffer chest walls will require a higher pressure of correction and a longer treatment duration but will only need to wear the brace for 8 to 12 hours per day.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several case series report that bracing leads to improvement or resolution of the pectus deformity in at least 75 to 90 percent of patients who comply with the protocol; the efficacy of bracing appears to be associated with degree of compliance with the bracing protocol and with earlier pubertal status at the start of bracing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/6,35,36,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,35,36,38,39</a>]. In one of these series, self-reported satisfaction with physical appearance increased from 2.9 pre-bracing to 4.3 on a 5 point scale [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Among compliant patients, those that had not reached Tanner Stage IV required 4.2 &plusmn; 0.9 months to reach full correction, while those who started bracing after reaching Tanner stage IV needed 8.0 &plusmn; 7.1 months of bracing to get a full repair. In this series, 45 percent of the patients entering the protocol were deemed treatment failures, most of these due either to loss to follow-up or to marked noncompliance with the protocol; only 2 percent of the patients did not achieve improvement despite good compliance with the protocol. Thus, bracing protocols appear to be challenging to complete, but, among those patients who do, there is a high success rate. The authors suggest that the use of a brace in which the patient can adjust the compression pressure is associated with a higher rate of compliance and with greater overall success. In another series of patients between 5 and 28 years of age treated with bracing, there was a trend toward greater satisfaction in patients who had bracing before 19 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>A small series suggested that four patients who failed bracing despite compliance had a significantly higher pectus severity index and asymmetry index and greater angle of sternal rotation as compared to 24 patients for whom bracing was successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. This suggests that patients with complex pectus carinatum defects may not be good candidates for bracing, though more research needs to be done to clarify this. </p><p>One series of 209 patients described the use of a customized brace with a dynamic compressor system, which was adjusted to reflect the compression force needed to correct the deformity and also allowed lateral expansion of the chest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The length of treatment and cosmetic outcome were closely associated with the initial pressure needed to correct the deformity (ie, the stiffness of the carinatum defect). Patients requiring pressures lower than 2.5 pounds per square inch to correct the deformity at the initial assessment completed treatment rapidly, in an average of five months, and had good cosmetic outcomes based on a subjective assessment by clinician and family. Patients requiring compression force higher than five pounds per square inch required a longer period of bracing, averaging 12 months treatment, and were less likely to have good cosmetic outcomes. </p><p>Complications of bracing are minimal. There are some reported problems with mild skin erythema, but skin breakdown is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/6,10,35,36,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10,35,36,40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery is the usual treatment for patients with pectus carinatum who have moderate to severe defects, whose chests are not flexible, or who have pectus carinatum combined with pectus excavatum. It is also used when bracing has not been effective, either due to poor compliance with the bracing protocol or poor patient selection. The techniques used are similar to those used to repair pectus excavatum deformities.

This technique has also been applied to pectus carinatum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/34,47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,47,48</a>]. The patients in these series had either symmetric or asymmetric chondrogladiolar pectus carinatum, and their chest walls were flexible enough that the defects could be manually corrected by moderate compression on the initial physical exam [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The bar was removed between 12 and 24 months after insertion, and 14 of 20 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>] and 13 of 14 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>] had good or excellent results. Complications were minimal, with the most frequent being adherence to the skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Timing of referral and intervention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest referral to a pediatric surgeon as soon as pectus carinatum becomes apparent. The timing of bracing or surgical intervention depends on the age of the child and the severity and progression of the deformity. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the minority of patients who present before puberty, the surgeon provides education and monitoring. Children presenting between 5 and 10 years of age are often good candidates for bracing, because their chest wall is compliant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the majority of patients, who present during the pubertal growth spurt, the surgeon can offer a trial of bracing or surgical repair, depending on the patient's characteristics and preferences. </p><p/><p>Opinions vary on the optimal age for surgery. In general, we recommend surgical repair toward the end of the pubertal growth spurt, typically around 13 to 16 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. This timing takes advantage of the ease of remolding an immature chest wall while minimizing the time that the defect can recur with future growth. Good to excellent surgical results have also been achieved in adult patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Repair in prepubertal children may be associated with development of asphyxiating chondrodystrophy if extensive resection of the costal cartilages is performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. Repair in patients with Marfan syndrome is usually delayed until skeletal maturity is attained, because recurrence is more likely with earlier repair. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Outcome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cosmetic outcomes after surgery, reported using subjective criteria, are good to excellent in more than 90 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/31,41,52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,41,52,53</a>]. Recurrence is uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>], and when it does occur, it is most often in patients who had surgical correction before their growth spurt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Continued surveillance should be maintained for scoliosis. It is not known if correction of the deformity affects the incidence of scoliosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pectus carinatum is an uncommon deformity of the chest wall characterized by protrusion of the sternum. In the majority of cases, the middle and lower portions of the sternum protrude, and the defect is symmetrical. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In more than 90 percent of patients, pectus carinatum deformity is first noted during early adolescence, and it often worsens dramatically during the adolescent growth spurt. The defect does not resolve spontaneously. The vast majority of patients have no physiologic symptoms, and cosmetic appearance is the primary concern. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A minority of patients with pectus carinatum have associated spinal abnormalities, such as scoliosis. It is more common in patients with Marfan and Noonan syndromes, as well as a few other syndromes. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Associated abnormalities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evaluation of a patient with pectus carinatum should include chest radiographs to establish the severity of the deformity and to detect scoliosis. In our practice, we reserve the use of CT to evaluate patients who are being prepared for surgical repair. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Chest imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pectus carinatum is primarily a cosmetic concern. The decision of whether to treat depends on the severity of the defect, and the patient and family's level of concern. Both bracing and surgery provide safe and effective treatment. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest bracing as the initial approach for patients with mild to moderate pectus carinatum defects (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Success is more likely in patients who have flexible chest walls, and in those who are willing to adhere to strict bracing regimens. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Bracing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest surgery as the initial approach for patients with severe pectus carinatum and for those who are skeletally mature (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). It is also an appropriate technique for patients with less severe pectus carinatum who are unwilling to adhere to bracing regimens, provided that they have entered their pubertal growth spurt. We do not recommend surgery for patients who have not entered their pubertal growth spurt. This is because of the small but definite risk of asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy in younger patients who undergo a modified Ravitch pectus carinatum repair. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-carinatum/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Lam CR, Taber RE.
