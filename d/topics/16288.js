Abscesses that are enclosed within the bony confines of the skull or spinal column can expand to compress the brain or spinal cord and cause severe symptoms, permanent complications, or even death. Prompt diagnosis and proper treatment can avert complications and achieve cure in many cases. Both the diagnosis and management of epidural abscess, which often includes a surgical procedure for aspiration or drainage of the abscess, have been greatly aided by the advent of modern imaging techniques, such as computed tomography (CT) and especially magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p>Two distinct varieties of epidural abscess occur: spinal epidural abscess (SEA) and intracranial epidural abscess (IEA). SEA is more common by a factor of nine to one. The distinction between these two entities is based upon the different anatomy of the two locations within the CNS and some differences in symptoms and natural history. SEA and IEA require prompt recognition and proper management to avoid potentially disastrous complications. However, clinical recognition of these entities is often challenging, and treatment discussions can be complex.</p><p>The epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of SEA will be reviewed here. Intracranial epidural abscess, brain abscess, and bacterial meningitis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intracranial-epidural-abscess\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intracranial epidural abscess&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-abscess\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of brain abscess&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-bacterial-brain-abscess\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of bacterial brain abscess&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of bacterial meningitis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-pathophysiology-of-bacterial-meningitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and pathophysiology of bacterial meningitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-therapy-and-prognosis-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial therapy and prognosis of bacterial meningitis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-bacterial-meningitis-caused-by-specific-pathogens-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of bacterial meningitis caused by specific pathogens in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurologic complications of bacterial meningitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The epidural space is the area between the dura mater and the vertebral wall. The anatomy of the spinal canal and dura mater determines many features of epidural abscesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. For example, the dura is adherent to the bone above the foramen magnum. In contrast, an actual or true epidural space exists below the foramen magnum posterior and lateral to the spinal cord that extends down the length of the spinal canal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F51884\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51884 \">figure 1</a>). This space is small in the cervical region and larger in the sacral region. The epidural space contains fat as well as arteries and a venous plexus. Spinal epidural abscesses (SEAs) are most common in the thoracolumbar areas, where the epidural space is larger and contains more infection-prone fat tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/1,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,6</a>].</p><p>The majority of SEAs are located posteriorly; when anterior SEAs occur, they are usually below L1. Because the epidural space is a vertical sheath, abscesses that begin at one level commonly extend to multiple levels.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bacteria can gain access to the epidural space hematogenously, by direct extension from infected contiguous tissue (such as a vertebral body or psoas muscle), or via direct inoculation into the spinal canal (eg, during spinal or epidural anesthetic procedures or surgery).</p><p>Many spinal epidural abscesses (SEAs) begin as a focal pyogenic infection involving the vertebral disc or the junction between the disc and the vertebral body (pyogenic infectious discitis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F51884\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51884 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>As the pyogenic inflammation progresses and the abscess extends longitudinally in the epidural space, damage to the spinal cord can be caused by one or more of the following mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Direct compression</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thrombosis and thrombophlebitis of nearby veins</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interruption of the arterial blood supply</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bacterial toxins and mediators of inflammation</p><p/><p>Longitudinal extension is common when infection arises in the epidural space. The average extent is three to five spinal cord segments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], but the whole length of the spinal column may be involved. However, even a small SEA can cause severe neurologic symptoms and sequelae.</p><p>Epidural abscesses occur uncommonly at noncontiguous locations in the spine. In a retrospective study at an academic tertiary care hospital, 22 of 233 adult patients (9 percent) with SEAs had at least two lesions in different anatomic regions of the spine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Patients with a delay in presentation (defined as the presence of symptoms for seven days or longer), a concomitant area of infection outside the spine or paraspinal region, and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate &ge;95 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/hour</span> at presentation were more likely to have multifocal noncontiguous SEAs. The probability of the presence of a skip lesion was 73 percent for patients with all three predictors, 13 percent with two predictors, 2 percent with one predictor, and 0 percent with zero predictors. The utility of this predictive model in non-referral community settings is unknown.</p><p>Epidural abscesses may contain frank pus, especially in acute cases, but it is quite common to find only granulation tissue at the time of surgical drainage. Granulation tissue is often present when abscesses have been present for more than two weeks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although spinal epidural abscess (SEA) is an uncommon disease, there is evidence that the incidence may have increased over the last several decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Part of this increase may relate to the fact that the sensitivity and accuracy of diagnosis have been improved by the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The increasing incidence of SEA may also relate to the aging of the United States' population and increases in the number of patients undergoing invasive spinal procedures for anesthesia or pain control.</p><p>A population-based study evaluated the incidence of spontaneous epidural abscess. During the period 1990 to 2000, the incidence in a county in Minnesota was 0.88 <span class=\"nowrap\">case/100,000</span> person-years (95% CI 0.27-1.48) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In another report, 64 of 167 patients (38 percent) with hematogenous vertebral osteomyelitis due to methicillin-susceptible <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (MSSA) or gram-negative bacilli had radiographic evidence of an epidural abscess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The incidence of epidural abscess was significantly higher in patients infected with MSSA than in those infected with gram-negative bacilli (47 versus 29 percent).</p><p>Epidural catheter placement is an important risk factor for SEA. The reported incidence of epidural abscesses following placement of epidural catheters has ranged from 0.5 to 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>]. Reports that cite lower complication rates have not described the methods used for serial follow-up of patients undergoing this procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The risk of SEA is substantially lower when catheters are placed for short time periods, as occurs in obstetrical anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In a review of 506,000 pregnant women undergoing epidural catheter placement in 203 obstetric units in the United Kingdom, only one SEA occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Paraspinal injections of glucocorticoids or analgesics can also be complicated by the subsequent development of an epidural abscess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Other possible risk factors for SEA include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes mellitus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alcoholism</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HIV infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trauma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tattooing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acupuncture</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contiguous bony or soft tissue infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bacteremia, secondary to distant infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravenous drug abuse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodialysis</p><p/><p>The median age of onset of SEA is approximately 50 years, and the prevalence appears to be greatest between age 50 and 70 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], but SEA can occur at any age. The incidence has been higher in males in some studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The leading bacterial pathogen causing spinal epidural abscess (SEA) is <em>S. aureus</em>, which accounts for about two-thirds of cases caused by pyogenic bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/1,2,4,5,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,4,5,24</a>]. Various other bacteria can also produce the infection. The approximate frequency of the leading causes of SEA (excluding mycobacteria) is as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/1,2,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>S. aureus</em> &ndash; 63 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gram-negative bacilli &ndash; 16 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Streptococci &ndash; 9 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coagulase-negative staphylococci &ndash; 3 percent, mostly occurring in patients with prior spinal instrumentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anaerobes &ndash; 2 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Others (eg, fungi, parasites) &ndash; 1 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unknown &ndash; 6 percent</p><p/><p><em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> is a more frequent cause of epidural abscesses in parts of the developing world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skeletal-tuberculosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skeletal tuberculosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The proportion of <em>S. aureus</em> infections that are methicillin-resistant (MRSA) varies at different institutions. At one institution, MRSA comprised 40 percent of all <em>S. aureus</em> SEAs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In another case series, 21 of 31 patients with staphylococcal epidural abscesses were infected with MRSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PORTALS OF ENTRY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately one-third of patients with SEA have no identifiable source for the infection. Among the two-thirds for whom a portal of entry can be identified, the most common sites of origin are infections of skin and soft tissues and complications of spinal surgery or other invasive procedures, including epidural catheters that are left in place, usually for pain control (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F51340\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51340 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>SEA from epidural catheters can result from contamination at the time the catheter is inserted, by ascending contamination of the catheter from normal skin flora following catheter insertion, from injection using contaminated syringes or local anesthetic solutions, or by hematogenous seeding from a bacteremia that occurs while the catheter is in place [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>The importance of infection control measures to prevent epidural abscesses associated with epidural catheters was illustrated by a report in which the infecting organism was subsequently isolated from nasal swabs taken from the physician who placed the catheter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. This finding has prompted the recommendation to use face masks when epidural catheters are placed. Safe injection practices must also be used during spinal injection procedures in order to prevent bacterial contamination of medication vials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Injection drug abuse is also an important predisposing factor particularly in communities and locations where intravenous drug use is common.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial manifestations of spinal epidural abscess (SEA) are often nonspecific and include such signs and symptoms as fever and malaise. The classical diagnostic triad consists of fever, spinal pain, and neurologic deficits. However, only a small proportion of patients have all three components at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/26,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,30,31</a>]. Fever may be absent in some patients, leading to delayed or missed diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In fact, most patients present to healthcare providers multiple times before the diagnosis is made.</p><p>Over time, however, an untreated abscess causes symptoms that progress in a typical sequence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Back pain, which is often focal and severe, then</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nerve root pain, described as &quot;shooting&quot; or &quot;electric shocks&quot; in the distribution of the affected nerve root, then</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Motor weakness, sensory changes, and bladder or bowel dysfunction, and then</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paralysis</p><p/><p>Once paralysis develops, it may quickly become irreversible. Thus, urgent intervention may be required if progression of weakness or other neurologic findings are detected. (See <a href=\"#H3640212263\" class=\"local\">'Approach to therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H739704510\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine laboratory studies are seldom helpful in the diagnosis of spinal epidural abscess (SEA). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is usually elevated in both SEA and vertebral osteomyelitis, the hematocrit is usually normal, and the leukocyte count may be elevated or normal. In the emergency department patient population described above, only 60 percent of patients who were diagnosed with SEA had leukocytosis at their initial visit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In another prospective study, the ESR was elevated (&gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/hour)</span> in all 86 patients with SEA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In contrast, only 33 percent of non-SEA patients had ESR elevations. The mean ESR in patients with SEA was significantly elevated (76.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/hour)</span>.</p><p>In another report, the ESR was elevated in 110 of 117 patients (94 percent) with SEA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The utility of C-reactive protein (CRP) in patients with SEA in this series was less striking: 87 percent of patients with SEA had elevated CRP levels as compared with 50 percent of patients with spine pain not due to an SEA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thinking of spinal epidural abscess (SEA) is the key to diagnosis. SEA is a rare cause of back pain, even though most patients with SEA have back pain. Thus, it is not surprising that the diagnosis is infrequently made, or even considered, when patients with this condition first seek medical care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H739704780\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the diagnosis of SEA is seriously considered, imaging of the spinal column is imperative. If the suspicion for SEA is high, the appropriate medical team and surgical team (neurosurgery or orthopedic spine surgery) should be notified as soon as imaging findings reveal findings consistent with an SEA.</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred test because it is often positive early in the course of the infection and provides the best visualization of the location and extent of inflammatory changes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F68878\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68878 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/24,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,34</a>]. Once the diagnosis of SEA is suspected, MRI with contrast (eg, gadolinium) should be performed as soon as possible. Consideration should be given to imaging the entire spinal column even when patients have focal signs or symptoms in one region because multiple skip lesions are common and patients may not have pain or tenderness in all of the affected areas. Some patients have difficulty lying flat and still for an MRI due to spinal pain; pain management including even conscious sedation may be required for such patients. If gadolinium cannot be used (eg, in patients with renal insufficiency), the presence of paraspinal and bone marrow edema are the most common findings in patients with SEA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Distinguishing epidural soft tissue edema from epidural abscess is important. This distinction is primarily made by MRI, although the presence or absence of typical neurologic symptoms is also useful. Abscesses visualized by MRI usually demonstrate fluid-equivalent signal intensity on T2-weighted images with rim enhancement and a hypointense center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/13,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,36</a>]. In contrast, soft tissue edema usually manifests as diffuse hypointensity of T1-weighted images, hyperintensity on T2-weighted images, and contrast enhancement. Some SEAs are associated with ring-like enhancement or linear dural enhancement that some experts have suggested may be important indicators of the need for surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Additional study is necessary to determine whether this is the case.</p><p>Computed tomography (CT) scanning with intravenous contrast is an acceptable alternative to MRI if MRI is not immediately available or if it is contraindicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/5,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,39</a>]. Plain radiographs of the spine may reveal changes of osteomyelitis or discitis but are rarely diagnostic of SEA. Myelography is now largely obsolete.</p><p>Once an intraspinal mass that could be an SEA has been identified, it is important to try to isolate the etiologic organism from samples of blood and abscess contents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The approximate frequency of positive cultures from various sources in SEA is [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abscess contents &ndash; 90 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood &ndash; 62 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) &ndash; 19 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]</p><p/><p>Two sets of blood cultures should be drawn in all patients with suspected SEA. The best specimen for culture is fluid or pus of the epidural abscess or inflammatory mass obtained by direct needle aspiration, usually using CT guidance.</p><p>Lumbar puncture for CSF examination is often not performed because the diagnostic yield is low and because of the risk of introducing infection into the central nervous system if the needle goes through an affected area. In most cases, the CSF findings are limited to a nonspecific elevation of protein and pleocytosis. CSF Gram stain is usually negative, and cultures are rarely positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/5,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H739704786\"><span class=\"h2\">Challenges in diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, the diagnosis of SEA is infrequently made, or even considered, when patients first seek medical care, and most patients present to healthcare providers multiple times before the diagnosis is made. A minority of patients with SEA in three case series had the classic triad of fever, spinal pain, and neurologic deficits at the time they initially sought medical care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/26,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,30,31</a>].</p><p>Fever was the most likely classic finding to be absent in these case series; as an example, only 23 of 48 patients (48 percent) were febrile in one case series reported from a single tertiary care center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. However, fever is an important diagnostic clue when it is present. It is important to note that fever is not typically present in most patients with herniated discs or other causes of musculoskeletal back pain. Fever in a patient with severe, localized back pain, especially if the pain is worsened by palpation or percussion, should suggest the diagnosis of SEA or vertebral osteomyelitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vertebral-osteomyelitis-and-discitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vertebral osteomyelitis and discitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The difficulty in establishing the diagnosis of SEA was investigated in a study of 63 patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The mean duration of symptoms between onset and the first ED visit or admission was five and nine days, respectively, and the median number of ED visits before admission was two (range one to eight).

The decision guideline included a risk factor assessment for all patients initially lacking neurologic deficits, followed by erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein measurements prior to obtaining imaging studies. The risk factor assessment included obtaining information about the following factors: diabetes, history of intravenous drug use, chronic liver or kidney disease, recent spine procedures, spine surgery or fractures, indwelling vascular catheters, other site of infection, or an immunocompromising condition. Diagnostic delay was defined as multiple visits to the ED or admission to a nonsurgical service without a diagnosis of SEA. Diagnostic delays were observed in 46 of 55 patients (84 percent) during a nine-year period prior to the institution of this decision guideline, compared with 3 of 31 patients (10 percent) during the five-year period following the use of the above decision guideline.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of spinal epidural abscess (SEA) is extensive because many conditions cause back pain and neurologic deficits.

Surgical decompression and drainage with systemic antibiotic therapy is the treatment of choice for many patients and particularly for those with acute or progressive neurologic deficits, spinal instability, ring-enhancing lesions on MRI, or disease progression on antibiotic therapy. However, there are several situations in which medical therapy alone may be selected in patients with documented epidural abscesses. Some patients may elect a nonsurgical approach due to underlying medical conditions (eg, advanced malignancy, clinical instability); others may have advanced neurologic deficits of more than 48 hours duration that are deemed unlikely to improve with surgery.</p><p>There are a number of reports documenting recovery in patients with epidural abscesses following simple aspiration (for diagnosis) and the use of antibiotic therapy without surgical decompression. In most of these cases, the abscess was either not associated with any neurologic deficit or accompanied by minor weakness at the time of diagnosis and initiation of treatment.</p><p>No randomized trials of medical (or conservative) versus surgical management of SEA exist nor are they likely to be done in the future. Thus, analyses of retrospective single-center case series, case reports, and case series with historical controls are the basis for much of the scientific literature on this topic. Many of these retrospective studies were subject to selection (allocation) biases with cohorts of patients treated medically having smaller abscesses and better initial neurologic function than patients treated surgically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Also, unsuccessful attempts at medical therapy are less likely to be reported in the literature, leading to publication bias. Additionally, patients treated medically in most case series were selected by imprecise criteria, and they were heterogeneous in terms of their underlying medical problems. Thus, caution should be used in interpreting data such as those cited below.</p><p>One retrospective study involving 128 patients reported a failure rate of 41 percent in patients initially treated medically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Diabetes, C-reactive protein level &gt;115 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L,</span> white blood cell count &gt;12,500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/L,</span> and bacteremia were predictive of failure of medical therapy, which in this and most other studies was defined as a physician-documented decline in motor status while on intravenous antibiotics. Other studies have shown failure rates of medical therapy ranging from 43 to 75 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/31,43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,43,44</a>]. These studies also suggested that other factors such as infection due to methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and age &gt;65 years are additional risk factors for failure of medical therapy. It is important to note that several studies have shown medical therapy failure rates between 8.5 and 17 percent even in &quot;ideal&quot; patients who lacked the above risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].</p><p>We use a medical (conservative) approach only in highly selected patients (eg, those lacking risk factors such as advanced age, bacteremia, white blood cell counts &gt;12,500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cell/L,</span> diabetes, and methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus </em>[MRSA] infection) in whom the organism is known from aspiration and in whom there is no neurologic deficit. Medical therapy may also be appropriate in the rare patient who refuses surgery, is medically unstable, and thus is deemed to have an unacceptable surgical risk or in patients who have had a complete spinal cord injury from the SEA for greater than 48 hours and lack evidence of an ascending spinal lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/23,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,38</a>].

We favor not waiting to start antibiotics for a specimen to be collected from the SEA (eg, abscess fluid) since waiting for a surgical intervention often results in a delay in initiating appropriate antimicrobial therapy. In most cases, an imaging study (ideally magnetic resonance imaging) can be obtained quickly and confirms the diagnosis of SEA, leading the clinician to start antibiotics and consider surgical intervention. If an imaging study is not immediately available and the suspicion for SEA is high, it is reasonable to start antibiotics while awaiting the imaging study. Nevertheless, an imaging study should still be obtained as early as possible since it will help to guide the need for surgical intervention, which is a critical part of management. (See <a href=\"#H739704780\" class=\"local\">'Approach to diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3640212263\" class=\"local\">'Approach to therapy'</a> above.)</p><p>There are no randomized controlled trials evaluating antibiotic regimens for the treatment of spinal epidural abscess. Initial treatment regimens are usually empiric and designed to target the most common pathogens. An empiric regimen with antibiotics active against staphylococci, streptococci, and gram-negative bacilli should be chosen.

However, there is not strong evidence to support this, and we generally favor the simpler approach suggested above.

In the population of emergency department (ED) patients described above, 23 of 63 patients (37 percent) with an SEA had residual motor weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-epidural-abscess/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Abscesses that are enclosed within the bony confines of the skull or spinal column can expand to compress the brain or spinal cord and cause severe symptoms, permanent complications, or even death. Prompt diagnosis and proper treatment can avert complications and achieve cure in many cases. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bacteria can gain access to the epidural space hematogenously, by direct extension from infected contiguous tissue (such as a vertebral body or psoas muscle), or via direct inoculation into the spinal canal (eg, during spinal or epidural anesthetic procedures or surgery). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors for spinal epidural abscesses (SEAs) include epidural catheters, diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, HIV infection, bacteremia, and intravenous drug abuse. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> is responsible for two-thirds of cases caused by pyogenic bacteria; less common causes include gram-negative bacilli, coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococci, and anaerobes. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately one-third of patients with SEA have no identifiable source for the infection. Among the two-thirds for whom a portal of entry can be identified, the most common sites of origin are infections of skin and soft tissues and complications of spinal surgery or other invasive procedures, including epidural catheters that are left in place, usually for pain control (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F51340\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51340 \">table 1</a>). Injection drug abuse is also an important predisposing factor. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Portals of entry'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial manifestations of SEA can be nonspecific, such as fever and malaise. The classical diagnostic triad consists of fever, spinal pain, and neurologic deficits. However, only a few patients have all three components at presentation. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thinking of SEA is the key to diagnosis. SEA is a rare cause of back pain. Thus, it is not surprising that the diagnosis is infrequently made, or even considered, when patients with this condition first seek medical care. Once the diagnosis of SEA is seriously considered, imaging of the spinal column is imperative. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast (eg, gadolinium) is the preferred test because it is often positive early in the course of the infection and provides the best imaging of the location and extent of inflammatory changes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F68878\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68878 \">image 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once an intraspinal mass that could be an SEA has been located, it is important to try to isolate the etiologic organism from samples of blood, abscess contents, or cerebrospinal fluid. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The two principles of optimal therapy of an SEA are:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Reduction in size and ultimate elimination of the inflammatory mass</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Eradication of the causative organism</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">These goals are usually accomplished by a combination of aspiration, drainage, and antibiotic therapy. In most cases, early surgical decompression and drainage is the critical factor that will improve the ultimate prognosis. (See <a href=\"#H3640212263\" class=\"local\">'Approach to therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We use a conservative (nonsurgical) approach in selected patients in whom the organism is known from blood cultures <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> aspiration and in whom there is no neurologic deficit. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Medical plus surgical therapy versus medical therapy alone'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two sets of blood cultures should be obtained before starting antibiotics. We recommend that antibiotics be started as soon as the diagnosis of SEA is strongly suspected rather than waiting to collect a surgical specimen from the SEA (eg, abscess fluid) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). The empiric antibiotic regimen should have activity against staphylococci, streptococci, and gram-negative bacilli.
