It may help to review some facts about the condition. More detailed information is available separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=down-syndrome-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Down syndrome (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Down syndrome is caused by an extra number 21 chromosome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The condition occurs in about 1 in 600 births and is more common earlier in pregnancy, with about 1 in 450 pregnancies affected in the late first trimester.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People with Down syndrome have mild to moderate intellectual disability (mental retardation), meaning that the person can often do things independently; however, most need supervision throughout their lives.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People with Down syndrome have characteristic facial features, meaning that their facial features are often similar to those of other people with Down syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People with Down syndrome may have birth defects, such as problems with how the heart or intestines develop. Other medical problems can also develop.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The average lifespan for an individual with Down syndrome is about 50 to 60 years.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Could my baby have Down syndrome?</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A woman of any age can have a baby with Down syndrome, but the chance gets higher as a woman gets older.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Down syndrome usually does not run in families, but you should inform your doctor or nurse if you or your partner has a family member with Down syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">WHAT INFORMATION DOES A PRENATAL SCREENING TEST FOR DOWN SYNDROME PROVIDE?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A screening test will tell you the chances of having a certain medical condition.</p><p>Screening tests for Down syndrome cannot tell for certain whether your baby actually has Down syndrome; rather, they tell you whether there is a low or high risk that the baby is affected. By comparison, a diagnostic test can tell for certain if the baby has Down syndrome.</p><p>The available tests may also identify if your pregnancy is at increased risk for certain other chromosome problems. Some of these chromosome problems are trisomy 18 and trisomy 13, which are more life-threatening than Down syndrome, or sex chromosome abnormalities, which are associated with more mild intellectual disabilities. </p><p>The advantage of screening tests is that they only require a blood sample from the mother, and possibly an ultrasound, so there is no risk of losing the pregnancy. The diagnostic tests for Down syndrome and other chromosome problems require putting a needle into the uterus or placenta and removing some fluid or tissue. There is a small risk of miscarriage (about <span class=\"nowrap\">1/200</span> for chorionic villus sampling [CVS] and <span class=\"nowrap\">1/300</span> to <span class=\"nowrap\">1/600</span> for amniocentesis) after a diagnostic test.</p><p>The decision to have a prenatal screening test for Down syndrome is yours and depends upon your wishes, values, and beliefs. There is no right or wrong choice; you decide what is best for you and your family. Some couples who have a positive test decide against having a confirmatory diagnostic test and some decide to continue the pregnancy even when Down syndrome is diagnosed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">WHO IS OFFERED A SCREENING TEST FOR DOWN SYNDROME?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that <strong>all</strong> pregnant women, regardless of age, be offered the opportunity to have a screening test for Down syndrome before 20 weeks of pregnancy. Screening tests for Down syndrome are voluntary, meaning that it is your choice whether to have or not have these tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DECIDING TO HAVE A SCREENING TEST FOR DOWN SYNDROME</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Why should I have a screening test?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These are some of the reasons that women choose to have screening for Down syndrome:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>I want as much information as possible during pregnancy about the health of my developing baby.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If my baby has Down syndrome, I want to know while I am pregnant so I can learn as much as possible about the condition before the baby is born.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>I am planning to deliver my baby in a community hospital, so if my baby has serious birth defects associated with Down syndrome (eg, heart or intestinal abnormalities), I would rather deliver at a hospital with a special care nursery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>I have been anxious since I learned I was pregnant and if I find out that my baby's risk of having Down syndrome is low, I believe it will help ease my anxiety.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>I want to consider all of my options. If my developing baby has Down syndrome, I would want the option to terminate the pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>I am not sure what I would do, or how I would feel, if my baby has Down syndrome. I am going to take it one step at a time. If my screening test comes back saying I am at increased risk, I will decide at that time if I want to have more testing.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Why might I choose not to have a screening test?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These are some of the reasons that a woman might choose NOT to have screening:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>I have decided that &quot;whatever will be, will be,&quot; and I will wait until the baby's birth to find out if the baby is healthy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>I do not want to be faced with decisions about my unborn baby. Because of religious or personal beliefs, I would never consider terminating an affected pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because I am certain I would never have a diagnostic test, even with only a small risk of a miscarriage, I do not want to have a screening test.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>I want to know for sure if the developing baby has Down syndrome, so I am having a diagnostic test (eg, chorionic villus sampling [CVS] or amniocentesis) rather than a screening test. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chorionic-villus-sampling-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Chorionic villus sampling (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amniocentesis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Amniocentesis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Some common myths about screening for Down syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some of the reasons women decide whether or not to have screening are based on incorrect information, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myth &ndash; My baby won't have Down syndrome because I am young, I exercise, and I am healthy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fact &ndash; A woman of any age can have a baby with Down syndrome, regardless of her health.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myth &ndash; My baby won't have Down syndrome because I do not drink or smoke.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fact &ndash; Avoiding alcohol or tobacco during pregnancy is very important for the health of you and your baby; however, it does <strong>not</strong> affect the chance that your baby will have Down syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myth &ndash; My baby won't have Down syndrome because no one in my family or the father of the baby's family has Down syndrome.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fact &ndash; Down syndrome usually does not run in families. Your baby can be affected even if there is no one else in the family with Down syndrome. If you have a family history of Down syndrome, you should talk to your doctor, nurse, or a genetic counselor to discuss if it will increase your risk of having a baby with Down syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myth &ndash; I should not have screening for Down syndrome unless I know that I would terminate the pregnancy if Down syndrome were detected.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fact &ndash; Many people who would not terminate their pregnancy choose to have screening. These people want information about their unborn baby's health before birth to plan for delivery and newborn care.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myth &ndash; My friend told me that if I have a screening test, it will come back &quot;positive&quot; since most people who have the test end up with a &quot;positive&quot; result.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fact &ndash; Most people who have a screening test will have a &quot;negative&quot; result, meaning that the baby has a low risk of having Down syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">WHAT DOWN SYNDROME SCREENING TESTS ARE AVAILABLE?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several different screening tests available. Some important considerations include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How far along in pregnancy are you?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What screening tests are available in your area?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What, if any, diagnostic tests (chorionic villus sampling [CVS] or amniocentesis) are available in your area?</p><p/><p>There are four basic types of screening tests for Down syndrome. Some of these tests need to be done early in the pregnancy, while one is not done until 15 to 18 weeks of pregnancy (at around 4 months).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First-trimester screening is typically done at 11 to 13 weeks of pregnancy. It involves a test of your blood and an ultrasound of the developing baby.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Second-trimester screening is typically done at 15 to 18 weeks of pregnancy. The test only requires a sample of your blood.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Integrated screening combines results from tests done during the first and second trimesters. These tests involve two samples of your blood, and often include an ultrasound of the developing baby. Results are usually available in the second trimester. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The newest screening method is the measurement of circulating cell-free DNA in maternal plasma, which can be done beginning at 10 weeks of pregnancy.&nbsp;This test only requires a sample of your blood. It is not recommended for women with twins or triplets and it cannot provide a result in a small number of women (1 to 5 percent).</p><p/><p>Cell-free DNA screening may not be paid for by your health insurance if you are not at an increased risk of a chromosome problem before having the test. &#160;Women at high risk are those of advanced maternal age or with a pregnancy history of chromosome problems, or women who have had a previous positive screening test.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Which screening test should I choose?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The &quot;best&quot; screening test depends upon your values and preferences. You can use the following statements to help guide your decision (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F66116\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66116 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">TEST RESULTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most tests, the results will be given as a number:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screen negative (low risk): For example, a woman with a result of 1 in 2000 would have a &quot;low&quot; risk that the baby is affected. The 1 in 2000 means that if 2000 women had this same risk, only 1 of them (0.05 percent) would actually have a developing baby with Down syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screen positive (high risk): A woman with a result of 1 in 50 would be considered at &quot;high&quot; risk. The 1 in 50 means that, among 50 women with this same risk, 1 of them (2 percent) would have a developing baby with Down syndrome.</p><p/><p>There is no screening result that will tell for sure if the developing baby definitely does or does not have Down syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Screen positive results</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your test shows a &quot;high&quot; risk of having a baby with Down syndrome, your options are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A diagnostic procedure, if you want to know for sure if your baby is affected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you had one of the standard serum screening tests, you can have a cell free DNA-based test for secondary screening. This test provides a more reliable risk estimate than standard serum screening tests, often enabling women with a positive standard serum screen to avoid a diagnostic procedure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F103160\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef103160 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No further testing during pregnancy. If needed, the infant can be tested after birth.</p><p/><p>To help you with your decision, consider meeting with a genetic counselor. He or she can help you balance the risks and benefits of diagnostic testing and explore your feelings about raising a child with Down syndrome.</p><p>Two diagnostic procedures are available that can tell you for certain if your baby has a chromosome problem:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) &ndash; CVS is the test that would be done if you were in the first trimester of pregnancy. The test is performed between 10 and 13 weeks of pregnancy and has a small risk of miscarriage (about 1 miscarriage for every 100 procedures). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chorionic-villus-sampling-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Chorionic villus sampling (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amniocentesis &ndash; Amniocentesis is the test that would be done if you were in your second trimester (after 14 weeks of pregnancy). Amniocentesis is thought to have a smaller risk of miscarriage (less than 1 miscarriage for every 200 procedures) compared with CVS.
