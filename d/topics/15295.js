In a prospective study of 38 children with roseola, human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) viremia was detected in all of the children during the first two days of illness (before the onset of the rash) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/roseola-infantum-exanthem-subitum/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. By days 5 to 7, only 7 percent of children were viremic. HHV-6 antibody was first detected on day 3 of illness and present in all patients by day 8 of illness. This pattern of viremia preceding rash, and rash coincident with development of antibody, suggests that the rash may result from antigen-antibody complexes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/roseola-infantum-exanthem-subitum/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSMISSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most cases of roseola occur sporadically, without known exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/roseola-infantum-exanthem-subitum/abstract/2,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,7</a>].

Transmission of human herpesvirus 6, the most common cause, probably results from asymptomatic shedding of virus in secretions of close contacts, which is difficult to prevent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/roseola-infantum-exanthem-subitum/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The other viruses that cause roseola typically are spread through respiratory secretions or the fecal-oral route. Simple hygienic measures, such as handwashing, may help to prevent spread.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

Other causes include HHV-7, enteroviruses, adenovirus, and parainfluenza virus type 1. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Roseola is an illness of young children, with a peak prevalence between 7 and 13 months. It occurs throughout the year. Most cases occur sporadically without known exposure. (See <a href=\"#H1963384803\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiologic features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Roseola classically begins with three to five days of fever that may exceed 40&deg;C (104&deg;F); as the fever abates, a blanching macular or maculopapular rash develops, starting on the neck and trunk and spreading to the face and extremities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81967\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81967 \">picture 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical course'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory investigation is seldom necessary for patients with classic roseola. However, it may be undertaken in children with atypical features or as part of the evaluation of fever. Laboratory features of roseola include relative neutropenia and mild atypical lymphocytosis. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Roseola is diagnosed clinically based on the characteristic features: fever for three to five days followed by abrupt defervescence and development of a rash in a young child (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81967\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81967 \">picture 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of roseola includes several other infectious exanthems and drug allergy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F104587\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104587 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Roseola is usually a benign self-limited disease. Treatment is supportive (eg, control of fever if it is associated with discomfort). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Standard hygienic measures, such as handwashing, may help to prevent spread of the viral pathogens that cause roseola. There is no recommended period of exclusion from out-of-home child care for children with roseola.
