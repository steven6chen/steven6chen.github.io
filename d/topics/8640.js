During &quot;attacks&quot; of ISCLS, profound derangements of the vascular endothelium develop, resulting in leakage of plasma and proteins into the interstitial compartment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-systemic-capillary-leak-syndrome/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Episodes vary in severity and frequency and may be fatal. ISCLS was first described by Clarkson in 1960 and is variably referred to as Clarkson's disease or syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-systemic-capillary-leak-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 150 cases of idiopathic systemic capillary leak syndrome (ISCLS) have been reported worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-systemic-capillary-leak-syndrome/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. These have been diagnosed primarily in middle-aged adults, although cases in children as young as five months old have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-systemic-capillary-leak-syndrome/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. There is no apparent gender predilection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cause(s) of idiopathic systemic capillary leak syndrome (ISCLS) is not known, although there is an associated monoclonal gammopathy in many patients. Several theories of pathogenesis have been proposed and are discussed in this section. It is helpful first to review mechanisms of capillary leakage in other diseases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91451595\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanisms of capillary leakage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vascular endothelium is a semi-permeable barrier that controls the passage of fluid and macromolecules between the intravascular and interstitial spaces. Dysfunction of this barrier leads to leakage, with loss of intravascular fluid and protein into the interstitial compartment. Cells and platelets are generally retained within the vasculature, resulting in elevations in white blood cell, red blood cell, and platelet counts. The resulting intravascular fluid depletion can cause hypotension and impair the delivery of oxygen to the tissues. Severe capillary leakage can result in hypotension and shock.</p><p>There are many known causes of capillary leak, which can be categorized as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased hydrostatic pressure within the capillaries can force fluid and protein through the endothelial barrier and into the interstitium. This is the mechanism of capillary leak in heart failure, renal failure, hepatic venous obstruction (eg, cirrhosis), and lower extremity deep vein thrombosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased capillary oncotic pressure may fail to retain fluid within the vascular space. This is the mechanism of capillary leak in conditions characterized by albumin loss (eg, nephrotic syndrome, protein losing enteropathy) or decreased albumin synthesis (eg, liver disease).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased capillary permeability allows fluid and protein to readily pass through the endothelial barrier and into the interstitium. This is the mechanism of capillary leak in many medical conditions, including sepsis, the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, acute pancreatitis, anaphylaxis, snake bites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-systemic-capillary-leak-syndrome/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>], and certain infectious syndromes (eg, Dengue hemorrhagic fever, brucellosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-systemic-capillary-leak-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-systemic-capillary-leak-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]).

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-edema-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and etiology of edema in adults&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology of edema formation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypotheses in ISCLS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain ISCLS, although the evidence for any one theory is incomplete.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Monoclonal proteins</strong> &ndash; Several studies have found that the majority of patients in series and case reports had a monoclonal gammopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-systemic-capillary-leak-syndrome/abstract/1,14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14-17</a>]. One study noted that plasma levels of paraproteins increased during the acute phase of capillary leak and decreased during remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-systemic-capillary-leak-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-methods-for-analyzing-monoclonal-proteins\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory methods for analyzing monoclonal proteins&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The role of these paraproteins in the pathogenesis of ISCLS has not been determined. Paraproteins are probably not directly responsible for disrupting the vascular endothelial barrier, since studies in which healthy endothelial cells were exposed in vitro to paraproteins from three patients found no detectable cytotoxic effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-systemic-capillary-leak-syndrome/abstract/15,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,19</a>]. It is possible that the paraproteins are an epiphenomenon rather than a pathogenic factor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Abnormalities in VEGF and angiopoietin 2</strong> &ndash; Elevated levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin 2 at baseline, with further elevations during attacks, were noted in a series of 23 patients and in several smaller reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-systemic-capillary-leak-syndrome/abstract/3,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,19,20</a>], although not in others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-systemic-capillary-leak-syndrome/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. The source of these factors in ISCLS is unknown. They have been proposed to disrupt endothelial cell junctions and cause cell retraction, in the absence of apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-systemic-capillary-leak-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. VEGF has been implicated in other disorders, such as sepsis. (See <a href=\"#H7998629\" class=\"local\">'Acute pharmacologic treatments and novel therapies'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Endothelial cell apoptosis</strong> &ndash; Contraction of endothelial cells due to apoptosis (ie, programmed cell death) during attacks of ISCLS has been proposed as a possible mechanism. This hypothesis is supported by histologic changes consistent with endothelial cell apoptosis in muscle biopsies obtained during attacks of ISCLS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-systemic-capillary-leak-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In addition, serum taken from patients with ISCLS mediated extensive apoptosis and contraction of endothelial cells in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-systemic-capillary-leak-syndrome/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Involvement of IL-2</strong> &ndash; The proposal that endogenous interleukin-2 (IL-2) may contribute to the pathogenesis of ISCLS is based upon the observation that patients who receive high-dose recombinant IL-2 therapy can develop a capillary leakage syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-systemic-capillary-leak-syndrome/abstract/6,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,25,26</a>]. In addition, increased IL-2 expression was demonstrated on the perivascular blood mononuclear cells of symptomatic patients with ISCLS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-systemic-capillary-leak-syndrome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inflammatory mediators</strong> &ndash; Several inflammatory mediators have been studied in the pathogenesis of ISCLS, including leukotrienes and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). In contrast, defects in other factors and pathways capable of altering capillary permeability (eg, complement, kinins, prostaglandin, coagulation, histamine, serotonin) have not been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-systemic-capillary-leak-syndrome/abstract/14,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Leukotrienes, chemical mediators produced from arachidonic acid metabolism within leukocytes, may increase capillary permeability in patients with ISCLS. One study found that leukocyte platelet suspensions from patients with ISCLS contained abnormalities of in vitro leukotriene production, compared with normal controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-systemic-capillary-leak-syndrome/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A small series of three patients reported elevations of TNF-alpha during episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-systemic-capillary-leak-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. TNF-alpha is an inflammatory mediator that can increase vascular permeability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-systemic-capillary-leak-syndrome/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. One patient was treated acutely with a TNF-alpha antagonist, with apparent benefit. (See <a href=\"#H7998629\" class=\"local\">'Acute pharmacologic treatments and novel therapies'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Attacks of idiopathic systemic capillary leak syndrome (ISCLS) usually demonstrate three phases: a prodromal phase, an extravasation phase, and a recovery phase. The frequency and severity of attacks varies significantly among patients. Some individuals have a single attack in a lifetime, while others have several per year. In one series of 25 patients, patients experienced a median of three acute attacks per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-systemic-capillary-leak-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Prodromal symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nearly 50 percent report other prodromal symptoms that precede more serious signs by one to two days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-systemic-capillary-leak-syndrome/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Common prodromal symptoms include irritability, fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea, myalgias of the extremities, polydipsia, and a sudden increase in body weight. Approximately 30 percent of patients report an antecedent upper respiratory tract infection (URI) or a flu-like illness with fever. Women may be more prone to attacks during menses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-systemic-capillary-leak-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Sustained physical exertion may also trigger attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-systemic-capillary-leak-syndrome/abstract/4,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Fluid extravasation phase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Capillary leakage develops over one to four days after the prodromal period. As this occurs, the triad of hypotension, hemoconcentration, and hypoalbuminemia develops. Prior to diagnosis, most patients present at this extravasation stage because any prodromal symptoms do not prompt the patient to seek care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-systemic-capillary-leak-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypotension</strong> &ndash; Intravascular hypovolemia causes hypotension, which is generally defined as a systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg, a mean blood pressure &lt;65 mmHg, or a decrease in systolic blood pressure of more than 40 mmHg from baseline. The hypotension can be severe upon presentation. Hypotension develops in nearly all patients and its major consequence is shock, defined as reduced oxygen delivery to the tissues due to systemic hypoperfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-systemic-capillary-leak-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hemoconcentration</strong> &ndash; Severe hemoconcentration is an important diagnostic clue in ISCLS because it distinguishes this disorder from many other causes of shock. In the series of 25 patients, the median hematocrit during attacks was 60.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-systemic-capillary-leak-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Another review reported a mean hematocrit of 64 &plusmn; 9 percent and a mean white blood cell count of 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup></span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-systemic-capillary-leak-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypoalbuminemia</strong> &ndash; Patients with ISCLS had a mean serum albumin of 1.7 &plusmn; 0.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">gm/dL</span> in the same review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-systemic-capillary-leak-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p>Other findings that are caused by capillary leakage include generalized edema, ascites, bilateral pleural effusions, pericardial effusions, and cerebral edema and encephalopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-systemic-capillary-leak-syndrome/abstract/16,24,33-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,24,33-39</a>]. There may also be symptoms and signs related to the hypotension and systemic hypoperfusion. These include cool and vasoconstricted skin, restlessness or obtundation, oliguria or anuria, lactic acidosis, and diminished pulses. Acute right axis deviation may be present on electrocardiogram.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Recovery (fluid recruitment) phase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The extravasation phase resolves after several days and the recovery phase begins. The transition can occur quickly and is characterized by a decrease in the amount of intravenous fluids that are necessary to maintain an adequate intravascular volume.</p><p>During the recovery phase, extravasated fluids are recruited back into the intravascular space. The patient is at high risk for intravascular volume overload and pulmonary edema during this period (even those patients with normal renal function). (See <a href=\"#H4235832\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary edema'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic forms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A small number of reports describe chronic forms of systemic capillary leak syndrome, in which patients present with subacute edema and monoclonal gammopathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-systemic-capillary-leak-syndrome/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>]. In the series of 25 patients mentioned previously, two patients developed what appeared to be a chronic form of the disease, with progressive generalized edema and pleural and pericardial effusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-systemic-capillary-leak-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypotension requires immediate intervention to prevent the complications of prolonged hypoperfusion, and the diagnostic evaluation should take place concurrently with initial management. Resuscitative efforts should not be delayed by the diagnostic evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Stabilization'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91452975\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial assessment is the same as that for hypotension or shock of uncertain etiology. The first step is to try and determine the type of shock, thereby narrowing the differential diagnosis. There are three types of shock: hypovolemic shock, cardiogenic shock, and distributive shock. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-classification-etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-shock-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, classification, etiology, and pathophysiology of shock in adults&quot;, section on 'Classification and etiology'</a>.)</p><p>Idiopathic systemic capillary leak syndrome (ISCLS) is a form of distributive and hypovolemic shock. Distributive shock is initially characterized by warm, flushed skin. The jugular venous pressure and central venous pressure (CVP) may be low due to hypovolemia. As capillary leak persists, patients become hemodynamically unstable. Initial considerations in a patient with possible ISCLS include more common causes of shock complicated by a systemic capillary leak (eg, severe sepsis, septic shock, toxic shock syndrome [TSS], anaphylaxis, and certain drug reactions). ISCLS should be considered in the setting of hemoconcentration and the absence of an identifiable cause of shock. In addition, patients with ISCLS are more likely to <strong>present</strong> with generalized edema, while patients with distributive shock are more likely to develop generalized edema during fluid resuscitation. However, patients with ISCLS can also develop dramatically worsening edema with fluid resuscitation, since a large portion of the intravenous fluids will leak into the interstitial space. The skin frequently becomes cool and clammy during this period as blood is redirected to the core organs. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91452887\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial laboratory studies are the same as those required to evaluate a patient with distributive shock of any cause. </p><p>Once ISCLS is suspected and the patient has been stabilized, serum immunoglobulin levels, a serum protein electrophoresis, and serum free light chains should be obtained to evaluate for a monoclonal gammopathy. A monoclonal gammopathy was reported in the majority of patients in at least two series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-systemic-capillary-leak-syndrome/abstract/4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8</a>]. The paraproteins are most often of the immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) subclass with kappa light chains and are typically identified in the serum, rather than the urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-systemic-capillary-leak-syndrome/abstract/8,15,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,15,43</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Hypotheses in ISCLS'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-methods-for-analyzing-monoclonal-proteins\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory methods for analyzing monoclonal proteins&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20828386\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ISCLS is ultimately a diagnosis of exclusion that is made when a patient presents with one or more episodes of intravascular hypovolemia, generalized edema, and the diagnostic triad (hypotension, hemoconcentration, hypoalbuminemia) in the absence of an identifiable alternative cause. The presence of a monoclonal gammopathy supports the diagnosis, but it is not required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several disorders may mimic idiopathic systemic capillary leak syndrome (ISCLS), including severe sepsis or septic shock, toxic shock syndrome (TSS), anaphylaxis (as part of systemic mastocytosis or in response to a specific allergen), and certain drug reactions. Hereditary angioedema should also be considered since ISCLS occasionally presents with acute cutaneous edema without hypotension.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Severe sepsis or septic shock</strong> &ndash; Sepsis is a clinical syndrome characterized by systemic inflammation due to infection. There is a continuum of severity, ranging from sepsis to severe sepsis and septic shock. Normal levels of serum albumin can help distinguish sepsis from ISCLS. Sepsis is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sepsis-syndromes-in-adults-epidemiology-definitions-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sepsis syndromes in adults: Epidemiology, definitions, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and prognosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-sepsis-and-septic-shock-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of suspected sepsis and septic shock in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Recurrent toxic shock syndrome in women</strong> &ndash; TSS is a rapidly developing toxin-induced illness that usually affects otherwise healthy individuals (typically young women, but children and men are also susceptible). Patients usually have fever, hypotension, and cutaneous findings. The skin changes are variable, ranging from a sunburn-like rash to erythroderma or a maculopapular eruption. Other manifestations include chills, malaise, headache, sore throat, myalgias, fatigue, vomiting, watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, and orthostatic dizziness or syncope. In menstrual cases, symptoms begin within two to three days of the onset of menstruation, and in postsurgical cases, approximately two days after the procedure. The presence of skin findings, a history of antecedent menstruation, or a recent medical procedure is helpful in distinguishing TSS from ISCLS. TSS can be recurrent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-systemic-capillary-leak-syndrome/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anaphylaxis</strong> &ndash; Anaphylaxis is an acute syndrome resulting from the sudden release of mast cell- and basophil-derived mediators into the circulation, usually due to immunologic reactions to foods, medications, and insect stings. If anaphylaxis is suspected, the patient should be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> and fluid resuscitation, and a serum tryptase level should be drawn as soon as possible. Tryptase is found almost exclusively in mast cells and basophils, and is released into the serum when these cells become activated. Any degree of elevation in serum tryptase suggests anaphylaxis, although a normal level does not exclude the possibility of anaphylaxis. In contrast, tryptase levels in ISCLS should be normal. Patients with anaphylaxis have normal albumin levels as well. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis-in-children-and-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of anaphylaxis in children and adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-tests-to-support-the-clinical-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory tests to support the clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anaphylactic attacks of systemic mastocytosis</strong> &ndash; Systemic mastocytosis is a rare disorder of excessive mast cell accumulation in one or more tissues, most often afflicting adults. Patients present with sudden episodes of symptoms caused by massive release of mast cell mediators. Symptoms include flushing, syncope, vascular collapse, and anaphylaxis. Mastocytosis &quot;attacks&quot; may be precipitated by triggers that nonspecifically activate mast cells, such as exercise, alcohol, emotional stress, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a>, opiates, infections, exposure to iodinated contrast, and <span class=\"nowrap\">medical/surgical</span> procedures. Serum tryptase is constitutively elevated in most patients and is an important diagnostic clue.

Edema may also affect the upper respiratory tract, leading to life-threatening airway obstruction. The swelling gradually worsens for 12 to 36 hours and then subsides over a few days. Unlike the generalized edema of ISCLS, the cutaneous swelling of hereditary angioedema is localized, usually asymmetric, and most often affects the face, extremities, genitals, or a limited area of the trunk. Patients with gastrointestinal angioedema can become hypotensive if they have repeated vomiting or diarrhea, but they do not have concomitant generalized edema and do not develop cutaneous and intestinal angioedema simultaneously. However, if there is uncertainty, hereditary angioedema can be distinguished by the presence of a low level of complement component 4 (C4) during attacks in nearly all cases. In contrast, C4 should be normal in patients with ISCLS. Hereditary angioedema is reviewed in detail separately.

Inadequate fluid resuscitation can lead to stroke and other end-organ ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-systemic-capillary-leak-syndrome/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>], while overly aggressive fluid resuscitation can lead to pulmonary edema and compartment syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-systemic-capillary-leak-syndrome/abstract/34,35,52-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35,52-59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Assess perfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the airway and breathing are being stabilized, the adequacy of perfusion should be evaluated. The blood pressure needs to be assessed early and often because it is the most common indicator that perfusion is inadequate. However, hypoperfusion can occur even in the absence of hypotension. Common signs of hypovolemia and hypoperfusion include, tachycardia, cool and vasoconstricted skin, restlessness or obtundation, oliguria or anuria, and lactic acidosis. Patients with chronic hypertension may develop critical hypoperfusion at a higher blood pressure than healthy patients (ie, relative hypotension).

A CVC can be used to infuse intravenous fluids, infuse medications, infuse blood products, and draw blood. It can also be used for hemodynamic monitoring. Mean arterial blood pressure, central venous oxyhemoglobin saturation (S<sub>cv</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), central venous pressure (CVP), and urine output are frequently used to monitor the response to fluid therapy.

Colloids are alternative intravenous fluids that normally expand the plasma volume by increasing intravascular oncotic pressure. However, they are costly and their effectiveness is probably greatly reduced in patients with ISCLS because proteins with a molecular weight &le;200 kilodaltons (eg, albumin) leak from the intravascular to the interstitial space during the extravasation phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-systemic-capillary-leak-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Terbutaline increases cAMP by facilitating its production of cAMP, while theophylline blocks its degradation.</p><p>Much of the data supporting the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=terbutaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">terbutaline</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> was published prior to the widespread availability of IVIG. The most compelling evidence for treatment with these agents was a retrospective series that evaluated the clinical course of eight patients with ISCLS who were followed for 18 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-systemic-capillary-leak-syndrome/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. All of the patients were treated with oral terbutaline (dose not specified) and theophylline (serum target level 10 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/L)</span>. The patients had a median of six severe attacks per year prior to being diagnosed with ISCLS. In contrast, the median attack rate was reduced to 0.2 attacks per year after receiving the combination of terbutaline and theophylline.</p><p>Many of the episodes that occurred while receiving therapy were mild enough that hospitalization was not required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-systemic-capillary-leak-syndrome/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The one patient who continued to have severe attacks, and eventually died of shock, never achieved a therapeutic level of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a>. Breakthrough attacks seemed to correlate to subtherapeutic levels of theophylline in two other patients. Sustained release theophylline appeared to be the most effective formulation. Adverse effects from sympathomimetic stimulation were frequent with therapy, but improved with minor dose adjustments and time. A few patients received glucocorticoids intermittently.</p><p>There are additional reports that support the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=terbutaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">terbutaline</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> to prevent ISCLS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-systemic-capillary-leak-syndrome/abstract/3,16,17,56,59,71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,16,17,56,59,71,72</a>].

It is characterized by episodes of severe hypotension, hypoalbuminemia, and hemoconcentration. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Episodes of ISCLS usually begin with prodromal symptoms, followed by hypotension and edema. The hypotension and edema are due to fluid extravasation, which typically worsens over one to four days and may be complicated by a compartment syndrome. The capillary leakage then abruptly reverses and the fluid moves back into the vasculature. During the recovery phase, the patient is at risk for volume overload and pulmonary edema. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnostic evaluation is the same as that for hypotension or shock of uncertain etiology. ISCLS is a diagnosis of exclusion that is made when a patient manifests intravascular hypovolemia, generalized edema, and the triad of hypotension, hemoconcentration, and hypoalbuminemia in the absence of an identifiable alternative cause. The diagnostic evaluation generally occurs concurrently with initial management. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial management of ISCLS is aimed at securing the airway and correcting hypoxemia. This may require intubation and mechanical ventilation. While the patient's respiratory status is being stabilized, the adequacy of perfusion should be assessed. Patients with hypoperfusion should have their tissue perfusion restored using a strategy similar to that used for septic shock (eg, sequential 500 mL boluses of normal saline). Intravenous vasopressors may be useful in patients who remain hypotensive despite adequate fluid resuscitation or who develop cardiogenic pulmonary edema. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-sepsis-and-septic-shock-in-adults#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of suspected sepsis and septic shock in adults&quot;, section on 'Intravenous fluids (first three hours)'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After initial resuscitation and stabilization, treatment should then shift toward the prevention of intravascular volume overload and its complications (eg, compartment syndrome or pulmonary edema). Meticulous monitoring of the patient's fluid status is critical. Once the recovery phase has begun, nearly all patients require diuretics. Patients with renal insufficiency may require ultrafiltration. (See <a href=\"#H7998808\" class=\"local\">'Detecting the start of recovery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Therapy to prevent future episodes of ISCLS should be administered to all patients who have been diagnosed with ISCLS. We suggest monthly infusions of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Most reports have used a dose of 2 grams per month. (See <a href=\"#H700435\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous immune globulin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who do not tolerate or do not appear to improve with IVIG, we suggest the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=terbutaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">terbutaline</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). A reasonable regimen is sustained release theophylline (dosed to achieve a serum concentration of 10 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL)</span> and terbutaline (5 mg four times daily). (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Terbutaline and theophylline'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients who survive an initial attack, at least 70 percent are alive five years after diagnosis. Some patients with monoclonal gammopathies develop multiple myeloma over time. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-systemic-capillary-leak-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">CLARKSON B, THOMPSON D, HORWITH M, LUCKEY EH.
