It is a common problem in children and constitutes up to 40 percent of pediatric urology clinic visits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In some children, bladder dysfunction is a component of bowel and bladder dysfunction, previously referred to as the dysfunctional elimination syndrome, which involves abnormalities in both bladder and bowel function.</p><p>Daytime urinary incontinence, a common feature of bladder dysfunction, can cause major stress in school-age children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>], and negatively impact a child's self-esteem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Thus, it is desirable to identify and treat these children as early as possible.</p><p>The management of bladder dysfunction in children will be reviewed here. The etiology, clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis of bladder dysfunction and management of nocturnal enuresis in children are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-clinical-features-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and clinical features of bladder dysfunction in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of bladder dysfunction in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nocturnal enuresis in children: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of a child with bladder dysfunction is primarily directed at improving symptoms and avoiding renal damage. Therapeutic considerations include the underlying cause of bladder dysfunction including behavioral and neurodevelopment etiologies, the age of the patient, symptom duration and severity, the motivation and attention span of the patient and family, and the presence of potential risk factors for renal injury such as recurrent urinary tract infections or vesicoureteral reflux. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-clinical-features-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and clinical features of bladder dysfunction in children&quot;, section on 'Dysfunctional voiding'</a>.)</p><p>Data on effective treatment of bladder dysfunction in children are limited because of the following flaws in study design:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most studies are observational in nature and without a control group. This is an important consideration because many studies use a reduction in the frequency of daytime wetting as the major outcome measure but do not take into account that the spontaneous resolution rate of daytime incontinence is estimated to be 14 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are often confounding factors that make it difficult to determine which intervention, if any, was effective. As an example, a retrospective study that reported anticholinergic therapy was effective in reducing daytime incontinence failed to account for the effect of biofeedback therapy as a confounding variable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Oxybutynin'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The study population has often not been well defined; as a result, it is difficult to compare the results of different studies. In 2006, the International Children's Continence Society (ICCS), a global multidisciplinary organization of clinicians involved in the care of children with lower urinary tract dysfunction, developed standardized definitions of bladder dysfunction to address this issue. In 2015, the ICCS updated and revised these definitions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-clinical-features-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and clinical features of bladder dysfunction in children&quot;, section on 'Definition of bladder dysfunction disorders'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a lack of consensus among experts on the definition of successful treatment for bladder dysfunction. The ICCS has defined treatment outcomes for research purposes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This stratified set of definitions has also been used clinically and is based upon reducing the rate of symptoms as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nonresponse: 0 to 49 percent decrease in symptoms</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Partial response: 50 to 89 percent decrease in symptoms</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Response: 90 to 99 percent decrease in symptoms</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Full response: 100 percent decrease or less than one symptom occurrence monthly</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In our practice, we use a stepped strategy moving from the least to most invasive therapy in the management of children with bladder dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Conservative measures, such as voiding behavior modification and treatment of constipation (if present), should be tried before the use of medications or invasive interventions. Patients with significant behavioral and neurodevelopment issues (eg, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) are referred to a clinician with expertise in evaluation and treating these underlying conditions. </p><p>If conservative therapy fails to significantly improve the symptoms of bladder dysfunction, directed therapy toward the underlying cause of bladder dysfunction is used. These interventions include pharmacologic agents, pelvic floor relaxation techniques, biofeedback, neuromodulation, or intermittent clean catheterization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CONSERVATIVE MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conservative management is generally the initial approach to treating children with bladder dysfunction. It primarily involves voiding behavior modification including timed voiding schedules, and treatment of constipation, if present.</p><p>Although no controlled trials have been conducted to study the effectiveness of this approach, retrospective studies have suggested reduction in symptoms in approximately 40 to 70 percent of patients treated conservatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/4,8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8-10</a>].</p><p>This was illustrated in a retrospective study from a single center of 63 children with daytime incontinence who were initially treated with voiding behavior modification that included a timed voiding regimen and treatment for constipation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. At a mean follow-up of 8.2&plusmn;3.2 weeks, the following results were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Four patients were dry (6 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Partial response with greater than 50 percent reduction of incontinent episodes in 38 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Slight response with 10 to 49 percent reduction of incontinent episodes in 37 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No change in symptoms in 19 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In another retrospective study of conservative therapy (ie, timed voiding, modification of fluid intake, and pelvic floor muscle exercises), symptom improvement was seen in 48 of 74 children including improved daytime urinary control, reduction in episodes of frequency and urgency, and a decrease in the rate of urinary tract infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Another retrospective study of 390 children demonstrated that approximately 45 percent (n = 138) did not respond to conservative management. Most of this nonresponsive group (98 patients) improved with the addition of pharmacologic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Voiding behavior modification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of voiding behavior modification is to rehabilitate the bladder and sphincter function and return the child to normal voiding habits. It encompasses the following components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provide information about normal voiding habits to the family and, if age appropriate, the child. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-clinical-features-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and clinical features of bladder dysfunction in children&quot;, section on 'Definitions of symptoms'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-clinical-features-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and clinical features of bladder dysfunction in children&quot;, section on 'Normal voiding'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Review the child's voiding habits, identify habits that deviate from the normal voiding process (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F100505\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100505 \">table 1</a>), and clearly describe to the family the way in which their child's voiding differs from the normal process.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Set an individualized voiding regimen to establish regular voiding habits. This most often entails a timed voiding schedule with frequent voids scheduled every two to three hours during the day. Wristwatch alarms can assist the older child in remembering to comply with the timed schedule (timer watch) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a trial of 60 children initially treated with four weeks of standard routine care, patients who were randomly assigned to a timer-assisted regimen compared with those who remained on standard care were more likely to show improvement in the degree of incontinence (greater than 50 percent decrease in incontinent episodes, 60 versus 18 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Approximately one-third of the children on the timer-assisted regimen obtained complete and sustainable continence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Establishment of a fixed timed schedule is particularly important in a child with attention-deficit disorder. In some cases, working with the school system to create an environment conducive to frequent voiding can be helpful.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Review the posture during voiding and the need to avoid holding maneuvers, such as forcefully crossing the legs, or squatting with a hand or heel pressed into the perineum (Vincent's curtsy) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75506\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75506 \">picture 1</a>). Children should be encouraged to urinate before they have a sense of urgency, to empty their bladders completely, and to avoid abdominal straining. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Document the voiding process in a diary after implementation of voiding behavior modification. This voiding diary should include the time and volume of each void, the time of each incontinent episode, fluid intake, the time of each bowel movement, and any episode of fecal soiling (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F102378\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef102378 \">form 1</a>). Voiding diaries across the country vary in length (number of days) and are used both as a diagnostic tool and as a therapeutic tool. When the reliability of 24, 48, and 72-hour voiding diaries were evaluated, the 24-hour diary was reliable for recording the number of incontinent episodes, but only marginally reliable for total voiding episodes, the 48-hour diary was reliable for both, and the 72-hour diary was the most reliable for both.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Establish a reward system to improve the child's compliance and self-esteem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The system should focus on rewarding the child for following the recommended program and not for &quot;being dry,&quot; as their incontinence is not something they can control.</p><p/><p>Compliance with voiding behavior modification, especially timed voiding, can be labor intensive and requires a high degree of motivation from both the child and parents. It is more successful in older children between the ages of 9 and 12 years who are more motivated because of social pressures and respond better to instruction compared with those eight years of age and younger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of constipation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anorectal and lower urinary tract function are interrelated. As a result, constipation is often associated with bladder dysfunction, with a reported frequency of constipation that ranges from 30 to 88 percent of children with bladder dysfunction. This relationship between abnormal bowel and bladder function is referred to as the bowel bladder dysfunction (BBD) or dysfunctional elimination syndrome (DES), and is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-clinical-features-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and clinical features of bladder dysfunction in children&quot;, section on 'Bowel and bladder dysfunction'</a>.)</p><p>In patients with BBD, it is proposed that stool evacuation from the rectal vault relieves abnormal pressure of the overactive bladder. The importance of treating constipation is supported by the findings in a large retrospective study of 234 children with chronic constipation, 29 percent of whom had daytime urinary incontinence and 34 percent of whom had nighttime urinary incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Resolution of constipation by disimpaction and maintenance therapy was associated with elimination of wetting in 89 and 63 percent of children with daytime or nighttime urinary incontinence, respectively.</p><p>Laxative use appears to be beneficial in children with BBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. In one observational study of 46 patients with BBD and daytime urinary incontinence, polyethylene glycol without electrolytes (Miralax) resulted in an overall increase in frequency of bowel movements and improved urinary continence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Daytime urinary dryness was reported in 18 patients, a decrease in daytime urinary incontinence in 26, and there was no change in urinary symptoms in only two children. Laxative therapy was also associated with an increase in voided urine volumes and a decrease in post-void residual volumes.</p><p>The treatment of constipation consists of education, disimpaction, and bowel retraining including laxative therapy, and is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic functional constipation and fecal incontinence in infants and children: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Other measures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other conservative measures used to treat children with bladder dysfunction include dietary modification and avoidance of urethritis and, in girls, vaginitis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dietary modification includes the elimination of dietary products that increase bladder activity, such as caffeine, orange juice, tomato products, and spicy foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In addition, other dietary products may reduce the risk of urinary tract infections, which are associated with bladder dysfunction. These include cranberry juice and active yogurt cultures, which have a probiotic effect.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be counseled to avoid bubble baths or cleaning the perineal areas with soap, which can result in (or worsen already existing) urethritis or in girls, vaginitis. Poor perineal hygiene increases the possibility of perineal and genital irritation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Discomfort from these disorders during urination may contribute to voiding postponement with low voiding frequency and long-time intervals between voids, resulting in overdistension of the bladder. With continued bladder overdistension, the detrusor muscle becomes overstretched and hypoactive, leading to a weak or absent contraction referred to as an underactive bladder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-clinical-features-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and clinical features of bladder dysfunction in children&quot;, section on 'Voiding postponement and underactive bladder'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal voiding (reflux of urine into the vaginal vault during urination) can also lead to vaginitis. Girls suspected of having vaginal voiding should be instructed to sit for an additional one or two minutes after emptying their bladders to allow the drainage of urine that has refluxed into the vaginal vault to occur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-clinical-features-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and clinical features of bladder dysfunction in children&quot;, section on 'Vaginal voiding'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIRECTED THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If conservative management fails to relieve the symptoms of bladder dysfunction, the underlying cause of bladder dysfunction should be identified, followed by appropriate therapy.</p><p>Evaluation that includes renal and urinary tract imaging, urinary flow measurements, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> urodynamic studies differentiates among neurologic, anatomic, and functional causes of bladder dysfunction in children. The management of neurologic and anatomic lesions are discussed separately.

Specialized testing with urodynamics is often required to evaluate the nature of bladder dysfunction and determine the most appropriate treatment regimen, which may consist of pelvic floor relaxation measures, biofeedback, or the administration of an alpha antagonist.

However, further studies are required to determine whether botulinum toxin injection has a role in the treatment of patients (both adults and children) with bladder dysfunction and whether it is safe and effective long-term.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children with a neurogenic bladder, surgery is commonly used to alter the urinary tract for safe storage of urine <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> to achieve continence. In contrast, patients with non-neurogenic bladder dysfunction rarely require surgical intervention. In rare cases of non-neurologic bladder dysfunction, when markedly elevated bladder pressure develops, a child may require enlargement of <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> bladder to reduce bladder pressure, and thus prevent renal damage. Bladder augmentation is usually achieved by adding an isolated segment of bowel to the bladder.</p><p>Cystoscopy with urethral dilation is no longer routinely used to treat children with bladder dysfunction as there are little data to support the utility of this intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Catheterization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children who postpone micturition, the bladder becomes overdistended and the detrusor muscle becomes overstretched and hypoactive leading to a weak or absent contraction referred to as an underactive bladder, which was formerly called &quot;lazy bladder syndrome&quot; or myogenic failure. In these cases, bladder emptying is often incomplete, resulting in large post-void residual volumes and an increased risk of urinary tract infection (UTI). Clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) is an effective and safe intervention for bladder emptying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. It allows patients to attain continence and reduces the rate of recurrent UTIs. CIC should be done in association with an established timed voiding schedule. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Voiding behavior modification'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">LONG-TERM PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The long-term outcome of children with bladder dysfunction is typically excellent with resolution of their symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/83,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,84</a>].</p><p>This was best illustrated in a review of 199 patients treated at one tertiary center in the United States, in which 98 parents and 51 patients were contacted by phone at least 6.5 years after initial presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. At the time of follow-up, 91 percent of the patients no longer were incontinent and 82 percent no longer had urinary tract infections. This resolution of symptoms is most likely due to the natural history of bladder dysfunction rather than to medical interventions. </p><p>One study suggested that girls with childhood incontinence compared with those without bladder dysfunction are more likely to have urge symptoms and incontinence in adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1143180834\"><span class=\"h1\">RESOURCES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <a href=\"http://i-c-c-s.org/&amp;token=Zkfin9D2VnvyKuyqPl4Emg4b/bonVI5sgMFwTocDKC8=&amp;TOPIC_ID=6578\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">International Children's Continence Society</a> provides guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of bladder dysfunction, as well as information for the general public.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3915558735\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials.

Behavior modification should be geared towards rewards for following the treatment regimen rather than being dry, as being dry is out of <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> control.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In our practice, a stepped approach is used starting with the least invasive therapy (ie, voiding behavior modification), and if the patient remains unresponsive, moving to more invasive <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> costly interventions (ie, medications or biofeedback). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Conservative management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial therapeutic measures include voiding behavior modification with timed voiding schedules, and treatment of constipation, if present. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Conservative management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who fail conservative treatment, directed therapy is focused on improving the symptoms of a specific cause of bladder dysfunction. Interventions include pharmacologic therapy, biofeedback, electrical stimulation therapy, surgery, and clean intermittent catheterization. The choice of interventions is based upon the underlying condition and severity of symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the patient fails to respond to initial treatment, our next intervention is based on the underlying condition as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In children with overactive bladder who fail to respond to conservative therapy, we suggest a trial of an anticholinergic agent to reduce symptoms (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Our preferred agent is an extended-release form of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxybutynin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">oxybutynin</a> because its once a day dosing improves compliance. An alternative to pharmacologic therapy is neuromodulation; however, this is an expensive and not universally available treatment modality with limited data on its effectiveness in children. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Biofeedback and pelvic floor muscle training'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-urgency-incontinence-overactive-bladder-in-women#H3281666245\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of urgency incontinence/overactive bladder in women&quot;, section on 'Pharmacotherapies'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In children with underactive bladder and elevated post-void residuals, we suggest timed voiding and double-voiding. In some children, a trial of clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) is necessary to improve urinary continence (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Catheterization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In children with non-neurogenic dysfunctional voiding (abnormal contraction of the sphincter <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pelvic floor musculature during voiding) or primary neck bladder dysfunction, we suggest biofeedback therapy to reduce symptoms (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Although alpha adrenergic receptor antagonists have been used in treating these conditions in children, data are limited and their routine use cannot be recommended based upon the available literature.
