There are two major hemodynamic changes: fall in systemic vascular resistance and increase in cardiac output. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-cardiovascular-and-hemodynamic-changes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Cardiovascular and hemodynamic changes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Systemic blood pressure typically falls early in gestation and is usually 10 mmHg below baseline in the second trimester, declining to a mean of <span class=\"nowrap\">105/60</span> mmHg. This response reflects a reduction in systemic vascular resistance. In patients with up to moderate mitral or aortic regurgitation, pregnancy is well tolerated due to this lower SVR state. </p><p>A 30 to 50 percent increase in intravascular volume occurs in normal pregnancy beginning at 12 to 14 weeks gestation and peaking early to mid-third trimester. Cardiac output increases to accommodate for these volume changes by elevation in heart rate of approximately 10 to 20 beats per minute and an increase in stroke volume. In patients whose cardiac output is limited by myocardial dysfunction or valvular lesions (eg, mitral stenosis), volume overload is poorly tolerated and may result in heart failure. </p><p>Marked fluctuations in cardiac output occur during normal labor and delivery. Cardiac output increases progressively from the first stage of labor, sometimes reaching an additional 50 percent by the late second stage. The potential for dramatic volume shifts is heightened at the time of delivery in response to the physiologic transfusion, which occurs with release of vena caval obstruction and blood from the now contracted uterus; postpartum hemorrhage may exacerbate these volume shifts, which are tolerated poorly by women whose cardiac output is highly dependent upon adequate preload.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7775297\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of thromboembolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with pre-existing heart disease are at increased risk for thromboembolism during pregnancy. Pregnancy is associated with an increased thromboembolic risk due to lower extremity venous stasis resulting from inferior vena caval compression by the gravid uterus, and to a hypercoagulable state due to an increase in vitamin K dependent clotting factors and a reduction in free protein S. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-vein-thrombosis-and-pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in pregnancy: Prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A review cited above found a 2 percent incidence of thromboembolic events in 688 completed pregnancies in women with congenital heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-congenital-heart-disease-general-principles/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] compared to an expected rate of 0.05 to 0.10 percent during uncomplicated completed pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-congenital-heart-disease-general-principles/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Pulmonary hypertension limits appropriate adaptive responses to the circulatory changes of pregnancy and to the volatile changes during labor, delivery, and the postpartum period. Women with Eisenmenger syndrome can develop potentially fatal hypoxemia during pregnancy or the postpartum period.

A study evaluating whether new advanced therapies had an impact on outcomes suggested that there was a reduction in overall mortality from 38 to 25 percent compared to historical controls but that the risk of maternal mortality remains prohibitively high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-congenital-heart-disease-general-principles/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In addition to appreciable fetal morbidity and mortality, Eisenmenger patients poorly tolerate the hemodynamic changes associated with pregnancy and delivery, and are particularly susceptible to complications such as pre-eclampsia and postpartum hemorrhage. Preterm delivery and fetal growth restriction occur in at least 50 percent of cases, with only 15 to 25 percent of pregnancies progressing to term. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-eisenmenger-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of Eisenmenger syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The majority of maternal deaths occur during delivery or in the first week postpartum. A gestational fall in systemic vascular resistance augments the right-to-left shunt through a nonrestrictive ventricular septal defect. A sudden fall in systemic resistance can precipitate intense cyanosis, and a sudden rise in resistance with bearing down during labor can abruptly depress cardiac output and provoke fatal syncope. &#160;</p><p>Women with Eisenmenger syndrome should be counseled to avoid pregnancy because of high maternal mortality, appreciable fetal risk, and increased risk of thromboembolism.

Phlebotomy is not indicated except in women with hematocrits &ge;65 percent and hyperviscosity symptoms such as headache, loss of concentration, fatigue, and myalgias.

Women with congenital heart disease who have indications for cardiac intervention are generally advised to proceed with intervention prior to pregnancy (eg, percutaneous aortic balloon valvuloplasty for asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis to reduce maternal and fetal risks). However, the decision is much more complex when a valve replacement is required and a detailed discussion on the risk and benefits of bioprosthetic and mechanical valve options (specifically, conflicting maternal and fetal risk and benefits of anticoagulation) must be discussed with the patient.

Despite these advances, congenital heart disease remains an important cause of maternal mortality and morbidity. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal alterations in circulatory and respiratory physiology during pregnancy can have deleterious effects on the mother with congenital heart disease and on her developing fetus. There are two major hemodynamic changes: fall in systemic vascular resistance and increase in cardiac output. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Hemodynamic changes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary edema and marked peripheral edema should be distinguished from the normal physiologic peripheral edema of pregnancy. The edema typically seen during pregnancy does not connote excess risk and is due to an increase in total exchangeable sodium and water and inferior vena caval compression. Diuretics are not indicated and sodium restriction is not helpful for physiologic edema. (See <a href=\"#H344632151\" class=\"local\">'Prenatal care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypercoagulability is a particular concern in women at risk for thrombosis related to prosthetic heart valves, atrial fibrillation, or previous thromboembolic events or intracardiac shunts. Such patients are candidates for anticoagulation. Considerations in choosing an anticoagulation regimen should include adverse fetal effects (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> embryopathy) in the first trimester, bleeding risk, and the risk of thrombosis on the prosthetic valve. (See <a href=\"#H7775297\" class=\"local\">'Risk of thromboembolism'</a> above and <a href=\"#H344632151\" class=\"local\">'Prenatal care'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-anticoagulants-during-pregnancy-and-postpartum\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of anticoagulants during pregnancy and postpartum&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-antithrombotic-therapy-for-a-prosthetic-heart-valve-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of antithrombotic therapy for a prosthetic heart valve during pregnancy&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We favor using the modified World Health Organization (WHO) risk classification for maternal risk assessment. (See <a href=\"#H534874635\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Modified WHO classification of risk according to maternal cardiovascular condition provides guidance regarding the frequency of prenatal cardiology and obstetric follow-up. (See <a href=\"#H534875510\" class=\"local\">'Modified WHO classification'</a> above and <a href=\"#H344632151\" class=\"local\">'Prenatal care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The following maternal conditions pose very high maternal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fetal risk during pregnancy: significant pulmonary arterial hypertension of any cause, severe mitral stenosis, severe aortic stenosis, bicuspid aortic valve with ascending aorta diameter &gt;50 mm, Marfan syndrome with aorta dilated &gt;45 mm, severe systemic ventricular systolic dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;30 percent, New York Heart Association III to IV), and native severe coarctation. (See <a href=\"#H534875510\" class=\"local\">'Modified WHO classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impaired maternal functional class, maternal cyanosis, and maternal medications expose the fetus to risks that threaten normal intrauterine growth and development. (See <a href=\"#H344628976\" class=\"local\">'Fetal risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The option of pregnancy termination should be discussed with women in whom gestation represents a major maternal or fetal risk. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy termination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Counseling regarding contraception should include consideration of whether a reversible contraceptive method or sterilization is preferable, the efficacy of various methods, patient-specific factors that affect compliance, and medical issues that affect the risk-to-benefit profile of various methods. (See <a href=\"#H34\" class=\"local\">'Contraception'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with congenital heart disease, cesarean delivery should be reserved for obstetrical indications, such as cephalopelvic disproportion, placenta previa, or preterm labor in a gravida on oral anticoagulants. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Role of cesarean delivery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Offspring of women with congenital heart disease are at increased risk of congenital heart defects.
