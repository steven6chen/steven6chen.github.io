In the revised convention for numbering amino acids of a protein, which includes counting the cleaved initiator methionine residue, the site of the Hb S mutation changes to position seven of the beta globin chain (to HBB glu7val). Herein, we will continue to use the beta six designation. </p><p>When deoxygenated, Hb S has a new property: the capacity to polymerize. Hb S polymer injures the sickle erythrocyte, increases its density, reduces its deformability, increases its adhesivity, and shortens its life span.</p><p>The polymerization of deoxy Hb S is the primary and indispensable event in the molecular pathogenesis of sickle cell disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The polymer has the form of an elongated rope-like fiber, which usually aligns with other fibers, forming a fascicle, and distorting the red cell into the classic crescent or sickle shape, among many other abnormal shapes, and resulting in a marked decrease in cell deformability. Hb S can undergo innumerable cycles of deoxygenation-induced polymerization and reoxygenation-induced depolymerization; however, the sickle erythrocyte membrane can withstand only a finite number of these cycles before it is irreversibly injured and recognized via the many abnormal shapes, including but not limited to the classical sickle-like form, that circulate in patients.</p><p>Polymerization alone does not account for the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease. Subsequent changes in red cell membrane structure and function, disordered red cell volume control, increased red cell adherence to vascular endothelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>], misregulation of vasoactivity, and inflammation also contribute to sickle vaso-occlusion and hemolysis that are the hallmarks of sickle cell disease. In genetics these are called pleiotropic effects, because they go beyond the immediate consequences of the abnormal gene.</p><p>The polymerization process and the modulating factors will be reviewed here. Other issues relating to the sickling process and an overview of structure and function of hemoglobin are discussed separately.

Studies at higher resolution using transmission electron microscopy have provided information concerning the structure and packing of the sickle fiber. X-ray diffraction studies subsequently refined the structure at a resolution of 0.2 nm (2.0 &Aring;) and provided information on molecular orientation and contacts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Structure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Analyses of deoxygenated sickle cells reveal the presence of parallel bundles of long fibers that are oriented along the axis of sickling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. In cells that assume a holly leaf shape, bundles of Hb S fibers point in the direction of each projection. Image reconstruction studies have provided data on the three-dimensional structure of the fiber [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The basic polymer structure is a double-stranded filament. Each strand is a string of deoxy Hb S beads aligned in head to tail (or axial) array. Seven filaments combine into a fiber organized such that adjacent double strands have antiparallel orientation. The twisted rope-like structure is composed of an inner core of four strands surrounded by a sheath of 10 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The double strands are slightly twisted in the fiber. Stretching of the outer strands in the fiber limits its size to seven pairs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A critical series of experiments that established the identification of the double strands as assembly units of the sickle fiber [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] was the use of naturally occurring mutants in hybridized co-polymerization experiments (binary mixtures), first involving beta-globin mutants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Later, these experiments were extended to alpha-globin mutants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individual fibers have an elliptical cross-section of about 23 nm by 18 nm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Since hemoglobin tetramers are globular molecules with a diameter of about 5.5 nm, one can calculate that up to about 15 molecules could be packed into a cross-sectional area.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Longitudinal views reveal a subtle but regular helix structure, in keeping with the elliptical cross section [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The helix has a high pitch with a periodicity of about 300 nm.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Intermolecular bonding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As mentioned above, our understanding of the intermolecular binding of sickle hemoglobin has come from structural analysis of crystals of deoxy Hb S and studies of the solubility of mixtures of Hb S with hemoglobins A, A2, F, and alpha- and beta-globin mutants, and more recently using genetically engineered site-directed globin mutants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/1,20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,20-23</a>].</p><p>In the fiber, the Hb S tetramer <span class=\"nowrap\">(alpha2/betaS2)</span> is oriented in such a way that the 6(A3) val of one of the two beta subunits (beta2) forms a hydrophobic contact with a complementary or acceptor site at 70(E14) ala, 85(F1) phe and 88(F4) leu on the beta1 subunit of the adjacent partner strand. Similar but not identical contacts are made with 6 val of beta2 in the other strand: 70(E14) ala, 73(E17) asp, and 88(F4) leu.</p><p>Importantly, the 6 val of the beta1 subunit does not participate in intermolecular bonding, a feature predicted by binary mixtures involving the beta6 and beta2 sites. Studies in Hb S Leiden, Makassar and Deer Lodge have determined that only one beta chain in the Hb S tetramer was involved in a contact area of the bonding fiber, since their mutations did not affect polymerization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/17,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,24</a>]. Furthermore, the contact between the beta2 beta 6 val and an acceptor site on the partner strand is only possible when Hb S is in the T or deoxy conformation. R or oxygenated molecules cannot fit into the polymeric structure.</p><p>There are other amino acid residues that affect bonding and polymerization:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The beta-globin mutants that alter gel formation tend to be on the beta1 or &quot;trans&quot; subunit and involve either lateral contacts between partners of the double strand or axial contacts between members of a single strand. Alpha chain contacts tend to be either axial or between double strands.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The amino acid residue beta 6 val is not the only substitution at this site that can cause hemoglobin to polymerize. A recombinant hemoglobin produced in <em>E. coli</em> with replacement of beta 6 glu (in Hb A) by another hydrophobic residue, isoleucine, results in a hemoglobin <span class=\"nowrap\">(alpha2/beta6Ile2)</span> that polymerizes even more readily than Hb S [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Solutions of Hb S and Hb D Los Angeles (HBB glu121gln) polymerize much more readily than a solution containing only Hb S and the glu112gln substitution stabilizes the polymer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Compound heterozygotes for Hb S and Hb D Los Angeles have a severe clinical phenotype.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interactions involving the amino acid residues of alpha 114pro and beta 87thr also appear to be important for polymerization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In contrast to substitutions at contacts that stabilize the polymer, these amino acid replacements result in a marked decrease in polymerization, and the beta 87thr substitution has been incorporated into a vector used in gene therapy in beta thalassemia and sickle cell anemia. Beta 87 thr is not a direct interaction site for beta 6 val in deoxy Hb S polymers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. It does, however, play a critical role in formation of the hydrophobic acceptor pocket, which then promotes protein-protein interactions, facilitating formation of stable nuclei and polymers of deoxy Hb S.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Studies with recombinant hemoglobins indicate that substitutions at remote sites (alpha 6ala, alpha 75Y and beta 121arg) exhibit additive, enhanced polymerization properties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">SICKLE HEMOGLOBIN POLYMERIZATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The polymerization of Hb S involves the self-association of identical molecules; no accessory molecules are involved. As a result, the assembly process obeys classic chemical rules of kinetics and thermodynamics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/1,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,30,31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Solubility of Hb S</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The polymerization of Hb S is a simple phase change from sol to gel. When a gelled solution of deoxygenated Hb S is carefully examined, large polymers (fibers) and free tetramers can be readily demonstrated, but species of intermediate size cannot be detected. Thus, the equilibrium between sol and gel can be studied by measurement of the concentration of free hemoglobin in solution after segregating the polymer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/1,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,32,33</a>]. This concentration is referred to as the CSAT: the concentration of Hb S in the supernatant of the gel.</p><p>For pure deoxy Hb S at pH 7, 20&ordm;C, the solubility is 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> considerably lower than the concentration of hemoglobin inside the red cell. The rate of polymerization of deoxy Hb S is dependent upon the Hb S concentration. Polymerization-induced membrane activation of volume-regulating transport systems, leading to enhanced dehydration, results in the presence of a substantial population of very dense cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. This dehydration of sickle erythrocytes involves increased activity of the membrane K-Cl cotransporter, the calcium-dependent (Gardos) potassium channel, and mechanosensitive channels like piezo1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p>The solubility of Hb S is also affected by a number of parameters other than concentration such as fractional oxygenation, pH, temperature, ionic strength, organic phosphates, and the presence of non-S hemoglobins. Attempts have been made to quantitate these variables, assuming a homogeneous distribution among the erythrocyte population, and to calculate the mean polymer fraction in patient erythrocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, the severity of the clinical course cannot be predicted from these measurements due to the heterogeneous distribution of these parameters in individual red cells.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Fractional oxygenation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since the structure of Hb S is nearly identical with that of Hb A when not polymerized, the two hemoglobins have identical oxygen binding curves in dilute solution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. However, at concentrations above the solubility of deoxy Hb S, the O2 binding curve is progressively right shifted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>]. Since Hb S polymerizes only when it is in the T quaternary conformation, the polymer binds O2 non-cooperatively and with low affinity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>The principles of thermodynamic linkage dictate that O2 affinity is lowered in direct proportion to the amount of polymer formed. Furthermore, because of the reciprocal relationship between oxygen binding and polymerization, the solubility of Hb S increases directly with O2 saturation. Fully oxygenated molecules of Hb S or partially oxygenated molecules that assume the R conformation cannot be incorporated into the polymer but indirectly lower the solubility because their large excluded volume greatly increases the chemical activity of the coexisting T-state molecules, thereby favoring their aggregation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. This nonideality consideration applies equally well to the solubility of mixtures of S and non-S hemoglobins and is a particularly important determinant of polymer formation at very high hemoglobin concentrations, as in red blood cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">pH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The solubility of deoxy Hb S is lowest between pH 6.0 and 7.2 and rises quite sharply at higher and lower pH values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. Thus, in the extra-erythrocytic pH range 6.5 to 7.5 (corresponding to intracellular pH of 7.0 and 7.2), the alkaline Bohr effect is enhanced in concentrated solutions of Hb S and in sickle erythrocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. On the other hand, alkalosis, by shifting the equilibrium toward the oxy conformation, tends to retard sickling, but also impairs oxygen release.</p><p>The significant difference in the slope of the Bohr effect in sickle cells means that a decrease in blood pH below 7.4 in tissue capillaries yields twice the normal decrease in oxygen affinity and a large release of oxygen from red cells, increasing significantly their risk of sickling. Clinically, this means that even mild transient acidosis (with a corresponding drop of intracellular pH) would be hazardous for patients with sickling disorders. The latter was actually experimentally and unethically demonstrated when patients with sickle cell anemia were infused with low pH isotonic solutions, and painful crises ensued.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Temperature</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The polymerization of Hb S is an endothermic process consistent with the importance of hydrophobic interactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/44,48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,48,49</a>]. Polymer formation is therefore entropically driven, resulting from the release of ordered water molecules from the surface of free hemoglobin. Sickle polymers are melted by cooling. Thus, a temperature jump is a simple and effective way of initiating polymerization, thereby enabling kinetic measurements. While low temperatures inhibit sickle polymerization, the therapeutic use of cooling is not advisable, since vasoconstriction and other vaso-occlusive effects might predominate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Ionic strength</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The solubility of deoxy Hb S depends upon salt and buffer conditions. At salt concentrations spanning the physiologic range, solubility increases with ionic strength, but decreases markedly at high ionic strength [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Organic phosphates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary modulator of O2 affinity in the red cell is 2,3 bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG). An increase in red cell 2,3-BPG favors Hb S polymerization in three ways: lowered O2 affinity; a reduction in intracellular pH (both of which increase deoxy Hb S); and a direct effect on the conformation of deoxy Hb S [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. High concentrations of adenosine may promote the sickling phenomenon both in vitro and in vivo through adenosine A<sub>2B</sub> receptor-mediated induction of 2,3-BPG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Non-S hemoglobins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Of particular and practical importance is the effect of coexistent Hbs F, A, C, and A2. Information on the copolymerization of Hb S with these hemoglobins has provided important insights into the pathogenesis and clinical severity of the various sickle syndromes, including sickle cell anemia with increased levels of Hb F, Hb S-beta(0) thalassemia, Hb S-beta(+) thalassemia, Hb SC disease, and Hb AS (sickle trait).</p><p>The solubility of a mixture of equal amounts of Hb S and Hb A (and that of Hb S and Hb C) is only about 40 percent higher than that of Hb S alone. In this mixture, half of the hemoglobin is comprised of asymmetric hybrid tetramers (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">alpha2/betaS/betaA)</span>. Since only one of the two beta 6 valines is engaged in an intermolecular contact, there is a 50 percent chance that the hybrid tetramer will enter the polymer in such a way that all the proper contacts are made. Indeed, incorporation of the hybrid <span class=\"nowrap\">(alpha2/betaS/betaA)</span> into the sickle polymer has been experimentally documented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. In contrast, the Hb A tetramers <span class=\"nowrap\">(alpha2/beta2),</span> which comprise 25 percent of the mixture, fail to be incorporated into the polymer. Nevertheless, by virtue of their excluded volume, the solubility is further lowered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>In contrast to hemoglobins A and C, Hb F and Hb A2 <strong>inhibit</strong> polymerization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Thus, the hybrid tetramers <span class=\"nowrap\">(alpha2/betaS/gamma)</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">(alpha2/betaS/delta)</span> fail to be incorporated into the sickle polymer. Since Hb F <span class=\"nowrap\">(alpha2/gamma2)</span> affects polymerization by means of the asymmetrical hybrid <span class=\"nowrap\">(alpha2/betaS/gamma),</span> the inhibition is trans to the beta 6 val contact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/45,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,56</a>]. Gamma 87 is one of the important inhibitory sites for both Hb F and Hb A2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. This residue constitutes one of the lateral contacts in the double strand of the sickle fiber.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Kinetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The polymerization of sickle hemoglobin is a remarkably dynamic event. Measurements of the kinetics of polymer formation, both in pure Hb S solutions and in sickle erythrocytes, have provided insights into the pathogenesis of vaso-occlusive crises [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. These studies led directly to information on the double nucleation mechanism responsible for fiber formation and growth, and studies on intact red cells have provided an explanation at the molecular level of the morphologic changes that are observed following the deoxygenation of cells, both in vitro and in vivo. Understanding the kinetics of polymerization has provided a novel and workable approach to the assessment of new antisickling therapies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-use-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hydroxyurea use in sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemoglobin S solution studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The time course for polymerization of a concentrated solution of Hb S can be monitored after either rapid removal of ligand (eg, by photolysis) or by rapidly increasing the temperature of deoxy Hb S, taking advantage of the markedly endothermic nature of the process. The formation of sickle fibers can be documented by a variety of physicochemical techniques including turbidity, light scattering, calorimetry, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The subsequent alignment of fibers is best monitored by measurement of birefringence.</p><p>Following ligand removal or a temperature change, there is a measurable lag time before a signal reflecting the presence of detectable polymer. The progress of polymer formation is exponential. During the lag time, there is insufficient amount of polymer to provide a signal, due to limitations of sensitivity of the methods used for monitoring.</p><p>The number of molecules in the nucleus appears to be proportional to the slope of the concentration dependence of the delay time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Nevertheless, when molecular crowding is taken into account (ie, nonideality) the slope of the concentration dependency of the delay time predicts a nucleus of about 15 molecules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Aggregates smaller than the critical nucleus are thermodynamically unfavored. In contrast, once the nucleus is formed, subsequent addition of molecules is highly favored and fiber growth becomes very rapid (approximately 250 hemoglobin tetramers per second) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Hb S must be in the T quaternary conformation and also must be unliganded for nucleation to occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. </p><p>Studies using statistical thermodynamic modeling have suggested that there are two pathways for the nucleation of sickle hemoglobin fibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Homogeneous nucleation refers to nucleation of individual fibers occurring in the bulk solution phase.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heterogeneous nucleation refers to nucleation occurring on the surface of existing polymers, which leads to autocatalytic formation of fibers, and therefore the delay period.</p><p/><p>In highly concentrated solutions of deoxy Hb S, homogeneous nucleation is favored.

However, when these variables are taken into account, the delay times of sickle red cells and the amount of polymer per cell at equilibrium are remarkably close to what is encountered in hemoglobin solutions, indicating that the cytosolic surface of the red cell membrane has no significant effect on the delay time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>]. Amongst sickle erythrocytes the delay time can vary according to the time needed for homogeneous nucleation to occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>The kinetics of polymerization plays a critical role in the rheology and morphology of circulating red cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Because the range of transit times in the microcirculation is short relative to the range of delay times of sickle erythrocytes, the great majority (perhaps 95 percent) of cells do not contain measurable polymer during their flow through arterioles and capillaries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. In contrast, if these cells were equilibrated at the oxygen tensions in the microcirculation, virtually all of them would contain polymer and as a result would have markedly decreased deformability. Thus, kinetics is the critical determinant of cell shape and morphology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When sickle cells are deoxygenated slowly, they form classic elongated (sickle) shapes. This is due to homogeneous nucleation in which one domain propagates by fiber growth and alignment to distort the cell into a classic sickle shape. With somewhat more rapid deoxygenation, a few independent domains will induce a more irregular shape [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When deoxygenation is rapid, multiple spherulitic domains result in a granular or cobblestone texture (&quot;sack of potatoes&quot; aspect) with no gross distortion of cell shape.</p><p/><p>How, and if the rate of cellular deoxygenation in vivo affects the clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease is not known.</p><p>Because the shape of the sickled cell is so dependent upon the number of independent polymer domains, it is possible to convert a holly leaf cell into an elongated sickle shape by partial reoxygenation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].
