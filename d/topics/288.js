The estimated frequency of acute liver failure (ALF) in all age groups in the United States is about 17 cases per 100,000 population per year, but the frequency in children is unknown. PALF accounts for 10 to 15 percent of pediatric liver transplants performed in the United States annually.</p><p>PALF is a rapidly evolving clinical condition. There are no adequately powered studies to inform diagnostic algorithms, to assess markers of disease severity and trajectory, or to guide decisions about liver transplantation (LT). The clinician must construct an individualized diagnostic approach and management strategy. Management requires a multidisciplinary team involving the hepatologist, critical care specialist, and liver transplant surgeon.</p><p>The pressing clinical questions faced when children with PALF first present are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the patient have a condition that is treatable?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is the risk of deterioration or improvement on each day the child is alive with his or her native liver?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is a liver transplant necessary for patient survival?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are associated morbidities reversible?</p><p/><p>An organized approach to answering these questions, including an overview of the causes of PALF, will be outlined in this topic review. Management of PALF and its complications in children are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-liver-failure-in-children-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute liver failure in children: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>ALF in adults is addressed in separate reviews.

With the exception of acute ingestions (eg, mushrooms, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a>), the precise onset of disease is rarely identified. Symptoms may persist or wax and wane for days or weeks before the child is brought to medical attention. In the absence of jaundice or other clinically evident signs of liver dysfunction, the child may receive empiric treatment to relieve symptoms, and some children undoubtedly recover before PALF is recognized. However, if there are clinical signs of liver injury or encephalopathy, or if blood work is obtained that reveals hepatic dysfunction, the clinical syndrome of PALF can be recognized.</p><p>Common features at presentation of PALF were described in a study from a multicenter registry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Encephalopathy &ndash; 53 percent (13 percent grade 3 or 4)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizure &ndash; 7 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ascites &ndash; 22 percent</p><p/><p>In addition to the 53 percent of patients with encephalopathy on admission, an additional 15 percent of patients developed encephalopathy within the next seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Encephalopathy is less common among children younger than three years and those with acetaminophen-induced PALF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-liver-failure-in-children-management#H18340160\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute liver failure in children: Management&quot;, section on 'Encephalopathy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18338296\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES OF PEDIATRIC ACUTE LIVER FAILURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific etiologies of pediatric acute liver failure (PALF) can be broadly categorized as infectious, immunologic, metabolic, and toxin or drug-related. In more than 50 percent of patients, a specific cause is not discovered, and in this case, the PALF is categorized as indeterminate.</p><p>Worldwide, the causes of PALF vary depending on the age group and region. The causes of PALF in developed countries are outlined in the Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F83285\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83285 \">table 1</a>), which is derived from a registry of PALF in children from 19 pediatric liver transplantation (LT) centers in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom between 2000 and 2007, known as the Pediatric Acute Liver Failure Study Group (PALFSG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In developing countries, the etiologies are similar but are dominated by infectious etiologies, among which hepatitis A is the most common (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F83764\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83764 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18338303\"><span class=\"h2\">Acetaminophen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Acetaminophen</a> (N-acetyl-p-aminophenol [APAP]; paracetamol) is widely used in children for management of fever and pain. APAP is safe and well tolerated when dosing instructions are strictly followed. However, APAP has a low therapeutic index, and in certain individuals or clinical scenarios, chronic administration of therapeutic dosages of APAP can result in significant hepatotoxic effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Two clinical scenarios are associated with APAP hepatotoxicity:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute single ingestion of a hepatotoxic dose of APAP that is greater than 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (typically an intentional ingestion by an older child or adolescent, or rarely an exploratory ingestion by a young child).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic ingestion of inappropriately high doses of APAP (&gt;90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, ie, &gt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> given every four hours) for more than one day may be associated with hepatotoxicity in some individuals. An accurate dose history is challenging in circumstances where chronic APAP administration is indicated to manage symptoms of fever and discomfort. Thus, the dose administered and the dose received may be inaccurate. Risk factors for developing hepatotoxicity include concomitant use of other medicines that alter hepatic metabolism, delayed medical care, younger age, and prolonged periods of fasting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. In the PALFSG registry, chronic APAP may have contributed to liver injury in about 10 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The clinical phenotype of chronic exposure to APAP in the setting of acute liver failure is similar to that seen with acute APAP toxicity: marked elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), accompanied by a low total bilirubin. The pathophysiology of chronic exposure and its relationship, if any, to PALF remains poorly understood. A careful history of APAP administration should be obtained in patients with PALF.</p><p/><p>In patients with PALF, acute or chronic APAP exposure typically is characterized by high alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and relatively modest elevations in total bilirubin. In the PALFSG registry, children with chronic APAP exposure were younger than those with acute APAP exposure, and also had worse 21-day outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Whether the difference in outcome was related to age, differences in treatment (eg, use of n-acetylcysteine), or other underlying contributors to liver disease remains to be determined. The pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of APAP poisoning in children are discussed in detail in separate topic reviews.

In some cases, these markers are nonspecific, since they can be found in patients with other known causes of liver failure, such as Wilson disease (WD) and drug-induced liver failure. In other cases of PALF, patients have a clinical picture consistent with autoimmune hepatitis, with markedly elevated autoimmune markers <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> total serum protein, characteristic histological features, and apparent response to treatment with corticosteroids.</p><p>More than 25 percent of the cases in the PALFSG registry had positive autoimmune markers (antinuclear antibody [ANA], anti-smooth muscle antibody [SMA], <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> liver-kidney microsomal antibody [LKM]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The true frequency of positive autoimmune markers in PALF is not known because these tests are not consistently obtained in the patient population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The frequency of autoimmune markers in PALF is similar across age groups, including in infants between 9 weeks and 12 months of age, and is evenly distributed among males and females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Therefore, an autoimmune mechanism should be considered in all age groups outside of the neonatal period. This pattern is in contrast to chronic autoimmune hepatitis, which is most frequent in adolescents and adults and has a female predominance.</p><p>Establishing a firm diagnosis for autoimmune hepatitis is challenging in patients with PALF, and in many cases only a presumptive diagnosis can be made [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Isolated mild elevations of ANA are common and are not diagnostic of autoimmune hepatitis. Elevated serum globulins support the diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis, but are not always present. Similarly, the diagnosis can be supported by a liver biopsy if it reveals histologic features suggestive of autoimmune hepatitis. The interpretation of autoimmune markers and other laboratory and histologic findings is discussed in detail in a separate topic review. Of note, the simplified scoring system that is often used for diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] may not be sufficiently sensitive for children presenting with ALF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autoimmune-hepatitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autoimmune hepatitis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>If autoimmune hepatitis is suspected, patients are usually treated with corticosteroids, because these drugs can interrupt the liver injury in many patients. Among children who respond to corticosteroids, some children appear to tolerate weaning of the corticosteroids without recurrence of their disease. Recurrent disease appears to be somewhat less common in children with autoimmune-mediated ALF as compared with adults. Initiation of steroid therapy in the setting of PALF is a difficult decision. Steroid treatment may be the only option for a critically ill deteriorating child, and can be valuable if the patient does have an autoimmune mechanism of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. On the other hand, steroids also may cause mental status changes that interfere with assessments of encephalopathy and also increase risk for sepsis, which is a frequent cause of death in this population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18338347\"><span class=\"h3\">Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an enigmatic condition involving immune dysfunction. Up to 25 percent of cases are familial, and mutations in genes affecting granule-dependent cytotoxicity are identified in about half of affected patients. The remainder of cases (and some of the genetic cases) may be triggered by acute viral infection, particularly Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].

The new name reflects the recognition that an alloimmune mechanism is responsible for the disorder. Maternal immunoglobulin G appears to activate fetal complement that leads to the formation of membrane attack complex, resulting in liver cell injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The degree of liver injury can be profound, so that death from liver failure can occur within the first few weeks of life. Liver failure associated with GALD is technically a terminal event of a chronic intrauterine liver disease. However, the typical phenotype of the family's index case of GALD is one of acute liver failure presenting during the neonatal period, so it is discussed here for clinical purposes.</p><p>Most cases of GALD would previously have been classified as neonatal hemochromatosis. However, the terms are not synonymous: GALD is an intrauterine disease process causing severe fetal liver injury, often but not always accompanied by the hepatic and extrahepatic iron deposition that characterizes neonatal hemochromatosis. Neonatal hemochromatosis is the phenotypic expression in the neonate of severe liver injury initiated in utero, most commonly caused by GALD.</p><p>Characteristic clinical features of GALD include refractory hypoglycemia, severe coagulopathy, hypoalbuminemia, elevated serum ferritin (&gt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL),</span> and ascites. Strikingly, serum aminotransferase levels are normal or near normal, which helps to distinguish GALD from other causes of liver failure that present during the neonatal period. Extrahepatic iron deposition is a hallmark finding. Hemosiderin deposition in the minor salivary glands obtained by a buccal mucosal biopsy is often seen. Characteristic findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen include reduced T2-weighted intensity of the pancreas relative to the spleen. MRI can also detect excess extramedullary iron deposition in the brain and heart.</p><p>The differential diagnosis of GALD includes inborn errors of metabolism. As an example, a neonate with clinical and autopsy findings consistent with GALD was found to have a homozygous mutation in deoxyguanosine kinase (<em>DGUOK</em>)<em> </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Mutations in DGUOK can cause a mitochondrial depletion syndrome with hepatocerebral manifestations.

Such nomenclature implies the etiology is due to an undetected or yet-to-be discovered virus. However, efforts to identify novel or unexpected hepatotropic viruses in adults have been unrevealing; similar efforts have not yet been rigorously undertaken in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>One study reported that APAP-cysteine adducts (a biomarker of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a> exposure) were found in 12 percent of children with I-PALF and no clear history of toxic exposure to acetaminophen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. This finding raises the possibility that unsuspected APAP toxicity may be present in some patients with I-PALF, but the relative importance of acetaminophen in the etiopathogenesis of PALF in those patients is uncertain.</p><p>I-PALF likely consists of multiple patient sub-groups (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F83775\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83775 \">figure 1</a>). One subgroup reflects patients with an incomplete diagnostic evaluation, either because of variation in diagnostic prioritization or premature interruption of the planned diagnostic tests by death, LT, or clinical improvement. For example, in one series, the majority of patients classified as I-PALF were incompletely evaluated for autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), since only 79 percent underwent any testing for AIH and only 55 percent had all three auto-antibodies determined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Another subgroup of I-PALF likely comprises patients with a pathophysiological injury that is not identified using our diagnostic strategies, including types of immune dysregulation or infection that are not captured by diagnostic methods. It is important to monitor hemoglobin, WBCs, and platelets in all indeterminate patients for at least four months, regardless of their transplant status, for evidence of aplastic anemia, which can develop following an episode of PALF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-liver-failure-in-children-management#H18340189\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute liver failure in children: Management&quot;, section on 'Aplastic anemia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18338410\"><span class=\"h2\">&quot;Recurrent&quot; liver failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In rare instances, a child will appear to recover completely from an episode of I-PALF only to experience a second or even third episode.

Rapid deterioration of liver function with the development of HE within six months is sometimes termed &quot;subfulminant&quot; or &quot;subacute&quot; liver failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-liver-failure-in-adults-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute liver failure in adults: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are no definite criteria for diagnosing pediatric acute liver failure (PALF).

For some causes, an effective treatment is available that could alter the cause of the disease. For other disorders, the diagnosis gives important information about prognosis and informs decisions about liver transplantation (LT). However, the ability to do a complete diagnostic evaluation of children with acute liver failure (ALF) is limited by the volume of blood needed to complete diagnostic tests, and sometimes by a rapid clinical trajectory ending in death or LT prior to a complete evaluation. As discussed above, nearly 50 percent of patients with PALF are left with an indeterminate diagnosis.

Because more than 30 percent of children with ALF are younger than three years of age, limitations on the volume of blood that can be drawn require a knowledgeable prioritization of tests. Laboratory tests fall into four different categories, with different priorities depending on the needs of the individual patient:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver specific tests to assess the degree of inflammation, injury and function, and to guide transplant decisions &ndash; At a minimum, measure serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total and conjugated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, prothrombin time (PT), and partial thromboplastin time (PTT).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>General labs to assess hematological, renal, pancreatic, and electrolyte abnormalities, and to guide management of these complications &ndash; At a minimum, perform a complete blood count with differential, and measure electrolytes, blood glucose, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, amylase, and lipase.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnostic tests to determine the cause of the liver disease &ndash; Depending on age and presentation, as discussed immediately below.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests required in preparation for a liver transplant.

While some conditions such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) can occur within all age categories, others such as gestational alloimmune liver disease (GALD) and WD are found within a more narrow age range. Therefore, age-based diagnostic prioritization enhances the likelihood of establishing a diagnosis as quickly as possible. The table lists diagnostic tests that would be most useful for children of different ages based upon the expected diagnoses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F83772\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83772 \">table 4B</a>).</p><p>Priority should be given to identifying conditions that are amenable to specific therapy, that would be relevant to subsequent pregnancies, or would be a contraindication to LT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The following disorders should be specifically considered because they are amenable to specific therapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute </strong><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a><strong> toxicity</strong> &ndash; We suggest measuring the serum acetaminophen level in all adolescents presenting with unexplained ALF, and in other children in whom an accidental ingestion or inadvertent overdosage seems possible. (See <a href=\"#H18338303\" class=\"local\">'Acetaminophen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Herpes simplex virus</strong> &ndash; We suggest routinely testing for HSV in blood by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in all young infants with PALF, as well as in older patients who are immunosuppressed, have vesicular skin lesions, or ulcerative lesions of the oral pharynx or genitalia. In these high-risk groups, we also suggest initiation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acyclovir</a> treatment while awaiting results of testing. We also suggest viral cultures <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> direct immunofluorescence assays of any vesicular skin lesions, or of liver tissue if a biopsy is performed. (See <a href=\"#H18338382\" class=\"local\">'Infection with viruses other than hepatitis viruses'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis</strong> &ndash; In patients younger than five years with fever and cytopenia in two or more cell lines, we suggest measurement of ferritin, triglycerides, and fibrinogen to screen for this disorder. (See <a href=\"#H18338347\" class=\"local\">'Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Autoimmune hepatitis </strong>&ndash; Because autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a potentially treatable cause of ALF in children of all ages, it should be considered early in the evaluation process to enable prompt initiation of treatment. Screening requires testing serological antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-smooth muscle antibody (SMA), liver-kidney microsomal antibody (LKM), and total immunoglobulin G (IgG), which can be estimated by subtracting the serum albumin <span class=\"nowrap\">(mg/dL)</span> from the serum total protein <span class=\"nowrap\">(mg/dL)</span>. However, autoimmune markers are found in conditions other than AIH, thus necessitating subjective clinical judgment to influence the final diagnosis and treatment strategy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H18338340\" class=\"local\">'Autoimmune marker positive'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Wilson Disease</strong> &ndash; Patients older than five years with PALF should be screened for WD by measuring serum ceruloplasmin. In addition to low serum ceruloplasmin, suggestive laboratory findings include a marked mixed or primarily unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, a low serum alkaline phosphatase, and hemolytic anemia with negative test for direct antiglobulin (DAT [also known as the Coombs test]). (See <a href=\"#H6015390\" class=\"local\">'Older children and adolescents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Metabolic defects</strong> &ndash; Certain metabolic defects related to carbohydrate, fatty acid, and protein metabolism are important to diagnose because they are responsive to dietary management. Selection of tests depends on the age and presentation of the patient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F83766%7EPEDS%2F83772\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83766 graphicRef83772 \">table 4A-B</a>). At a minimum, tests should include measurements of serum glucose, lactate, pyruvate, ammonia, and creatinine kinase to screen for mitochondrial hepatopathies. Lactic acidosis and an elevated molar ratio of lactate to pyruvate (&gt;25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mol/mol)</span> are common in all causes of PALF, so these tests are not specific for a mitochondrial etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In infants and younger children, serum amino acids and <span class=\"nowrap\">acylcarnitine/acylcarnitine</span> profile should be included in the initial evaluation. Genetic mutation analysis has become increasingly available to detect mitochondrial and other inherited disorders. However, results from these tests may not be available before medical decisions must be made to proceed with specific treatment or liver transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H18338361\" class=\"local\">'Inherited metabolic disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For neonates and young infants presenting with PALF, the newborn screen may help identify patients at risk or who have developed symptoms of PALF. However, the newborn screen should not be used as a &quot;specific&quot; test to diagnose a metabolic disease, nor should it be used to exclude a diagnosis should one be suspected. Some children will present before results of the newborn screen are available. Thus, the following tests should be performed in a newborn infant if the newborn screen is not available, or if there is a reasonable clinical suspicion for these disorders (see <a href=\"#H21413563\" class=\"local\">'Young infants'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Galactosemia &ndash; Screen by testing urine for reducing substances (eg, Clinitest tablet), and also perform specific testing of red-blood cell galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase before the patient receives a blood transfusion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tyrosinemia &ndash; Test urine for succinylacetone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hereditary fructose intolerance &ndash; For infants presenting with PALF after exposure to fructose or sucrose (in medications, juice, or formula), testing for hereditary fructose intolerance is essential.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gestational alloimmune liver disease</strong> &ndash; Gestational alloimmune liver disease (GALD; also known as neonatal hemochromatosis) should be considered in any neonate presenting with ALF, particularly if there is a history of neonatal liver disease or death in older siblings, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> if the degree of coagulopathy is more severe than the aminotransferase elevation. (See <a href=\"#H18338354\" class=\"local\">'Gestational alloimmune liver disease (neonatal hemochromatosis)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>If there is a strong clinical suspicion of other disorders (such as exposure to hepatitis A), specific testing is appropriate even if no specific treatment is available. This is because establishing the cause of PALF may reduce the need for other in-depth diagnostic testing and sometimes provides prognostic information that is useful when making transplant decisions. For example, a patient with a systemic mitochondrial disease presenting as ALF, either independent of or in association with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">valproate</a> toxicity, will not benefit from LT as outcome is uniformly poor. (See <a href=\"#H21413563\" class=\"local\">'Young infants'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23661634\"><span class=\"h2\">Liver biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Establishing a pathologic diagnosis by liver biopsy has not been considered critical in the management of a patient with PALF, primarily because percutaneous biopsy is associated with substantial risks of hemorrhage because patients with ALF usually have a coagulopathy. In addition, the histopathology analysis appears to have limited value in determining the treatment strategy or establishing the diagnosis. However, liver biopsies are increasingly performed by the transvenous (eg, transjugular) approach, because this technique markedly reduces the risks of hemorrhage in this population. The frequency of liver biopsy in PALF patients varies widely among institutions. Liver biopsy may be considered for those patients suspected to have WD if other diagnostic criteria are inconclusive, or for patients with indeterminate or autoimmune marker-positive PALF for whom corticosteroid therapy is being considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transjugular-liver-biopsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transjugular liver biopsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22358670\"><span class=\"h3\">Nonspecific findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most causes of PALF result in diffuse hepatocellular necrosis. This pattern is typical of ALF resulting from viral infections, most toxic and ischemic injuries, and some metabolic diseases. The degree of hepatocellular necrosis and its histologic pattern vary by cause and by individual case. Most liver samples from children with ALF show massive confluent or multilobular necrosis, with or without a moderate inflammatory infiltrate and evidence of regeneration. Occasionally there is a marked inflammatory infiltrate, consisting primarily of lymphocytes with a scattering of plasma cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F83773\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83773 \">picture 1</a>). The inflammatory infiltrate is not limited to the portal tracts but can be found within the lobule and around the central vein. Characterization of the inflammatory infiltrate using immunohistochemical&nbsp;markers for T lymphocytes (CD4 and CD8), B lymphocytes (CD20), natural killer cells (CD56) and macrophages (CD163) may provide insight into the pathogenesis of PALF and, in the future, help direct therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Occasionally, if orthotopic LT is performed early in the course of rapidly progressive ALF, the gross surgical and microscopic appearances of the liver are relatively normal. The lobular structure and framework may be intact, including a normal cord pattern, but the hepatocytes are necrotic. Inflammation is absent. This lesion suggests widespread, simultaneous lethal injury of hepatocytes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22358466\"><span class=\"h3\">Characteristics suggesting a specific diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following histologic characteristics support a specific cause of ALF. However, these findings are not diagnostic, and should be interpreted in the context of the patient's other clinical characteristics.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Steatosis &ndash; Diffuse hepatic steatosis is observed rarely in ALF in children. When present, the typical lesion is characterized by hepatocellular fat in a microvesicular (small fat droplet) pattern. The absence of cell necrosis in association with failure of liver function implies organelle failure as the cause. In adults, this pattern is seen most often in fatty liver of pregnancy. In children with ALF, the presence of steatosis suggests a mitochondrial disorder or other inborn error of metabolism (see <a href=\"#H18338361\" class=\"local\">'Inherited metabolic disease'</a> above). Alternatively, steatosis can be caused by toxins or drugs. Certain drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">valproate</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">amiodarone</a>) tend to cause steatosis, whereas others (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoniazid-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">isoniazid</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propylthiouracil-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">propylthiouracil</a>, and halothane) do not. If the observed histology differs from that expected by the drug in question, another cause should be sought. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-induced-liver-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug-induced liver injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Macrovesicular (large fat droplet) steatosis is seen in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is not known to be a cause of PALF, but given the increasing prevalence of NAFLD in the pediatric population, macrovesicular steatosis may be a coincidental finding in PALF. Whether NAFLD increases a patient's risk of liver injury from other insults such as infections or <span class=\"nowrap\">drugs/medications</span> to the degree that PALF develops is not known. Macrovesicular steatosis also can be seen with WD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diffuse swelling of hepatocytes, with only spotty necrosis &ndash; This lesion is characterized by diffuse swelling of hepatocytes with condensation of organelles and cytoplasmic elements, and is seen in association with some inborn errors of metabolism. Hepatocyte necrosis is spotty and usually not prominent. Macrovesicular fat with displacement of nuclei is seen in a variable proportion of hepatocytes, sometimes a majority. This lesion suggests organelle injury that is severe enough to cause the death of some hepatocytes. Aminotransferase levels and serum bilirubin levels are elevated moderately. Full histologic recovery can occur if the metabolic injury is controlled.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Characteristics suggesting AIH &ndash; Histologic features of AIH causing ALF include evidence of immune activation with the presence of a plasma cell enriched infiltrate, central perivenulitis, and lymphoid follicles with evidence of massive hepatic necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].

It may be caused by an acute or chronic overdose and is potentially treatable if diagnosed rapidly. Other medications that can cause PALF in a dose-related manner include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoniazid-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">isoniazid</a>, halothane, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propylthiouracil-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">propylthiouracil</a>. Many other medications and recreational drugs have idiosyncratic hepatotoxic effects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F83765\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83765 \">table 3</a>). Anticonvulsant drugs including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">valproate</a> are the most common drugs associated with PALF. Patients with unsuspected mitochondrial disease (eg, Alpers-Huttenlocher disease) are particularly at risk for hepatotoxicity from valproate. (See <a href=\"#H18338303\" class=\"local\">'Acetaminophen'</a> above and <a href=\"#H18338310\" class=\"local\">'Other medications or toxins'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Infectious causes of PALF, particularly hepatitis A, are far more common in countries in which these infections are endemic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F83764\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83764 \">table 2</a>). Herpes simplex virus (HSV) can occur in all age groups, especially in young infants, and is an important and treatable cause of PALF. (See <a href=\"#H18338368\" class=\"local\">'Infectious diseases'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is most common among adolescents, but is responsible for more than 5 percent of PALF in younger age groups beyond the neonatal period. (See <a href=\"#H18338340\" class=\"local\">'Autoimmune marker positive'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>During the neonatal period, important causes of PALF include gestational alloimmune liver disease (GALD [also known as neonatal hemochromatosis]), HSV, and inborn errors of metabolism, including tyrosinemia and galactosemia, and mitochondrial hepatopathies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F93730\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93730 \">table 5</a>). In all young infants with PALF, we routinely test for HSV in blood by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and initiate <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acyclovir</a> treatment while awaiting results of testing. (See <a href=\"#H18338354\" class=\"local\">'Gestational alloimmune liver disease (neonatal hemochromatosis)'</a> above and <a href=\"#H21413563\" class=\"local\">'Young infants'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Inborn errors of metabolism also may present with PALF during later infancy and early childhood. Causes include mitochondrial disorders such as fatty acid oxidation defects and urea cycle defects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F83766\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83766 \">table 4A</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F93730\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93730 \">table 5</a>). (See <a href=\"#H18338361\" class=\"local\">'Inherited metabolic disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Wilson disease (WD) is the most common metabolic condition associated with PALF in children over five years of age. It is characterized by a Coombs negative hemolytic anemia, marked hyperbilirubinemia, low serum ceruloplasmin, and a low serum alkaline phosphatase. (See <a href=\"#H6015390\" class=\"local\">'Older children and adolescents'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wilson-disease-diagnostic-tests\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wilson disease: Diagnostic tests&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An indeterminate diagnosis occurs commonly, particularly among children between 1 and 10 years of age. (See <a href=\"#H18338403\" class=\"local\">'Indeterminate'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Every effort should be made to rapidly identify a cause of PALF if possible. A focused history and physical examination help to narrow the diagnostic possibilities. Careful coordination of laboratory and diagnostic tests is helpful to ensure that high priority tests are performed expeditiously, with the highest priorities given to potentially treatable disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F83772\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83772 \">table 4B</a>). Tests needed for supportive care and transplant decisions necessarily compete with those needed for diagnosing the cause of the PALF. (See <a href=\"#H18338417\" class=\"local\">'Further evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Squires RH Jr, Shneider BL, Bucuvalas J, et al.
