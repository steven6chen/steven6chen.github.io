Stenting of the main pancreatic duct has been used to relieve ductal obstruction, often in the setting of refractory pain from strictures, stones, or papillary stenosis. In addition, stenting of the minor papilla has been used in the treatment of symptomatic pancreas divisum secondary to a stenotic minor papilla [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The indications, efficacy and complications related to pancreatic stents will be reviewed here. The role of pancreatic stents to prevent ERCP-induced pancreatitis is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prophylactic-pancreatic-stents-to-prevent-ercp-induced-pancreatitis-when-do-you-use-them\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prophylactic pancreatic stents to prevent ERCP-induced pancreatitis: When do you use them?&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INSTRUMENTS AND TECHNIQUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of guidewires, dilators, and stents are available. The choice of instruments will depend upon the clinical setting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Guidewires</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Guidewires vary in diameter (0.018&quot;, 0.021&quot;, 0.025&quot;, and 0.035&quot;) and length, and may be hydrophilic, straight, have a &quot;J&quot; tip, or a loop tip. They are available with various radiopaque markings to minimize fluoroscopy time. Some guidewires are Teflon-coated, which provides the greatest stability for stent placement and accessory exchanges. Electrically insulated wires can be left in place during sphincterotomy. Glidewire and &quot;Roadrunner&quot; are special wires used for difficult cannulation and access at ERCP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Dilators</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two types of dilators are most commonly used: balloon dilators and dilating catheters. Balloon dilators are inflation devices housed on a catheter, which are used to deliver a specific pressure to a strictured or stenosed area. They are available in several diameters and lengths. An inflation device is required to pressurize the balloon at a controlled rate.</p><p>Dilating catheters are available with a variety of tip sizes (3 French to 11.5 French) or as graduated dilating catheters. The French size of the tip of the catheter limits the size of the guidewire that can be used with it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Stents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biliary and pancreatic stents are available in varying shapes, sizes, and numbers of <span class=\"nowrap\">barbs/flanges</span> or pigtails. Biliary stents can be temporary (eg, polyethylene, Teflon) or permanent (eg, Wallstents). Pancreatic stents are usually polyethylene, ranging from 3 to 10 French size with two to four total barbs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Stent selection depends upon the size of the lumen and length to be traversed. The size and shape of the stent appear to have a bearing upon efficacy and safety when used for prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A retrospective study involving 479 patients who underwent pancreatic stenting found that small diameter (3 to 4 Fr), unflanged stents were significantly less likely to be associated with ductal changes compared with 5 to 6 mm stents (24 versus 80 percent). In addition, 3 or 4 Fr stents appeared to be more effective than 5 and 6 Fr stents in preventing post-ERCP pancreatitis (8 to 11 percent versus 11 to 17 percent). However, these smaller stents require additional wires and may be technically more difficult to place. A more recent meta-analysis indicates that 5 Fr pancreatic stents are superior to 3 Fr stents in preventing post-ERCP pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Similar findings on ductal changes have been reported in other series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, other studies have shown no significant differences based on stent size alone. More studies are needed to define optimal stent size and length for specific indications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Stent placement requires deep cannulation of the requisite duct followed by placement of a guidewire across the stricture or stone over which the stent is then advanced. Endoscopic sphincterotomy and stricture dilatation may be required but are not prerequisite.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Indications for pancreatic duct stenting include pancreatic duct stones, pancreatic duct strictures, pseudocysts, pancreatic duct disruptions, pancreas divisum, pancreatic sphincterotomy, and the prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Pancreatic duct stones</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pancreatic duct stones are found in 22 to 60 percent of patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The stones can lead to obstruction of outflow of pancreatic secretions, causing increased intraductal pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Because the pancreas is relatively noncompliant, the rise in intraductal pressure can induce tissue hypertension and ischemia, which may be a major factor causing pain in patients with CP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and pathogenesis of chronic pancreatitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pancreatic duct stenting may be beneficial as part of endoscopic therapy for pancreatic duct stones in the following settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Main pancreatic duct sphincterotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pancreatic duct sphincterotomy is the most critical part of pancreatic endotherapy, since it permits access to the main pancreatic duct, allowing various accessories to assist in stone removal. Pancreatic sphincterotomy can be performed with a sphincterotome over a guidewire or a needle-knife over a previously placed pancreatic stent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=precut-access-papillotomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Precut (access) papillotomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Facilitation of extra corporeal shock wave lithotripsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) of pancreatic stones should be considered when endoscopic procedures fail to remove large or impacted stones. In the majority of patients, a radiologic target system is needed, which can be provided by the placement of a stent. Fluoroscopic focusing of densely calcified stones can be achieved without pancreatography. The European experience has proven that ESWL is a safe, novel therapy for treatment of pancreatic stones, and this modality is increasingly being used at centers in the United States. It is an effective adjunct to the nonsurgical endoscopic approach in chronic calcifying pancreatitis with complete or partial relief of symptoms in 80 percent of patients, which is comparable to the surgical literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extracorporeal-shock-wave-lithotripsy-for-pancreatic-stones\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy for pancreatic stones&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Stones associated with pancreatic duct strictures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary indication for endoscopic treatment of pancreatic duct strictures is the symptomatic relief of pain. In patients with stone formation proximal to a stricture, the combination of stent placement and ESWL or endotherapy facilitates removal of fragments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Incomplete stone extraction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stent placement assists in drainage of pancreatic juices and fragments if stone removal is incomplete. Symptomatic improvement in these patients has been observed after sphincterotomy with or without endoprosthesis placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>Considering the above, endoscopic therapy should be considered as a first-line approach in the management of symptomatic main PD stones. Symptomatic improvement is most evident in patients with chronic relapsing pancreatitis. Factors that favor stone removal include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Three or fewer stones</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stones confined to head <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> body of pancreas</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stone size &lt;10 mm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of impacted stones</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of downstream strictures</p><p/><p>Multiple stones, large stones, or those associated with strictures require a combination of sphincterotomy, ESWL, stricture dilation, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> stent placement. Standard pancreatic stents are plastic with multiple side holes and flaps on both ends to assist anchorage. Stent size and length depend upon presence of ductal dilation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> strictures. After dilation, most ducts will accept 7 Fr stents. Stents can be left in place for 6 to 12 weeks prior to exchange, with the endpoint of therapy being symptom relief.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Pancreatic duct strictures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pancreatic duct strictures are common manifestations of chronic pancreatitis that may contribute to pain, recurrent acute pancreatitis, and exocrine insufficiency. Strictures may also be associated with stones, pseudocysts, and pancreatic malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>].</p><p>Endoscopic therapy for pancreatic duct strictures is indicated primarily for patients presenting with refractory abdominal pain, with or without upstream ductal dilation. Polyethylene and Teflon stents ranging from 5 Fr to 10 Fr size have been used. The choice of stent is influenced by the severity of the stricture, its location, and the diameter of the pancreatic duct.</p><p>The results of pancreatic stent placement for dominant pancreatic duct strictures have been favorable, with technical success in 72 to 100 percent, relief of pain in 75 to 94 percent, and good long-term outcomes in 52 to 74 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Pseudocysts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pseudocysts occur in and around the pancreas in patients with acute or chronic pancreatitis or ductal leakage due to other causes such as trauma. As an example, pseudocysts develop in approximately 10 percent of patients with acute pancreatitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-pancreatic-pseudocysts-and-walled-off-pancreatic-necrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of pancreatic pseudocysts and walled-off pancreatic necrosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Endoscopic drainage of the pseudocyst can be achieved by transmural cystenterostomy or transpapillary stent placement for pseudocysts that communicate with the main pancreatic duct. Pancreatic ductal obstruction caused by strictures or stones needs to be relieved to prevent pseudocyst recurrence. Adequate drainage can be accomplished by placement of a stent in patients in whom obstruction is in the downstream (near papilla) portion of the main pancreatic duct. Transpapillary drainage occasionally requires biliary sphincterotomy, followed by pancreatic sphincterotomy and placement of a pancreatic stent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic management of walled-off pancreatic fluid collections: Techniques&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-efficacy-and-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic management of walled-off pancreatic fluid collections: Efficacy and complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Pancreatic duct disruptions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ductal disruptions are common in persistent smoldering pancreatitis, pancreatic trauma, pancreatic necrosis, and in acute pancreatic fluid collections. Leakage of pancreatic secretions through these disruptions can result in the development of chronic fistulas, which can be internal or external. Closure of fistulas depends upon a number of factors including the site and size of duct disruption, whether there is superinfection downstream of the obstruction, whether the disruption is a consequence of a stricture or stone, and whether the ductal disruption is partial or complete.</p><p>Findings on ERCP suggestive of a duct disruption include extravasation of contrast during injection of the pancreatic duct, the presence of fluid collections or pseudocysts that communicate directly with the main pancreatic duct, pancreatic ascites, or the presence of a pancreatic fistula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Transpapillary stenting in conjunction with continued medical therapy has been successful in a number of settings including refractory pancreaticocutaneous fistulas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], pancreatic ascites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>], pancreatic pleural effusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], and pancreatic-enteric fistulas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Resolution of fluid collections and patient symptoms determine efficacy. Stents are usually retrieved after four to six weeks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Pancreas divisum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endoscopic therapy in patients with pancreas divisum continues to evolve with the availability of minor papilla endoscopic sphincterotomy, stenting, or sphincteroplasty (balloon or catheter dilation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-35</a>]. Stenting of the minor papilla has been used both diagnostically (in which a stent is placed to determine if ductal obstruction is the cause of pancreatitis or pain) and therapeutically. Short-term stenting for diagnostic purposes is of uncertain benefit, particularly in patients with infrequent episodes of pain (one or two times a year). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-pancreas-divisum\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of pancreas divisum&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In contrast, the benefit of stenting is more apparent after long-term follow-up and in patients with frequent pain or pancreatitis episodes. This was illustrated in a prospective trial in which 19 patients with pancreas divisum and at least two episodes of pancreatitis were randomized to dorsal duct stent placement or observation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The stents (3 to 7 cm long with multiple side-holes) were exchanged every three to four months and were left in place for one year. The stented patients had a much higher rate of improvement (90 versus 11 percent) due to statistically significantly reductions in hospitalization, emergency department visits, and episodes of pancreatitis. These benefits generally persisted over a mean 24-month follow-up period after stent removal. Similar conclusions have been reached in other uncontrolled studies.</p><p>Despite these encouraging results, stenting in pancreas divisum should be practiced judiciously after careful risk-benefit evaluation due to potentially worrisome ductal and periductal changes induced by stents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Stent-related ductal changes'</a> below.) This topic is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-pancreas-divisum\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of pancreas divisum&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Recurrent idiopathic acute pancreatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No obvious etiology is identifiable in approximately 30 percent of patients with acute pancreatitis. The role of pancreatic stenting in this setting has not been well studied. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of acute pancreatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Pancreatic sphincterotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endoscopic pancreatic sphincterotomy of the major and minor papilla has changed the approach to management of a variety of pancreatic disorders. However, in most reports, a higher rate of complications has been observed with pancreatic sphincterotomy when compared with biliary sphincterotomy primarily due to an increased incidence of pancreatitis. The risk may be greatest in patients with pancreatic sphincter hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>It has been hypothesized that achievement of adequate pancreatic drainage (either with a stent or a nasopancreatic catheter) could reduce the incidence of pancreatitis following pancreatic sphincterotomy. This hypothesis has been confirmed in a number of reports.</p><p>The role of pancreatic stenting to prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis is discussed separately.

The principal early complications include acute pancreatitis and pain, and much less commonly, perforation and cholangitis. Rare fatalities have been reported from sepsis and pancreatitis. Late complications include pancreatic ductal and parenchymal changes that resemble chronic pancreatitis, and stent malfunction, which is principally due to occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Early complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The spectrum and frequency of early complications can be illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immediate complications (including pancreatitis, pain, and ductal rupture related to catheter dilation) were observed in 24 percent of 21 patients in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Pancreatitis appears to be more likely after a failed attempt at pancreatic stent insertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early complications (including bleeding, pancreatitis, and a guidewire fracture requiring surgical removal of the broken fragment) developed in 18 percent of 51 patients in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A higher rate of acute pancreatitis (39 percent) was noted in a series of 23 patients after initial placement or exchange of stents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute cholangitis is another complication of stent placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/24,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Late complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most concerning long-term complication related to pancreatic stents is the development of pancreatic ductal and sometimes parenchymal changes that resemble chronic pancreatitis.

Similar to biliary stents, larger caliber pancreatic stents have longer patency rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. One series, for example, observed only a 13 percent occlusion rate at two months when a 10 Fr stent was used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In addition, larger side holes may also decrease the rate of occlusion. A study of 68 patients found that stents with larger side holes were 54 percent less likely to be occluded at the time of removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>The adherence of proteins to the inner surface of the stent seems to play a central role in stent occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The occluding material often consists of a protein matrix laden with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-carbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium carbonate</a> crystals, bacteria, and necrotic cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>The development of occlusion may be associated with pain or acute pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/23,45,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,45,48</a>]. As a result, most authorities recommend that pancreatic stents should be exchanged electively at predetermined intervals. However, the issue of when to exchange a stent has not been settled. Issues surrounding this uncertainty are the variable rate with which patients with clogged stents develop recurrent symptoms and the risk, cost, and inconvenience associated with ERCP. In one series, only 6 percent of patients with clogged stents developed pancreatitis or pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The low incidence of symptoms despite a high rate of stent occlusion suggests that the stent may function as a &quot;wick&quot; around which pancreatic juices continue to drain. Nevertheless, we recommend stent replacement every six to eight weeks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Stent migration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Distal migration (outside the duct) rarely presents a problem, but upstream migration (into the duct) may be more serious given the morphological changes in the pancreatic duct that can be induced by a stent and the technical challenges associated with attempts at retrieval. In one report, proximal and distal migration developed in 5.2 and 7.5 percent of patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Proximal migration was more likely in patients with sphincter of Oddi dysfunction and in those who were treated with longer stents. Case reports have demonstrated intra-pancreatic embedding of a pancreatic stent requiring surgical removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>] and the development of bile duct-duodenal and pancreatic-gastric fistulas as a result of stenting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>More than 80 percent of migrated pancreatic stents can be retrieved endoscopically (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F58513\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef58513 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Surgery should be considered in symptomatic patients with proximally migrated dorsal or main pancreatic duct stents in whom repeated ERCP retrieval attempts have failed. Direct single operator pancreatoscopy (Spyglass system, Boston Scientific) may facilitate removal of migrated pancreatic stents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications related to pancreatic duct stents are often found incidentally following stent removal and final pancreatography. Thus, it is important to obtain an adequate pancreatogram following stent removal, particularly if further stent placement is contemplated.</p><p>Complications can also involve the pancreatic parenchyma immediately surrounding the stented portion of the pancreatic duct, which may be visible during endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. It has been suggested that EUS may be used as a screening study to detect the earliest changes of chronic pancreatitis from stenting with a high degree of sensitivity. We perform pre-ERCP <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secretin</a> stimulated EUS during evaluation of patients with chronic pancreatitis. However, lack of a true gold standard for the diagnosis of early chronic pancreatitis does not permit absolute confirmation of specific EUS ductal and parenchymal features.</p><p>Acute complications from pancreatic duct stenting such as acute pancreatitis and pancreatic pseudocysts can be detected by noninvasive imaging, such as transabdominal ultrasound <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> computed tomography, and laboratory studies including serum amylase and lipase.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are multiple ways to decrease the risk of complications associated with pancreatic duct stenting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Indications and endoscopist experience</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is imperative that pancreatic duct stenting be chosen for the appropriate indication and that an experienced endoscopist perform the procedure. Patients with marginal or evolving indications should preferably be treated under protocol after careful discussion with the patient of the risks, benefits, and complications of the procedure. It is also important that patients have realistic expectations with regard to outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">Stent choice and replacement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of stent migration can be decreased by avoiding stents that extend beyond the genu of the pancreas. In addition, modifications of stent designs have been attempted to reduce the risk of migration. One possible approach is eliminating the two internal barbs, which in one report, decreased internal migration but increased outward migration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. As noted above, the risk of stent-related ductal changes may be reduced by use of small (3 to 4 Fr) unflanged stents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>].</p><p>While not all patients whose stents become occluded develop symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>], it is not possible to predict which patients are at risk. Thus, we suggest that stents be replaced every six to eight weeks since nearly 100 percent of the stents will be occluded by three months. Patients requiring repeated stent exchanges benefit from using varying stent lengths at subsequent visits, since the majority of stent-induced ductal changes occur at the proximal end of the stent within the pancreatic duct. Whenever possible, short stents are preferred over longer stents to limit the extent of duct in contact with foreign material.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h3\">Nasopancreatic stents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Placement of a nasopancreatic stent may be an alternative to pancreatic stenting. In two reports of 375 consecutive cases undergoing pancreatic sphincterotomy with drainage, a 5 Fr nasopancreatic drain was left overnight with pre-discharge removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. There was only a single case of mild post-ERCP pancreatitis upon nasopancreatic drain removal, 12 to 24 hours following placement. Advantages compared with pancreatic stenting include: eliminating the possibility of stent migration, potential for cost savings by avoiding the need for a repeat endoscopy to remove the 20 to 30 percent of pancreatic stents that fail to pass on their own, reducing the risk of stent related complications in non-compliant patients who fail to follow-up. Drawbacks include greater technical difficulty with placement and patient discomfort with nasal positioning and removal. Additional studies are needed to evaluate the role of nasopancreatic catheter drainage in pancreatic endotherapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h3\">Pancreatic stenting and removal technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proper stent placement and removal techniques can minimize the inherent risk associated with pancreatic stenting and should be emphasized in training and followed in practice. A full review is beyond the scope of this topic review, but a few points need to be highlighted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There should be a strong indication for prophylactic pancreatic duct stenting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prophylactic-pancreatic-stents-to-prevent-ercp-induced-pancreatitis-when-do-you-use-them\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prophylactic pancreatic stents to prevent ERCP-induced pancreatitis: When do you use them?&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pancreatic duct anatomy should dictate further attempts at stent placement and the choice of stent. As an example, a difficult ansa loop may prevent deep wire cannulation, suggesting that a shorter transpapillary stent may be preferable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. However, any stent will be difficult to place if there is not enough intraductal wire to &quot;pull in&quot; the stent, a point that has to be factored into the decision-making process.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stents should be either long enough to be clearly upstream of the genu or short enough to be just transpapillary. Stents with the upstream portion at or around the genu may be more traumatic and cause increased ductal injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Careful attention should be paid while placing the stent to ensure the stent is not inadvertently placed completely within the pancreatic duct due to increased wire traction by the assistant or an increased force on the pushing catheter by the endoscopist. Proper and final placement should be photo documented.</p><p/><p>Proper pancreatic stent removal techniques also need to be considered. Stent fracture <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intrapancreatic upstream migration while attempting removal can have serious consequences. It is important to grasp the stent close to the tip, distal to the flaps. Excessive tightening of the snare around the stent should be avoided.</p><p>Similarly, excessive pulling force by the endoscopist is not recommended. It is preferable to use the mechanical forces of the duodenoscope and proper extraction maneuvers to remove the stent (grasp snare with left hand at accessory channel, shorten endoscope with <span class=\"nowrap\">up/down</span> control and advance endoscope with clockwise torque).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stenting of the main pancreatic duct has been used to relieve ductal obstruction, often in the setting of refractory pain from strictures, stones, or papillary stenosis.

Early complications include stent migration, acute pancreatitis and pain, and much less commonly perforation and infection.
