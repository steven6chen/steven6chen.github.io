Biological events have the potential to be more readily disseminated and destructive than chemical or nuclear weapons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identifying-and-managing-casualties-of-biological-terrorism/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The United States Congressional Office of Technology Assessment has estimated that a 100 kg payload of aerosolized anthrax spores, if released upwind of Washington, DC, could result in 130,000 to 3 million deaths, matching the lethality of the hydrogen bomb [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identifying-and-managing-casualties-of-biological-terrorism/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Lethal amounts of biological agents are relatively easy to manufacture, conceal, transport, and release. However, there is a growing consensus that manufacture of biological agents requires some amount of tacit knowledge, thus limiting the scope of individuals who have the capacity to initiate a large-scale attack [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identifying-and-managing-casualties-of-biological-terrorism/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>As with emerging infectious diseases, detection and control of biological attacks depend upon a strong and flexible public health system at the local, state and federal levels. Additionally, well-trained and vigilant front line health professionals are required, especially in detecting covert biological attacks. Primary health care providers will likely be the first to observe and report any unusual illness patterns in the event of such an attack.</p><p>This topic will address the history of bioterrorism, the organisms of greatest concern, and the immediate management of persons with possible exposure. </p><p>Treatment of established infections, such as anthrax, is discussed in the topics dedicated to those pathogens.</p><p>Chemical terrorism is discussed separately.

However, even after ratification, most countries continued to develop their biologic capacity. The United States built an offensive weapons program at Camp Detrick in 1942 and continued to develop technology in this area, fueled by the ensuing Cold War [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identifying-and-managing-casualties-of-biological-terrorism/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. President Richard Nixon ended this offensive program in 1969. A multilateral treaty, known as the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), was developed in 1972, and has been signed by 175 countries. </p><p>However, there had subsequently been evidence of ongoing use of biologic weapons in other countries, such as Iraq and the former Soviet Union [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identifying-and-managing-casualties-of-biological-terrorism/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. The accidental release of aerosolized anthrax spores from a Soviet weapons plant in Sverdlovsk resulted in the deaths of at least 68 people from inhalation anthrax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identifying-and-managing-casualties-of-biological-terrorism/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16715233\"><span class=\"h2\">Evidence of prior bioterrorism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Terrorist groups and religious cults have also employed biological agents worldwide. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1211773\"><span class=\"h3\">United States</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, there have been several instances of biologic terrorism over the past few decades including the following events: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 1984, a religious cult intentionally infected restaurant salad bars in Oregon with salmonella, resulting in disease amongst 751 people; this episode revealed the vulnerability of the food and water supply [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identifying-and-managing-casualties-of-biological-terrorism/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

The group also attempted to disperse anthrax and botulism on at least eight occasions; these attacks were associated with no known illness. Other groups who have reportedly used biological weapons include the Viet Cong, who used focally contaminated spears during the Vietnam War, and the Mau rebels in Kenya, who used plant latex toxins to kill cattle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identifying-and-managing-casualties-of-biological-terrorism/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20472916\"><span class=\"h1\">THE ROLE OF REGULATORY AGENCIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been designated by the United States Department of Health and Human Services to coordinate and lead the planning efforts to upgrade national public health capabilities at the local, state, and federal level. Liaison channels now also exist between the CDC, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in order to better coordinate responses of national relevance. The FBI has jurisdiction over a bioterrorism response. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1212247\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF DETECTION AND RESPONSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Detection of biological agents can be difficult since biological events are frequently invisible and lead to slow accumulation of casualties, in contrast to chemical spills, which often lead to rapid casualties. The appropriate responses to a potential bioterrorism event include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surveillance, detection, and containment.

These early responses are important for timely distribution of prophylactic medications or vaccines. The CDC can often deploy a specialized epidemiological and laboratory response team to assist in the investigations of unexplained or suspicious outbreaks at the request of state health departments, or if federally mandated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H971560334\"><span class=\"h2\">The role of the clinician</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary health care providers, emergency department physicians, intensivists, infection control practitioners, and infectious disease physicians may be the first persons to recognize disease caused by a variety of biological agents, including pathogens that are infrequently seen. Clinicians must remain mindful that an outbreak of disease might be the result of an intentional exposure. Bioterrorism may be suspected when unusually high rates of a single illness are seen, or an unusual pathogen is isolated in the laboratory. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20472973\"><span class=\"h2\">Organisms of concern</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The CDC has identified a number of pathogens that could be used in biological terrorism and have ranked them into various categories based on their overall potential to cause harm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F79744\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79744 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identifying-and-managing-casualties-of-biological-terrorism/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. High-priority agents include organisms that:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Can be easily disseminated or transmitted person-to-person</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cause high mortality</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Might cause public panic and social disruption</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Require special action for public health preparedness</p><p/><p>The highest priority agents (Category A) include anthrax and smallpox. These agents are of particular concern because they can be grown easily in large quantities and are sturdy organisms, resistant to destruction. They are also particularly well suited to airborne dissemination, thereby infecting large numbers of people. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-anthrax\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of anthrax&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-smallpox\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations of smallpox&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Second highest priority agents (Category B) include those that are moderately easy to spread, and generally cause less morbidity and mortality than Category A, but may require enhanced diagnostic capacity or surveillance techniques. Examples include agents of Q fever or brucellosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-q-fever\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Q fever&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-brucellosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of brucellosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Category C agents include pathogens that could be engineered for mass dissemination either because of ready availability, or ease of production and transport. They are usually agents of significant potential morbidity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mortality. Examples include hantavirus or multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hantavirus-cardiopulmonary-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and complications of pulmonary tuberculosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5382341\"><span class=\"h2\">Toxins of concern</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ricin, listed as a Category B agent, is a toxin naturally found in castor beans. The clinical manifestations of ricin poisoning differ by route of exposure. Inhalational ricin may cause respiratory distress, fever, cough and pulmonary edema. Effects of this toxin may occur within eight hours of inhalation. Ingestion of ricin can lead to symptoms of vomiting, bloody diarrhea and dehydration within six hours. In severe cases, multi-organ failure can occur. </p><p>There is no proven antidote; supportive care and possible gastric lavage and activated charcoal can be considered. Decontamination procedures should be undertaken for skin or clothing contamination since ricin can also cause burns. </p><p>Trichothecene mycotoxins, derived from fungi, have also been used in aerosolized or powdered formulations for bioterrorism. These mycotoxins can lead to minor symptoms such as contact pruritis, burning, or blistering to severe symptoms such as vomiting and ataxia with hypotension and coagulopathy. Inhalation or ingestion are more likely to cause systemic effects than cutaneous exposures. No vaccine or chemoprophylactic agents exist.</p><p>If ricin or mycotoxin exposure is suspected, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) should be contacted for assistance, including diagnosis. Early consideration of toxin exposure is needed for appropriate decontamination procedures and supportive care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1500621998\"><span class=\"h1\">PUBLIC HEALTH NOTIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the event of a possible terrorist event, local emergency response systems should be activated by dialing 911 in the United States, or equivalent emergency telephone numbers in other countries. In communities without 911 systems, local law enforcement officials should be notified. The local FBI office and local and state public health authorities should also be notified, who will notify federal agencies if required.</p><p>In the United States, a number of prominent academic centers have created Preparedness and Emergency Response Research Centers (PERRCs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identifying-and-managing-casualties-of-biological-terrorism/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. These centers act as coordinating points to improve cooperation between public health and emergency medical systems.</p><p>The public health response to bioterrorism also requires effective communication and coordination with first responders and law enforcement officials. Public messaging through the general media can alert the wider community. Collaboration between the media and public health agencies has occurred during prior major outbreaks in the United States (ie, anthrax and pandemic influenza).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16715268\"><span class=\"h1\">CONFIRMATION AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once a potential bioterrorist event has been suspected or detected, the etiologic agent must be confirmed.</p><p>Appropriate collection of clinical specimens is crucial to detection. Post-exposure specimens should be collected within the first 24 hours and prophylaxis should be offered (if available). Most clinical specimens include a nasal swab or sputum; culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing are usually performed. In some cases, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorescein</a> antibody testing (FA) is also possible, such as for Francisella tularensis. In general, for symptomatic patients, especially with pulmonary symptoms, lower respiratory tract sputums (induced if necessary) are ideal. Nasal swabs are an alternative. </p><p>Serum is needed for toxin assays when botulism is suspected. </p><p>As part of the national preparedness effort, a network of laboratories that communicate directly with the public health infrastructure has been developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identifying-and-managing-casualties-of-biological-terrorism/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Similar moves in the European Union plan to link all major biosafety laboratories together to enable a more effective response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identifying-and-managing-casualties-of-biological-terrorism/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Every state public health laboratory in the United States now has the ability to respond to a biological terrorism emergency, either individually or through the regional or federal support system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16715275\"><span class=\"h1\">DECONTAMINATION (OVERT EXPOSURE)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The extent of decontamination required in the event of a biological event depends on the degree of spread in an affected area, the number of individuals affected, and most critically, the organism of concern. Public health experts, emergency responders and possibly criminal experts will guide such a response.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1212302\"><span class=\"h2\">Personal decontamination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If personal decontamination is required, the CDC guidelines recommend that all clothing and personal effects be removed and placed in plastic bags. Persons should be instructed to shower using copious quantities of soap and water. Plastic bags with personal effects should be labeled clearly with the owner's name, contact telephone number, and inventory of the bag's contents. Personal items may be kept as evidence in a criminal trial or returned to the owner if the threat is unsubstantiated.</p><p>Careful hand cleansing is important; one study evaluated different agents that might be used for hand washing after contact with anthrax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identifying-and-managing-casualties-of-biological-terrorism/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Regular soap and water were as effective in the removal of spores similar to anthrax as antimicrobial soap or 2 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a> gluconate. However, an ethyl alcohol waterless rub was <strong>not</strong> active against these spores and is not recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identifying-and-managing-casualties-of-biological-terrorism/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].

This will include overload of medical facilities by the &quot;worried well&quot; and grief responses by the survivors. Furthermore, past experience with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) suggested that some people who were ill delayed seeking care, because they perceived medical centers as being the source of the contagion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identifying-and-managing-casualties-of-biological-terrorism/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Psychological morbidity for first-responders, medical personnel, and the public can be significant in the event of a terrorist event, so clinicians should be mindful of depression, pathologic bereavement, acute stress disorder (ASD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identifying-and-managing-casualties-of-biological-terrorism/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16715303\"><span class=\"h1\">EMERGENCY RESOURCES</span></p><p>CDC &ndash; Division of Emergency Preparedness and Response</p><p>www.emergency.cdc.<span class=\"nowrap\">gov/</span></p><p>CDC Emergency Response Coordinating Group:</p><p>770-488-7100 (health professionals or government officials only)</p><p>Regional Poison Control Centers:</p><p>1-800-222-1222</p><p>CDC Coordinating Office for Terrorism Preparedness and Emergency Response:</p><p>404-639-7405</p><p>CDC Division of Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response:</p><p>404-639-0385</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5182875\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Detection of biological agents can be difficult since biological events are frequently invisible and lead to slow accumulation of casualties, in contrast to chemical spills, which often lead to rapid casualties. (See <a href=\"#H1212247\" class=\"local\">'Overview of detection and response'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An astute clinician may be the first to recognize either a large outbreak of one disease or an unusual pathogen, which may be the first sign of biological terrorism. (See <a href=\"#H971560334\" class=\"local\">'The role of the clinician'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Effective surveillance systems for detection of biological outbreaks need to include real time data from emergency rooms, laboratories, pharmacies and even schools to identify patterns of illness. These early responses are important for timely distribution of prophylactic medications or vaccines. (See <a href=\"#H16715254\" class=\"local\">'Surveillance and detection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The CDC has identified a number of pathogens that could be used in biological terrorism and have ranked them into various categories based on their overall potential to cause harm. The pathogens of greatest concern include anthrax and smallpox. (See <a href=\"#H20472973\" class=\"local\">'Organisms of concern'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the event of a possible terrorist event, local emergency responses systems should be activated by dialing 911 in the United States, or equivalent emergency telephone numbers in other countries. (See <a href=\"#H1500621998\" class=\"local\">'Public health notification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Post-exposure specimens should be collected within the first 24 hours and prophylaxis should be offered (if available). Most clinical specimens include a nasal swab or sputum; culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing are usually performed. (See <a href=\"#H16715268\" class=\"local\">'Confirmation and diagnostic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In overt exposures, both personal and environmental decontamination may be required.

(See <a href=\"#H1212400\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The type of prophylaxis will depend on the agent or toxin that is suspected; possibilities include chemoprophylaxis (eg, antibiotics), immunizations, or antitoxins. (See <a href=\"#H945812443\" class=\"local\">'Prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Airborne, droplet or contact precautions will be established depending on the agent of concern.
