Episodes of travelers' diarrhea are nearly always benign and self-limited, but the dehydration that can complicate an episode may be severe and pose a greater health hazard than the illness itself. Nevertheless, it is possible to educate a traveler to manage a diarrheal episode without compromising either their trip or their health.</p><p>The microbiology, epidemiology, and prevention of travelers' diarrhea are discussed here. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of travelers' diarrhea are discussed elsewhere.

These forms of travelers' diarrhea are defined as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-microbiology-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Classic &ndash; Passage of three or more unformed stools in a 24 hour period plus at least one of these other symptoms: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or cramps, fever, blood in stools</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderate &ndash; Passage of one or two unformed stools in 24 hours plus at least one of the above symptoms or more than two unformed stools in 24 hours without other symptoms</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild &ndash; Passage of one or two unformed stools in 24 hours without other symptoms</p><p/><p>These definitions allow some uniformity in studies of the epidemiology and etiologies of travelers' diarrhea. For such studies, the three types can be grouped together to estimate a total number of cases of travelers' diarrhea. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-fever-in-the-returning-traveler\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of fever in the returning traveler&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Travelers' diarrhea is an infectious illness, caused by a variety of bacterial, viral, and parasitic organisms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F62537\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62537 \">table 1</a>), although bacterial pathogens are the most frequent cause in acute cases. More than 90 percent of illnesses in most geographic areas are caused by bacteria; the most common organism is enterotoxigenic <em>Escherichia coli</em> (ETEC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-microbiology-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/1,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,7</a>]. For patients with persistent symptoms, parasites are more frequently implicated. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Bacteria'</a> below and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Viruses'</a> below and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Parasites'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=travelers-diarrhea-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment#H682385038\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Travelers' diarrhea: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;, section on 'Patients with persistent diarrhea'</a>.)</p><p>Nevertheless, the precise microbial etiology is not identified in many cases. In a series of travelers to Jamaica with travelers' diarrhea, 322 individuals had stool specimens processed, among whom an etiologic agent was identified in 32 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-microbiology-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. With use of newer diagnostic methods, identification of more causative pathogens may be possible.</p><p>Spices in food and changes in climate do <strong>not</strong> cause travelers' diarrhea, although variations in diet, temperature, or even time zones can alter the way a traveler feels, and the stresses of travel may exacerbate diarrheal symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Bacteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bacterial pathogens predominate as the cause of travelers' diarrhea. In the series of 322 patients with travelers' diarrhea cited above, ETEC accounted for 12 percent of cases due to bacteria followed by <em>Salmonella</em> spp, <em>Campylobacter jejuni</em>, and <em>Shigella</em> spp at 8, 6, and 0.3 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-microbiology-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In another study of 636 travelers to Guadalajara Mexico, Ocho Rios Jamaica, and Goa India, ETEC and enteroaggregative <em>E. coli</em> (EAEC) were responsible for the most cases at 30 and 26 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-microbiology-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The identification of EAEC, a novel pathogen at the time, in these stool specimens reduced the number of cases with an undiagnosed etiology from 51 to 37 percent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenic-escherichia-coli\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenic Escherichia coli&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other organisms (<em>Salmonella</em> spp, <em>Shigella</em> spp, <em>C. jejuni</em>, <em>Vibrio</em> spp, <em>Aeromonas hydrophila</em>, and <em>Plesiomonas shigelloides,</em> as well as rotavirus and the parasites <em>Entamoeba histolytica</em>, <em>Cryptosporidium parvum</em>, and <em>Giardia lamblia</em>) accounted for 7 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-microbiology-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Twenty percent also had infection with more than one enteric organism. Other causes of microbial food-borne illness are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-acute-infectious-diarrhea-and-other-foodborne-illnesses-in-resource-rich-settings\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of acute infectious diarrhea and other foodborne illnesses in resource-rich settings&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is some geographic variation to the microbial distribution of travelers' diarrhea. As an example, in Southeast Asia, <em>Campylobacter</em> species are the most common cause (approximately 30 percent), and non-cholera <em>Vibrio</em> species cause a sizable minority (approximately 10 percent) of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-microbiology-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>Travelers taking malaria prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-microbiology-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] or other antibiotics may also occasionally develop antibiotic-associated diarrhea due to <em>Clostridium difficile</em>. However, this is not a common cause of travelers' diarrhea.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Viruses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Viruses can also cause travelers' diarrhea. Rotaviruses are the most common among the viral pathogens, accounting for 9 percent of cases in a series from Jamaica [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-microbiology-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Norovirus has also been identified as a cause of travelers' diarrhea among international travelers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-microbiology-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rotavirus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rotavirus infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norovirus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Norovirus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Parasites</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although parasites are a less common cause of travelers' diarrhea, <em>C. parvum</em>, microsporidia, and <em>Isospora belli</em>, in addition to <em>G. lamblia</em> and <em>Cyclospora cayetanensis</em>, may contribute to diarrhea in travelers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-microbiology-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. <em>E. histolytica</em> can produce intestinal infection; it is not a common pathogen in travelers' diarrhea but can be associated with persistent diarrhea (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intestinal Entamoeba histolytica amebiasis&quot;</a>). Other parasites, such as <em>Ascaris lumbricoides</em> or <em>Strongyloides stercoralis</em>, are not usually associated with diarrheal symptoms. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1651910720\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1655787811\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk by geographic region</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overall, the incidence of travelers' diarrhea is approximately 10 to 40 percent, but the risk varies considerably based on destination of travel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-microbiology-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/1,2,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,15</a>]. The bacterial, viral, and parasitic organisms that cause travelers' diarrhea are most often transmitted by food and water, thus risk of travelers' diarrhea is the highest in regions where sanitation and hygienic practices are poor: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High risk (&gt;20 percent) &ndash; South and Southeast Asia, Africa (with the exception of South Africa), South and Central America, and Mexico</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderate risk (10 to 20 percent) &ndash; Caribbean Islands, South Africa, Central and East Asia (including Russia and China), Eastern Europe, and the Middle East, including Israel</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low risk (&lt;10 percent) &ndash; Northern and Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand, the United States, Canada, Singapore, Japan</p><p/><p>Areas with the highest risk for travelers' diarrhea include India, Nepal, and <span class=\"nowrap\">western/central</span> African countries. The risk of travelers' disease also varies with the season of the year, with a higher risk during warmer and wetter seasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-microbiology-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>Travelers should be aware that food items on aircrafts will often be obtained at the city of departure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-microbiology-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=travel-advice\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Travel advice&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1655788003\"><span class=\"h2\">Travel risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk of travelers' diarrhea is highest during the first week of travel and then progressively decreases with time. Certain activities during travel have also been associated with development of travelers' diarrhea. These include buying food from street vendors, traveling to visit friends and relatives, and staying in &quot;all-inclusive&quot; lodgings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-microbiology-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1655788034\"><span class=\"h2\">Host risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of diarrhea is related to the number of ingested organisms that reach the intestine alive. Thus, any factor which enhances the ability of bacteria to survive ingestion and transit to the intestine will increase the risk for the development of diarrheal disease. As an example, an individual who is taking histamine blockers for ulcer disease will be at increased risk for developing diarrhea since the reduction of gastric acid will allow more ingested pathogens to enter the small bowel. Similarly, an individual who has altered upper gastrointestinal (GI) anatomy (eg, after ulcer surgery, or with a blind loop syndrome) or motility may be at increased risk for the development of diarrheal disease while traveling in more contaminated environments. However, it is not clear what factors beyond exposure may influence the acquisition of viruses.</p><p>Several genetic factors have been associated with an increased risk of travelers' diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-microbiology-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Additionally, travelers from higher-risk regions are less likely to develop travelers' diarrhea when they themselves travel to other high-risk regions, suggestive of some protective immunity from prior exposure. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1655788060\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk for parasitic infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ingestion of parasites that cause diarrhea requires a more contaminated environment than is usually frequented by the average traveler. Thus, parasitic pathogens uncommonly cause travelers' diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-microbiology-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. However, there are a few locations where travelers are more likely to acquire parasites, including Nepal (where both <em>G. lamblia</em> and <em>C. cayetanensis</em> are common) and St. Petersburg (where <em>G. lamblia</em> remain hyperendemic). The mountainous regions of the West and Northeast United States are also highly endemic for <em>G. lamblia</em>, but travelers to these locations rarely request advice prior to travel. In these situations, it may be that environmental factors such as the juxtaposition of the water supply with the habitat of a certain animal species predispose the area to a hyperinfestation with the parasite.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important strategy to prevent travelers' diarrhea is prudent selection of food and drink while traveling. Water purification can be used if sanitary water is not otherwise available. Prophylactic medications (mainly antibiotics) are generally not indicated although may be useful for select travelers for whom an episode of diarrhea could have severe consequences. These are discussed in detail below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Food and drink selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Educated choices in selecting food and drinks might result in a lower incidence of diarrheal disease. Basic advice for travelers to moderate or high-risk regions for travelers' diarrhea includes eating only food that has been thoroughly cooked and served hot, fruits that the traveler peels just prior to eating, and pasteurized dairy products. Beverages should be bottled or disinfected. Bottled drinks should be requested without ice and should be drunk from the bottle with a straw rather than from a glass. Hot tea and coffee are usually safe alternatives to boiled water. </p><p>Travelers should be aware of additional observations regarding food safety and the transmission of diarrhea-causing organisms. These observations are also pertinent in expensive resorts or hotels; price does not guarantee appropriate hygiene:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Freezing does not kill the organisms that cause diarrheal disease. Thus, ice in drinks is not safe unless made from adequately boiled or filtered water.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alcohol does not sterilize water or ice; mixed drinks may still be contaminated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Outbreaks of diarrheal disease have been associated with bottled water (including carbonated water with insufficient carbonation) on rare occasions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-microbiology-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, the presence of carbonation when a bottle is opened (eg, carbonated water or soft drinks) can reassure the traveler that the drink was processed in a proper fashion and is usually safe.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fruit salads, lettuce, or chicken salads are examples of unwise food choices; the ingredients may have been improperly washed <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> may have been sitting for some time without proper refrigeration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Condiments on the table can frequently become contaminated. One study of Mexican sauces in restaurants in Guadalajara and Houston found <em>E. coli</em> in more sauces in Mexico than in Houston (66 versus 40 percent); it is important to note that significant levels of contamination was not limited to Mexico [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-microbiology-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Guacamole was the most frequently contaminated and was second only to pico de gallo for the highest colony count of bacteria.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Steam table buffets that offer the traveler a variety of foods from the local region are risky since the temperature of the food can promote the growth of bacteria.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Food provided on international airline flights can also be at risk of contamination.</p><p/><p>Although common sense would suggest that following such dietary guidance can decrease the risk of travelers' diarrhea, this has been difficult to demonstrate in formal studies. The minority of travelers are able to strictly abide by all safe food and beverage restrictions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-microbiology-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. As an example, in a series of over 30,000 travelers to Jamaica, less than 3 percent stated that they had attempted to avoid potentially high-risk foods or drinks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-microbiology-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Water purification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is usually safe to assume that the traveler will be able to find bottled water or soft drinks unless travel is to a rather remote area. Travelers who are going to be staying in rustic circumstances overseas will need to make arrangements for a safe water supply. Water can be purified in one of several ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Boiling for 3 minutes followed by cooling to room temperature (do not add ice) to kill bacteria, parasites, and viruses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adding two drops of 5 percent sodium hypochlorite (bleach) to a quart of water will kill most bacteria in 30 minutes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adding five drops of tincture of iodine to a quart of water will kill bacteria within 30 minutes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compact water filters in which the filters are impregnated with iodine remove parasitic pathogens and kill viral and bacterial pathogens; they provide a reasonable alternative for those who expect to be traveling under rustic circumstances. These are available commercially at camping or wilderness supply stores.</p><p/><p>Boiling water is usually the most palatable solution to water purification if sanitary storage is feasible. The addition of iodine or chlorine to water can impart an unpleasant taste.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Chemoprophylaxis</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2437240279\"><span class=\"h3\">Antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although antibiotics are effective in reducing the rate of travelers' diarrhea for individuals traveling from resource-rich to resource-poor areas, antibiotic chemoprophylaxis should not be used routinely for travelers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-microbiology-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Use of daily antibiotics is expensive, has potential side effects, can disrupt normal gastrointestinal flora that may be beneficial, and can promote bacterial resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-microbiology-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. For most travelers, such drawbacks are not outweighed by the prevention of a self-limiting diarrheal illness. </p><p>Antibiotic chemoprophylaxis may be considered in the setting of an underlying medical condition that would increase the risk of complications from diarrhea or would be severely exacerbated by dehydration from diarrhea such that the benefits of using antibiotic prophylaxis outweigh its risks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-microbiology-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/4,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,26</a>]. Such situations include known severe inflammatory bowel disease that could be exacerbated by an episode of infectious diarrhea; severe vascular, cardiac, or renal disease that would be seriously compromised by dehydration; or a severe immunocompromised state, such as advanced HIV disease or after a complicated organ transplant.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifaximin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rifaximin</a>, a non-absorbed antibiotic with a favorable safety profile, appears to be effective at preventing travelers' diarrhea. In a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial in Mexico, 210 American adults received either rifaximin (doses included 200 mg daily, 200 mg twice daily, or 200 mg three times daily) or placebo for two weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-microbiology-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Rifaximin at all doses reduced the rate of travelers' diarrhea (15 versus 54 percent with placebo) without excess adverse events and was associated with minimal changes in intestinal flora. Rifaximin also prevented travelers' diarrhea, although to a more moderate degree, in a randomized, double-blind trial of 258 German adults who were travelling to South or Southeast Asia for 6 to 28 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-microbiology-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. During travel and the week following, 25 percent of patients who received rifaximin (200 mg twice daily for the duration of the trip) reported symptoms consistent with travelers' diarrhea compared with 41 percent of those who received placebo. Of note, there was a trend towards lower effectiveness among travelers to Southeast Asia; this finding may be related to the decreased susceptibility to rifaximin of <em>Campylobacter</em> species, which predominate in Southeast Asia.</p><p>An expert panel has recommended against the use of fluoroquinolones for prophylaxis of travelers' diarrhea due to increasing resistance of enteric pathogens and the potential for harm to the peripheral and central nervous system, tendons, muscles, and joints from fluoroquinolones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-microbiology-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h3\">Nonantibiotic agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonantibiotic agents have also been studied for the prevention of travelers' diarrhea. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bismuth-subsalicylate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Bismuth subsalicylate</a> (30 mL or two tablets four times daily with meals) can prevent a significant number of cases of travelers' diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-microbiology-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, the doses required are inconvenient for the traveler, and salicylate toxicity is a potential complication (particularly in pregnant women, infants, and those taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> for other reasons).</p><p>The highly appealing prospect of preventing travelers' diarrhea without systemic antibiotics has fueled interest in probiotics for this purpose. However, all probiotics are not identical and results of studies done with a particular agent cannot be generalized to indicate that any probiotic agent would be successful in the same clinical situation. Probiotics such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactobacillus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lactobacillus</a> GG have been shown to decrease the incidence of diarrhea in travelers in randomized controlled trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-microbiology-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In contrast, another <em>Lactobacillus</em> preparation, nonviable <em>Lactobacillus acidophilus</em> (LA) showed no benefit compared with placebo in a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial in 174 travelers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-microbiology-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The reasons for this were unclear but could have been related to the bacteria not being viable or a particularity about the strain selected for the trial.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h2\">Vaccination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Effective vaccination to protect against travelers' diarrhea is hindered by the varied pathogens that can cause it. Although enterotoxigenic <em>E. coli</em> (ETEC) predominates as an etiology of travelers' diarrhea, vaccination strategies that have focused on this pathogen as a target have been suboptimal. </p><p>As an example, despite initial promising data on vaccination with heat-labile enterotoxin from ETEC via a skin patch, it was not effective in decreasing the incidence of moderate to severe diarrhea due to either ETEC or any cause in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial that included 1644 individuals who traveled to Mexico or Guatemala [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-microbiology-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In a subgroup analysis, the vaccine provided modest protection against ETEC that produced only heat-labile enterotoxin (vaccine efficacy 61 percent [95% CI, 7 to 84 percent]), but not ETEC that produced heat-stable toxin or both. This highlights the limitations of a single-antigen vaccine for travelers' diarrhea. </p><p>A number of trials suggest that the oral, killed whole-cell cholera vaccine, which includes a nontoxic B subunit of cholera toxin (Dukoral), provides protection for travelers against ETEC infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-microbiology-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. The rationale for such protection is that the B subunit of cholera is antigenically similar to the heat-labile enterotoxin of ETEC. In two randomized trials, this vaccine reduced the incidence of diarrhea caused by ETEC by 67 percent in a trial in Bangladesh and by 52 percent among travelers to Morocco [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-microbiology-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. However, a conservative estimate that took into account the incidence of ETEC infection throughout the world and the efficacy of the vaccine suggested that it may prevent &le;7 percent of travelers' diarrhea cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-microbiology-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Dukoral is not licensed or available in the United States. </p><p>While toxigenic <em>Vibrio cholerae</em> is a rare cause of travelers' diarrhea, sporadic but potentially life-threatening diarrhea does occur in travelers to endemic areas. A single-dose live oral cholera vaccine CVD 103-HgR (Vaxchora) is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in the United States and is recommended for adults 18 to 64 years of age who are traveling to an area of active cholera transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travelers-diarrhea-microbiology-epidemiology-and-prevention/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. This does not include all individuals traveling to countries where cholera occurs (because not all regions in each country where cholera is endemic are experiencing active transmission). However, vaccination should be considered for individuals who are at high risk for exposure, including health care workers, individuals who are traveling to provide humanitarian assistance, cholera outbreak response workers, and individuals who are traveling for extended periods to areas with active or recent cholera transmission. </p><p>The use of vaccination to prevent cholera and typhoid is discussed elsewhere.

The risk varies considerably based on destination of travel and is highest in regions where sanitation and hygienic practices are limited. Areas with the highest risk for travelers' diarrhea include India, Nepal, and <span class=\"nowrap\">western/central</span> African countries. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1651910720\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Travelers' diarrhea is an infectious illness, caused by a variety of bacterial, viral, and parasitic organisms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F62537\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62537 \">table 1</a>). Bacterial pathogens are the most frequent cause in acute cases. The most common organism overall is enterotoxigenic <em>Escherichia coli</em> (ETEC), but there is some geographic variation. As an example, in Southeast Asia, <em>Campylobacter</em> species predominate. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most important strategy to prevent travelers' diarrhea is prudent selection of food and drink while traveling. Basic advice includes eating only food that has been thoroughly cooked and served hot, fruits that the traveler peels just prior to eating, and pasteurized dairy products. Beverages should be bottled. Water purification can be used if sanitary water is not otherwise available. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Food and drink selection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Water purification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For individuals traveling from resource-rich to resource-limited settings, we suggest not routinely administering chemoprophylaxis to prevent travelers' diarrhea (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). While effective, agents used for chemoprophylaxis have known and potential drawbacks that outweigh the benefit of preventing a self-limited illness. However, chemoprophylaxis is reasonable for travelers with underlying medical conditions that increase the risk of complications from diarrhea or would be severely exacerbated by dehydration from diarrhea (eg, inflammatory bowel disease, serious cardiovascular disease, immunocompromised state). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to advice about prudent food and beverage choices, travelers who present for a pre-travel evaluation should be counseled on self-diagnosis and treatment of travelers' diarrhea. This is discussed in detail elsewhere.
