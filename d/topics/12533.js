Additional PFTs, such as measurement of maximal respiratory pressures, flow-volume loops, submaximal exercise testing, and bronchoprovocation challenge, are useful in specific clinical circumstances (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F106178\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106178 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>In preparation for PFTs, bronchodilator medications are typically held so that bronchodilator response can be assessed after baseline spirometry. As examples, short-acting inhaled bronchodilators (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albuterol</a>, salbutamol, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=formoterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">formoterol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipratropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipratropium</a>) should not be used for four hours prior to testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Long-acting beta-agonist bronchodilators (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salmeterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">salmeterol</a>, formoterol) are typically held for 12 hours prior to testing. The ultra long-acting beta agonists (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indacaterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indacaterol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olodaterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olodaterol</a>, vilanterol) and the long-acting anticholinergic agents <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycopyrrolate-glycopyrronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glycopyrrolate</a> (glycopyrronium), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tiotropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tiotropium</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=umeclidinium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">umeclidinium</a> are held for 24 hours. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aclidinium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Aclidinium</a> would be held for 12 hours, based on twice daily dosing. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Spirometry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spirometry, the most readily available and useful pulmonary function test, measures the volume of air exhaled at specific time points during a forceful and complete exhalation after a maximal inhalation. The total exhaled volume, known as the forced vital capacity (FVC), the volume exhaled in the first second, known as the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), and their ratio (FEV<sub>1</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FVC)</span> are the most important variables reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The test takes 10 to 15 minutes and carries minimal risk (eg, rarely syncope). The technique for performing spirometry and interpretation of results are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=office-spirometry\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Office spirometry&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flow-volume-loops\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flow-volume loops&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Spirometry is a key diagnostic test for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (when performed before and after bronchodilator) and is useful to assess for asthma or other causes of airflow obstruction in the evaluation of chronic cough. It is also used to monitor a broad spectrum of respiratory diseases, including asthma, COPD, interstitial lung disease, and neuromuscular diseases affecting respiratory muscles. </p><p>The slow vital capacity (SVC) can also be measured with spirometers which collect data for at least 30 seconds. The SVC may be a useful measurement when the FVC is reduced and airway obstruction is present. Slow exhalation results in a lesser degree of airway narrowing, and the patient may produce a larger, even normal vital capacity. In contrast, the vital capacity with restrictive disease is reduced during both slow and fast maneuvers. Thus, if the slow or forced vital capacity is within the normal range, it is generally unnecessary to measure static lung volumes (residual volume and total lung capacity) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H281210450\"><span class=\"h3\">Post-bronchodilator</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Performance of spirometry before and after bronchodilator is used to determine the degree of reversibility of airflow limitation. Administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albuterol</a> by metered-dose inhaler (MDI) is indicated if baseline spirometry demonstrates airway obstruction or if one suspects asthma or COPD. Albuterol (4 inhalations of 90 to 100 mcg) or an equivalent short-acting beta agonist is administered by metered dose inhaler with a spacer or chamber device (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F74135\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74135 \">picture 1</a>); proper MDI technique is important to prevent false negative results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Spirometry should be repeated 10 to 15 minutes after administration of a bronchodilator. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The use of inhaler devices in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In a patient with airway obstruction, an increase in the FEV<sub>1</sub> of more than 12 percent and greater than 0.2 L suggests acute bronchodilator responsiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In patients with asthma, bronchodilator administration often results in improvement, and in some patients with asthma, post-bronchodilator testing may improve to normal spirometry values. Among patients with COPD, administration of bronchodilator sometimes leads to a significant change in FEV<sub>1</sub>, but reversal to normal spirometry rules out a diagnosis of COPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Bronchodilators may also lead to improvement in flow in the small airways and a reduction in air trapping. While criteria for assessment of reduced air trapping have not been formalized, an increase in inspiratory capacity (IC) and a decrease in functional residual capacity (FRC) are thought to reflect this response. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Lung volumes'</a> below.)</p><p>Sometimes, patients will note subjective improvements in their breathing after bronchodilator inhalation, but without associated changes in FVC or FEV<sub>1 </sub>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. It is thought that increased airflow within the tidal volume range, but not during deep inhalation may account for this discrepancy. Deep inhalations are associated with airway narrowing, which may offset the measured bronchodilator response. Thus, the lack of an acute bronchodilator response on spirometry should not preclude a one to eight week therapeutic trial of bronchodilators <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inhaled glucocorticoids, with reassessment of clinical status and change in FEV<sub>1</sub> at the end of that time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Flow-volume loop</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Flow-volume loops, which include forced inspiratory and expiratory maneuvers, are performed whenever stridor is heard over the neck and for evaluation of unexplained dyspnea. Airway obstruction located in the pharynx, larynx, or trachea (upper airways) is usually impossible to detect from standard FVC maneuvers. Reproducible forced inspiratory vital capacity (FIVC) maneuvers may detect variable extrathoracic upper airway obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], as can be seen with vocal fold paralysis or dysfunction, which causes a characteristic limitation of flow (plateau) during forced inhalation but little if any obstruction during exhalation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76811\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76811 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flow-volume-loops\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flow-volume loops&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion#H19239745\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paradoxical vocal fold motion&quot;, section on 'Pulmonary function tests'</a>.)</p><p>Less commonly, a fixed upper airway obstruction (UAO) (eg, tracheal stenosis) causes flow limitation during both forced inhalation and forced exhalation maneuvers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76811\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76811 \">figure 1</a>). However, the flow-volume loop is not sensitive for detecting a fixed UAO, since the tracheal lumen is often reduced to less than 1 cm before a plateau is recognized. Poor effort mimics the flow-volume loop shapes of upper airway obstruction, but can be excluded when three or more maneuvers are seen to be reproducible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2273434927\"><span class=\"h3\">Bronchoprovocation challenge</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spirometry is used to assess the airway hyperresponsiveness to a variety of bronchoprovocation challenges, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a>, histamine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a>, and isocapnic hyperpnea. Bronchoprovocation challenge is discussed separately.

Diaphragmatic weakness is suggested by a decrease in the supine VC &gt;10 percent. Unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis is usually associated with a decrease in VC of 15 to 25 percent; bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis can be associated with a decrease in supine VC approaching 50 percent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-bilateral-diaphragmatic-paralysis#H26028698\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis&quot;, section on 'Pulmonary function tests and arterial blood gases'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-unilateral-diaphragmatic-paralysis-and-eventration-in-adults#H17481185\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis and eventration in adults&quot;, section on 'Pulmonary function'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Lung volumes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measurement of lung volumes is important when spirometry shows a decreased forced vital capacity. Body plethysmography is the gold standard for measurement of lung volumes, particularly in the setting of significant airflow obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Alternative methods include helium dilution, nitrogen washout, and measurements based on chest imaging. Helium dilution and nitrogen washout may underestimate lung volume in patients with moderate to severe COPD because they do not access under or nonventilated areas. </p><p>Measurements of total lung capacity (TLC) using the chest radiograph or high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) correlate within 15 percent of those obtained by body plethysmography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-adults/abstract/4,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,11</a>]. Since the TLC is equivalent to the amount of air seen in the lungs on a chest radiograph taken at maximal inspiration, it is important that the subject inhales maximally as the image is created.</p><p>Common lung volume measurements include vital capacity, total lung capacity, functional residual capacity, and residual volume. By convention, the term capacity is used for compartments composed of two or more volumes. The relationships among the lung volumes and capacities are shown in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55440\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55440 \">figure 2</a>) and listed below: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vital capacity (VC): maximum volume exhaled after maximum inspiration; can be measured during forced exhalation (FVC) or slow exhalation (SVC)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Functional residual capacity (FRC): volume of air remaining in chest at the end of a tidal volume breath</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Residual volume (RV): volume of air remaining in chest after maximal exhalation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expiratory reserve volume (ERV): volume of air exhaled from end-tidal volume (FRC) to point of maximal exhalation (RV), so RV plus ERV = FRC</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inspiratory capacity (IC): maximum inspiration from end-tidal volume (FRC) to total lung capacity </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Total lung capacity (TLC): volume of air in lungs at end of maximal inspiration (usually calculated by RV plus VC or FRC plus IC) &#160;</p><p/><p>A schema for the interpretation of PFT results is provided in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F96311\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef96311 \">algorithm 1</a>). VC and TLC are the key lung volumes for determining restriction, defined as VC and TLC values less than 5<sup>th</sup> percentile of predicted (roughly and imperfectly approximated by values less than 80 percent of predicted); a reduced VC alone is not sufficient evidence of restriction because it can be caused by air trapping due to severe obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Air trapping is indicated when the FRC or RV is increased (&gt;120 percent of predicted); hyperinflation is indicated when the TLC is increased (&gt;120 percent predicted). Thus, in the setting of COPD with obstruction on spirometry and a low vital capacity, measurement of lung volumes can help determine if there is a superimposed restrictive disorder or if VC is decreased due to air trapping or hyperinflation. </p><p>The combination of an FEV<sub>1</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FVC</span> and TLC both less than the fifth percentile lower limit of normal is considered a mixed defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The combination of a normal FEV<sub>1</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FVC</span> and a normal TLC and a low FEV<sub>1</sub> or FVC is considered the nonspecific pattern. The pattern in which the FVC is disproportionately reduced relative to TLC has been described as the complex restrictive pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Maximal respiratory pressures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measurement of maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures is indicated whenever there is an unexplained decrease in vital capacity or respiratory muscle weakness is suspected clinically. Maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), measured at RV, is the maximal pressure that can be produced by the patient trying to inhale through a blocked mouthpiece after a full exhalation. Maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) is the maximal pressure measured during forced expiration (with cheeks bulging) through a blocked mouthpiece after a full inhalation (TLC). Repeated measurements of MIP and MEP are useful in following the course of patients with neuromuscular disorders. The slow vital capacity may also be followed, but it is less specific and usually less sensitive. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tests of respiratory muscle strength&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures are easily measured using a simple mechanical pressure gauge connected to a mouthpiece. MIP measures the ability of the diaphragm and the other respiratory muscles to generate inspiratory force, reflected by a negative airway pressure. The average MIP and MEP for adult men are -100 and +170 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, respectively, while the corresponding values for adult women are about -70 and +110 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-adults/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. The lower limit of the normal range is about two-thirds of these values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

The technique and interpretation are discussed separately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-adults/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diffusing-capacity-for-carbon-monoxide#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide&quot;, section on 'Methodology'</a>.)</p><p>In the setting of restrictive disease, the diffusing capacity helps distinguish between intrinsic lung disease, in which DLCO is usually reduced, and other causes of restriction, in which DLCO is usually normal. In the setting of obstructive disease, the DLCO helps distinguish between emphysema and other causes of chronic airway obstruction. The DLCO is also used in the assessment of pulmonary vascular disease (eg, thromboembolic disease, pulmonary hypertension), which typically causes a reduction in DLCO in the absence of significant restriction or obstruction. (See <a href=\"#H224258866\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary vascular disease'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diffusing-capacity-for-carbon-monoxide\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26338868\"><span class=\"h2\">Submaximal exercise testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Submaximal exercise testing is often conducted in the pulmonary function laboratory and does not require the resources needed for a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-adults/abstract/3,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,17</a>]. Three commonly used submaximal tests are the six-minute walk test, the incremental shuttle walk test, and the endurance shuttle walk test. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing is discussed separately.

As an example, emphysema lowers the DLCO, obstructive chronic bronchitis does not affect the DLCO, and asthma frequently increases the DLCO. Changes in the DLCO in patients with established, smoking-related COPD are probably not clinically useful during follow-up visits, unless dyspnea suddenly worsens without an obvious cause.

However, patients with mild interstitial lung disease (ILD) may have normal values for FVC and TLC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. </p><p>In ILD, the DLCO is decreased by diffuse alveolar capillary damage, and the measured alveolar volume (VA) is low due to the loss of aerated alveoli.

By comparison, in patients with restrictive physiology due to incomplete lung expansion (eg, neuromuscular disease or kyphoscoliosis), the DLCO is relatively preserved, and the reduction in DLCO is proportionately less than the reduction in VA, so the ratio <span class=\"nowrap\">DLCO/VA</span> (KCO) is actually increased.

The degree of airways obstruction (or an elevated arterial tension of carbon dioxide [PaCO<sub>2</sub>] for patients with COPD) predicts the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications, such as atelectasis, pneumonia, and the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation. If spirometry demonstrates moderate to severe obstruction and the surgery can be delayed, a prophylactic program of pulmonary hygiene, including smoking cessation, inhaled bronchodilators or glucocorticoids, and possibly antibiotics for bronchitis, will reduce the risk. However, the results of spirometry alone should not be used to deny surgery. Combining the results of spirometry with radioisotope or CT lung scans is also useful for predicting the remaining lung function following a lobectomy or pneumonectomy.

An increase in the FEV<sub>1</sub> of more than 12 percent and greater than 0.2 L suggests bronchodilator responsiveness; full return to normal values for FEV<sub>1</sub> and FEV<sub>1</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FVC</span> suggests asthma. Partial improvement is consistent with asthma, COPD, or bronchiolitis. The lack of a bronchodilator response should not preclude a therapeutic trial of bronchodilators <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inhaled glucocorticoids. (See <a href=\"#H281210450\" class=\"local\">'Post-bronchodilator'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measurement of lung volumes complements spirometry (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F96311\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef96311 \">algorithm 1</a>). Common measurements include total lung capacity (TLC), functional residual capacity (FRC), and residual volume (RV). Decreased lung volumes suggest restrictive disease if accompanied by a normal or increased FEV<sub>1</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FVC</span> ratio. Increased lung volumes suggest static hyperinflation due to obstructive airways disease if accompanied by decreased FEV<sub>1</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FVC</span> ratio. Coexisting restriction and obstruction can be identified when the TLC and FEV<sub>1</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FVC</span> ratio are reduced. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Lung volumes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measurement of diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) assesses gas exchange. A decreased DLCO accompanied by restrictive disease suggests intrinsic lung disease, whereas a normal DLCO accompanied by restrictive disease suggests a non-pulmonary cause of restriction. A markedly decreased DLCO accompanied by obstructive airways disease suggests emphysema. A reduced DLCO with normal lung volumes suggests possible pulmonary vascular disease. (See <a href=\"#H91879305\" class=\"local\">'Diffusing capacity'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diffusing-capacity-for-carbon-monoxide\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measurement of maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures detects respiratory muscle weakness. Maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) is the maximal pressure that can be produced by the patient trying to inhale through a blocked mouthpiece. Maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) is the maximal pressure measured during forced expiration through a blocked mouthpiece after a full inhalation. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Maximal respiratory pressures'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tests of respiratory muscle strength&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment of pulse oxygen saturation at rest or with exertion can be used to identify a gas exchange defect and to titrate the amount of oxygen needed to maintain adequate oxygenation. A clear consensus has not been reached about the value for resting oximetry that differentiates normal and abnormal. At sea level, values for pulse oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) &le;95 percent are generally considered abnormal, although a decrease to 96 percent in a patient who has previous values of 99 to 100 percent could be abnormal. Exertional decreases in SpO<sub>2</sub> &ge;5 percentage points are also considered abnormal. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Pulse oxygen saturation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulse-oximetry\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulse oximetry&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21898629\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Paul Enright, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Crapo RO.
