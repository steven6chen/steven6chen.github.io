Chromosomes are structures in cells that contain thousands of genes. Chromosome problems usually happen by chance. But sometimes they happen because the mother or father has a chromosome problem. They also happen more often in older mothers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conditions in which something changes the shape of the inside of the uterus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80271\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80271 \">figure 1</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An autoimmune condition in the mother &ndash; When a woman has an autoimmune condition, her infection-fighting system attacks healthy tissue in her body instead of infections.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other medical conditions in the mother &ndash; Some of these include diabetes, thyroid disease, blood clotting problems, or hormone problems.</p><p/><p>In many cases, though, doctors don't know why repeated miscarriage happens.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6251857\"><span class=\"h1\">How will my doctor figure out why I am having repeated miscarriage?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To figure out why you are having repeated miscarriage, your doctor will:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Talk with you and ask about your past pregnancies, monthly periods, and medical conditions</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do an exam, including a pelvic exam</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do blood tests &ndash; These include tests to check your immune system, blood clotting system, and hormone levels.

But you might be able to lower your chances of having one by avoiding cigarettes, alcohol, caffeine, and other drugs or medicines not prescribed by a doctor or nurse. You can also try to stay at a healthy weight. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6251904\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I be able to have a baby someday?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women who have repeated miscarriage are able to have a baby in the future.</p><p>Let your doctor know when you are planning to become pregnant and then as soon as you think you are pregnant. Your doctor will be able to monitor your pregnancy to make sure it is developing normally.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6251919\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I get support if I'm having a hard time coping?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Having repeated miscarriage can be very tough.
