Food allergy is an abnormal immune reaction consisting of hypersensitivity to food components, most commonly proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-food-allergy/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>This topic will focus on food allergy due to primary sensitization through the gut and will review organization of the gut immune system and factors that influence oral tolerance induction. Theories addressing the increasing prevalence of food allergy are briefly mentioned. The pathogenesis of pollen-food allergy syndrome, seen more frequently in adolescents and adults, is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of oral allergy syndrome (pollen-food allergy syndrome)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of food allergies, particularly to peanut, appears to have increased from the late 1990s to the early 2010s (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F54092\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54092 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-food-allergy/abstract/4-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-9</a>]. While there are a number of theories regarding the apparent increase in prevalence of food allergies, especially peanut allergy, definitive answers are still lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-food-allergy/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. Postulated hypotheses have focused on hygiene, dietary fat, antioxidants, vitamin D, and dual allergen exposure (ie, initial exposure to a food allergen via a nonoral route, such as the skin). There are some data in support of these hypotheses to explain the increasing risk of asthma and allergic rhinitis. However, there are limited data regarding the role for these hypotheses in the increased prevalence of food allergy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food allergy in children: Prevalence, natural history, and monitoring for resolution&quot;, section on 'Prevalence of childhood food allergy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hygiene hypothesis &ndash; Early life exposure to infectious pathogens, as well as normal gut microbiota, may influence the development of the immune system away from a T helper type 2 (Th2) and towards a T regulatory cell (Treg) response. Better hygiene, resulting in less microbial exposure, may lead to an increase in atopic disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Microbiome depletion hypothesis &ndash; This hypothesis evolved from the hygiene hypothesis. The ecosystem of the human body (the human biome) can influence immune function. Loss of species diversity from the human microbiome can result in allergy, autoimmune disease, and other disorders related to increased inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-food-allergy/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Short chain fatty acid hypothesis &ndash; A specific microbiome may promote a high concentration of short chain fatty acid such as butyrate, propionate, or acetate, which may contribute to a decreased sensitization to foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-food-allergy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dietary fat hypothesis &ndash; This hypothesis postulates that decreased consumption of n-3 fatty acids (eg, omega-3 fatty acids) and increased ingestion of n-6 fatty acids (eg, vegetable oils) leads to greater production of immunoglobulin E (IgE) through the influence of prostaglandin-E2.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antioxidant hypothesis &ndash; This hypothesis argues that antioxidants found in fresh fruits and vegetables, such as vitamin C and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-carotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">beta-carotene</a>, have protective anti-inflammatory effects. Dietary patterns that include more processed foods and less fresh produce may therefore increase susceptibility to allergy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vitamin D hypothesis &ndash; Vitamin D has been shown to have immunomodulatory effects. Proposed but unproven theories suggest a role for both vitamin D excess and deficiency in the development of allergic disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d-and-extraskeletal-health\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vitamin D and extraskeletal health&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dual allergen exposure hypothesis &ndash; This theory proposes that sensitization to a food is more likely to occur in a young child if the initial exposures are low dose and via the cutaneous route rather than high dose and via the gut. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Primary sensitization'</a> below and <a href=\"#H32\" class=\"local\">'Route of antigen exposure'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Food processing hypothesis &ndash; How foods are processed may also affect allergenicity. This can lead to varying prevalence in different cultures. As an example, roasting and emulsification of peanut to make peanut butter may alter the proteins and allow them to be presented to the immune system in a manner that may be conducive to promoting allergic responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-food-allergy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Rates of peanut allergy are lower in countries where peanuts are primarily boiled rather than roasted. (See <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Antigen form'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other hypotheses &ndash; <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>-derived enterotoxins commonly cause food contamination. Staphylococcal superantigens are also associated with atopic dermatitis. In a mouse model, oral administration of staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) along with egg or peanut antigen results in Th2-polarized responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-food-allergy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Similarly, SEB may also favor sensitivity when added to a skin-sensitizing antigen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-food-allergy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Oral challenge with allergen triggers anaphylaxis. Expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and Tregs is impaired. Feeding high doses of antigen restores tolerance.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF REACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Food allergy reactions may be immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated, non-IgE mediated, or both. It was previously thought that the development of food allergy was due to a skewed T helper type 2 (Th2)-allergic response. However, it is now recognized that the failure of regulatory mechanisms may also play a critical role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-food-allergy/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Effector T cells'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most immediate-type reactions are mediated by food-specific IgE antibodies, eliciting acute or chronic cutaneous symptoms (ie, contributing to eczema flares) or anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-food-allergy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. IgE-mediated reactions are more prevalent in young children and can be outgrown during childhood. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food allergy in children: Prevalence, natural history, and monitoring for resolution&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Non-IgE mediated</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Non-immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food allergy (usually delayed Th2 cell-mediated responses) is mostly manifested by gastrointestinal symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> occasionally by chronic skin symptoms. The absence of reliable testing for non-IgE-mediated food allergy has obscured a clear view of the pathogenesis of these diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-food-allergy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The increased prevalence of eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders has led to new insights into the pathogenesis of these diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-food-allergy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Mixed</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Food allergies associated with several diseases, such as eosinophilic esophagitis, food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES), and atopic dermatitis, are not always attributable exclusively to IgE- or non-IgE-mediated mechanisms but may be due to mixed processes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-allergy-in-atopic-dermatitis-eczema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of allergy in atopic dermatitis (eczema)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">THE GUT IMMUNE SYSTEM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The gut is the largest mucosal organ of the body and, as such, is at the forefront of the body's immune homeostasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-food-allergy/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. The gut immune system is comprised of luminal barriers, gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), and lymphoid organs. The gut is exposed to pathogenic and commensal micro-organisms on a daily basis. In addition, it is exposed to a large amount of ingested foreign dietary proteins. The immune system in and around the gut has developed to provide a tolerogenic response to nonpathogenic proteins. Tolerance is accomplished through two primary mechanisms: preventing the uptake of intact allergens and limiting the proallergenic damaging immune responses to undegraded antigens that do enter the system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-food-allergy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview of components and functions</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Luminal barriers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The luminal barriers of the gut include secreted factors and physical gut components comprising the epithelial layer and luminal contents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-food-allergy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastric acid and intestinal proteolytic enzymes degrade potentially allergenic proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-food-allergy/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunoglobulin A (IgA) produced by B cells in the gut binds foreign proteins and peptides in the gut lumen, preventing their uptake.

M cells are enterocytes expressing major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II that endocytose particulate antigens and transport them to antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the underlying tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-food-allergy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Other components</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The vasculature of the lamina propria and Peyer's patches allows inflammatory cells to circulate to other immune structures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mesenteric lymph nodes are the closest lymph nodes for filtering antigens absorbed through the gut.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The spleen and the liver are lymphoid organs that are important components of the immune response to potentially harmful proteins that enter through the gut. The role of the liver as a contributor to the memory of food allergy has become apparent by reports of nonallergic recipients developing peanut allergy after transplantation of a liver from peanut-allergic individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-food-allergy/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">ROUTES OF ALLERGEN SENSITIZATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sensitization to a food may occur directly through the gut or skin.

These food allergens are generally stable to digestion.</p><p>Sensitization to allergens may also occur through the cutaneous route [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-food-allergy/abstract/39-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-48</a>]. This was first demonstrated in murine and canine models and later in humans. Epicutaneous sensitization prevents oral tolerance and induces a systemic T helper type 2 (Th2) response. Exposure to antigen through the skin may predispose to development of diseases such as atopic dermatitis and eosinophilic esophagitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Allergen cross-reactivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most frequent clinical manifestation of food allergy in older children and adults is oral allergy syndrome, or pollen-food allergy syndrome. Patients suffering from oral allergy syndrome are primarily sensitized to respiratory allergens such as birch, grass, or mugwort pollens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-food-allergy/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Secondarily, they develop clinical reactivity to homologous epitopes on food proteins of plant origin. These food allergens are generally labile and are destroyed during digestion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of oral allergy syndrome (pollen-food allergy syndrome)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTIGEN UPTAKE AND PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dietary proteins are degraded into small peptides and amino acids by gastric acid and intestinal and pancreatic enzymes. In most cases, the digested peptides no longer bear the potentially immunogenic epitopes of the original protein. In addition, secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA) molecules in the gut lumen bind proteins and block absorption. However, some intact proteins and allergenic epitopes slip through these barriers and are taken up by specialized cells in the gastrointestinal tract and transported to antigen-presenting cells (APCs).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Antigen uptake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antigens may be taken up from the gut lumen by three cell types (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F67348\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67348 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-food-allergy/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intestinal epithelial cells &ndash; Soluble food proteins can be taken up by intestinal epithelial cells through endocytosis by the microvillus membrane. Alternatively, they may cross the epithelium through a paracellular route [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-food-allergy/abstract/2,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,50</a>].

Dendritic cells are predominantly localized in the lamina propria of peripheral tissues, where they uptake antigens. They then migrate to effector sites, including the follicles of Peyer's patches or mesenteric lymph nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-food-allergy/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Dendritic cells then present antigenic peptides complexed with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) to T cell receptors on CD4+ T cells. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antigen-presenting-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antigen-presenting cells&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Various costimulatory molecules, such as CD80 and CD86, provide essential signals for efficient antigen presentation and initiation of the immune response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-food-allergy/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Other cell surface molecules, including T cell immunoglobulin-domain and mucin-domain 4 (TIM-4, or TIMD-4) and OX40 ligand (OX40L or CD252), are expressed by dendritic cells in mouse models. These molecules also promote T helper type 2 (Th2) differentiation and may be involved in the development of Th2-mediated food hypersensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-food-allergy/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>].</p><p>Intestinal epithelial cells constitutively express MHC II and may also act as nonprofessional APCs.

Their specific characteristics are most likely due to their proximity to the strong immunogenic stimuli of the gut microbiota [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-food-allergy/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>IELs constitute a unique population of T cells.

Both CD8 alpha-alpha+ and gamma-delta T cells recognize antigen independently of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I. The exact function of these cells is still unknown.
