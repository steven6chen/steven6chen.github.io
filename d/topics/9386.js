Surgical staging is potentially more accurate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-cancer-staging-and-evaluation-of-lymph-nodes/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) has determined that clinical staging is preferable for several reasons: it is more accessible for low-resource settings, in which cervical cancer remains the most common malignancy among women; it may be better for assessing locally advanced disease (ie, tumor size, vaginal and parametrial involvement); and it avoids surgery in women who are not candidates for surgical treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-cancer-staging-and-evaluation-of-lymph-nodes/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Tumor stage is determined at the time of primary diagnosis of cervical cancer and is not altered, even upon recurrence. This convention also applies to other gynecologic cancers. Accurate pretreatment staging of cervical cancer is critical, as it determines therapy (ie, surgery, chemoradiation, chemotherapy alone) and prognosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F64747\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64747 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The staging and evaluation of lymph nodes for cervical cancer will be reviewed here.

Thus, a good pelvic examination by an experienced examiner is of critical importance. Rarely does it need to be performed under anesthesia.</p><p>Cervical cancer spreads locally by extension to the uterine corpus, vagina, and parametria. Thus, the cervix and entire vagina should be inspected and palpated to identify overt tumors or subepithelial vaginal extension. Vaginal extension is diagnosed with visual inspection; biopsy is not typically required. Tumor size and parametrial involvement are best assessed by rectovaginal examination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=invasive-cervical-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H1087317\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Invasive cervical cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Routes of spread'</a>.) </p><p>Cervical biopsy may have been performed as part of an initial evaluation or along with the staging procedure, depending on the level of suspicion of malignancy. The approach to cervical biopsy (eg, colposcopy with directed biopsy or conization) differs depending upon the patient&rsquo;s presentation, findings on pelvic examination, and the patient&rsquo;s access to health care. Usually, once a biopsy confirms invasive disease, repeat biopsy or cervical conization procedure is not necessary unless the conization is part of treatment (eg, a stage IA1 cancer being treated definitively with cone biopsy). Approaches to cervical biopsy for varying presentations (ie, visible lesion, abnormal cytology) are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=invasive-cervical-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H1087497\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Invasive cervical cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Cervical biopsy and colposcopy'</a>.) </p><p>Hysteroscopy, cystoscopy, and proctoscopy can be used to assess adjacent areas. Suspicious lesions should be confirmed by biopsy.</p><p>The limitations of clinical staging are well appreciated. Parametrial and sidewall invasion, as well as metastases to lymph nodes, can be difficult to assess accurately using the tests listed above. This leads to understaging of some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-cancer-staging-and-evaluation-of-lymph-nodes/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Clinical staging appears to perform best for microscopic or late-stage disease, but less well for the stages that depend largely upon assessment of tumor size or local spread [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-cancer-staging-and-evaluation-of-lymph-nodes/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Based upon international data from over 13,000 women with cervical cancer, the correlation between clinical staging and surgicopathologic findings reached 90 percent or higher only for stage IA1 (microscopic disease) and stages IIIB and IVA (tumor extends to pelvic sidewall, hydronephrosis, or <span class=\"nowrap\">bladder/rectal</span> invasion) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113542\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113542 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-cancer-staging-and-evaluation-of-lymph-nodes/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. For other stages, the correlation between clinical and surgical stage ranged from 66 to 83 percent.</p><p>For these reasons, additional testing modalities are used to evaluate women with cervical cancer, where available, and the results of these tests are used for planning treatment; FIGO-sanctioned studies alone are used in the minority of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-cancer-staging-and-evaluation-of-lymph-nodes/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>]. However, the majority of oncologists still report their data based upon the FIGO system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">FURTHER EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical staging system for cervical cancer is limited to the specified set of examinations and does not assess the full extent of disease in all women. In particular, evaluation with imaging studies, surgical procedures, and laboratory evaluation is routinely used to detect the presence and impact of lymph node metastases and distant metastases.</p><p>The results of these examinations <strong>do not</strong> alter the stage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-cancer-staging-and-evaluation-of-lymph-nodes/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. The only exception to this is the assessment of hydronephrosis or hydroureter, which is now commonly assessed with imaging studies other than the modality specified by FIGO (ie, intravenous pyelography [IVP]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-cancer-staging-and-evaluation-of-lymph-nodes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The information provided by additional examinations is important in making treatment decisions. An overview of the typical treatment of cervical cancer is helpful to inform this discussion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113542\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113542 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-cancer-staging-and-evaluation-of-lymph-nodes/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Selected women with microscopic disease (stage IA1) may be treated with extrafascial hysterectomy, cone biopsy, or simple trachelectomy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with a tumor that is confined to the cervix, uterus, or upper third of the vagina (stage IA2, IB1, IIA1) that is nonbulky (&le;4 cm) and who do not have lymph node metastases are candidates for radical hysterectomy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with local extension (eg, to the low two-thirds of the vagina, parametrium, or bladder) that is bulky (stage IB2, IIA2 to IVA) or with lymph node metastases are generally treated with chemoradiation.

In our practice, we use the following approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women who are candidates for radical hysterectomy (stages IA2 and IB1):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We assess the tumor size and vaginal and parametrial involvement by clinical examination alone. If there is uncertainty about tumor size <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> local spread following the clinical examination, some clinicians evaluate the patient with pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We order preoperative <span class=\"nowrap\">abdominal/pelvic</span> computed tomography (CT) to exclude obvious lymph node metastases and distant metastasis. If the nodes appear benign, we proceed with surgery. If the CT findings are suspicious for lymph node metastases, there are two commonly used options for further evaluation: (1) in our practice, we refer for a CT- or ultrasound-guided node biopsy, or (2) other clinicians commonly use positron emission tomography (PET) for further evaluation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women with lymph node metastases on imaging-guided biopsy or PET, some clinicians treat based upon these findings and others perform laparoscopic pelvic and paraaortic lymph node dissection to debulk enlarged nodes and provide further information to determine the radiation fields. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Surgical evaluation of lymph nodes'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with locally advanced disease (stages IB2 to IVA) for whom primary chemoradiation is planned:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Prior to treatment, we obtain a <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> to evaluate extent of disease with particular attention to lymph node metastases to provide information to design radiation fields. If the <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> shows widely metastatic disease, we treat with full-dose chemotherapy rather than chemoradiation. Some radiation oncologists will add MRI for treatment planning, particularly if there is concern for rectum or bladder involvement.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Tumor size and local spread</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is controversial whether imaging studies are more useful than clinical examination alone to assess tumor size and local spread in women with cervical cancer. If imaging is used, MRI is the modality of choice.</p><p>For women who are surgical candidates based upon clinical staging, some data suggest that tumor size can be determined more effectively with MRI than clinical examination. As an example, a prospective study included 208 women, most with stage IB disease, who underwent MRI and CT prior to surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-cancer-staging-and-evaluation-of-lymph-nodes/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. MRI correlated more closely with surgicopathologic findings than CT or physical examination. All three modalities overestimated tumor size. This is an important observation, as overestimation of tumor size in surgical candidates likely would not change treatment or prognosis, while underestimation of size would potentially triage a patient to surgical excision when chemoradiation would be the best option.</p><p>Determining the presence of parametrial spread is also of critical importance for determining whether patients are candidates for surgical treatment. Data conflict regarding whether imaging studies are better able to detect parametrial spread than clinical staging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-cancer-staging-and-evaluation-of-lymph-nodes/abstract/7,13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,13-16</a>]. Imaging studies performed better than clinical staging in one study, a prospective multicenter study in which 172 women with cervical cancer who were clinically staged as IB or higher underwent CT and MRI prior to surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-cancer-staging-and-evaluation-of-lymph-nodes/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Detection of stage IIB or higher was poor for all approaches, but imaging studies performed better than clinical staging: clinical staging (sensitivity: 29 percent and specificity: 99 percent), CT (42 and 82 percent), and MRI (53 and 74 percent). By contrast, a retrospective study found clinical staging to be superior to CT and MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-cancer-staging-and-evaluation-of-lymph-nodes/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In that study, the sensitivity and specificity for detection of parametrial involvement (stage IIB) was: clinical staging (sensitivity: 66 percent and specificity: 81 percent), CT (43 and 71 percent), and MRI (52 and 63 percent).</p><p>If an imaging study is used for parametrial assessment, we suggest MRI. MRI was found to be superior to CT for evaluation of parametrial involvement in a meta-analysis of 57 studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-cancer-staging-and-evaluation-of-lymph-nodes/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. There are few data regarding the use of <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> for the evaluation of tumor size or local spread in cervical cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-cancer-staging-and-evaluation-of-lymph-nodes/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Further study is required.</p><p>In locally advanced cervical cancer (stages IB2 to IVA), correlation of tumor size by physical examination with imaging studies is difficult to estimate since those patients typically undergo definitive chemoradiation therapy, making pathologic examination and measurement of true tumor size impossible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Lymph node metastases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical cancer may spread to the pelvic or paraortic lymph nodes, as well as more distal nodes. The presence of lymph node involvement is associated with a worse prognosis and impacts decisions regarding the radiotherapy field [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-cancer-staging-and-evaluation-of-lymph-nodes/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=invasive-cervical-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H1087317\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Invasive cervical cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Routes of spread'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-locally-advanced-cervical-cancer#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of locally advanced cervical cancer&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-early-stage-cervical-cancer#H618915858\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of early-stage cervical cancer&quot;, section on 'Treatment of high-risk disease'</a>.)</p><p>Historically, surgery with lymphadenectomy was required to evaluate for lymph node metastases. Currently, options for evaluating for lymph node metastases include lymph node dissection, imaging studies, or both.</p><p>Initial evaluation of lymph nodes is commonly performed with CT to minimize expense, but PET and <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> are the imaging modalities used to provide information for treatment decisions. These studies have largely replaced MRI and lymphangiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-cancer-staging-and-evaluation-of-lymph-nodes/abstract/21-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-25</a>].</p><p>Integrated <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> imaging is a technique in which both PET and CT are performed sequentially during a single visit on a hybrid <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> scanner. The PET and CT images are then coregistered using fusion software, enabling the physiologic data obtained on PET to be localized according to the anatomic CT images. When <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> is performed, a low-radiation-dose CT without contrast is typically used to keep the radiation dose as low as possible and to limit adverse events. A higher-resolution CT requires a higher dose of radiation and intravenous contrast.</p><p>The superiority of PET to other imaging modalities was illustrated in a meta-analysis of 72 studies including 5042 women with cervical cancer that found the following sensitivities and specificities for the detection of lymph node metastases: PET (sensitivity: 75 percent and specificity: 98 percent), MRI (56 and 93 percent), and CT (58 and 92 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-cancer-staging-and-evaluation-of-lymph-nodes/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Integrated <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> may be more sensitive than PET alone for detection of nodal metastases, particularly for pelvic lymph nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-cancer-staging-and-evaluation-of-lymph-nodes/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>].</p><p>However, there appear to be limitations to imaging with PET, depending upon nodal site and disease stage. PET appears to perform better for the detection of positive paraaortic nodes than pelvic nodes. In a literature review that included 15 studies of women with cervical cancer, pooled estimates were higher for the sensitivity of PET for paraaortic node involvement (sensitivity: 84 percent and specificity: 95 percent) than pelvic nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-cancer-staging-and-evaluation-of-lymph-nodes/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Some data have raised concern that in locally advanced cervical cancer, <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> may have a higher false-negative rate for detecting paraaortic lymph node spread than previously appreciated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-cancer-staging-and-evaluation-of-lymph-nodes/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. As an example, a study in 60 patients with stage IB2 to IVA disease found that 12 percent of those with no finding of positive paraaortic nodes on <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> findings had pathologically positive paraaortic nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-cancer-staging-and-evaluation-of-lymph-nodes/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. A subset of patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> findings of positive pelvic and negative paraaortic nodes had an even higher rate of pathologically positive paraaortic disease (22 percent). In a separate study of <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> and pathologic analysis of paraaortic nodes, patients with PET-positive pelvic nodes were more likely than those with PET-negative pelvic nodes to have paraaortic lymph node metastases confirmed at surgery (24 versus 3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-cancer-staging-and-evaluation-of-lymph-nodes/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10161497\"><span class=\"h3\">Upper urinary tract involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tumor extension to the bladder and ureter may result in hydronephrosis and, ultimately, in nonfunctioning kidney in women with cervical cancer.

The most commonly used are serum squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) antigen, tissue polypeptide antigen, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), CA-125, and CYFRA 21-2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-cancer-staging-and-evaluation-of-lymph-nodes/abstract/57-72\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-72</a>]. Many of these markers are elevated in a significant proportion of patients with more advanced-stage disease, and they correlate with disease activity.

The potential clinical utility of this finding is in the ability to identify preoperatively most women who would likely require trimodality treatment (ie, surgery and chemoradiotherapy) so that they could be considered for primary chemoradiotherapy rather than surgery. The disadvantage is that 43 percent of women identified for primary chemoradiotherapy might have been treated by surgery alone and avoided the long-term morbidity of radiation therapy.
