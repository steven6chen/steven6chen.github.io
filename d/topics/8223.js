When that happens, you take in air, and then your voice box closes shut, which is what causes the &quot;hic&quot; sound.</p><p>Most bouts of hiccups last less than 48 hours. Rarely, they can last longer. Hiccups that last longer than a month are called &quot;intractable hiccups.&quot;</p><p>In most cases, hiccups go away on their own with no lasting effects. But in some people, they can last a long time and lead to problems such as poor nutrition, tiredness, and reduced appetite.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11954451\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes hiccups?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common causes include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having an overly full stomach</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drinking soda or other fizzy drinks</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swallowing air (for example when you are chewing gum)</p><p/><p>In rare situations, hiccups can have more serious causes, such as infections or irritation of a nerve in the neck or diaphragm. Intractable hiccups are unusual but could indicate another medical problem, such as acid reflux or cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11954466\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to get rid of the hiccups?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, there are a few things you can try:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hold your breath for several seconds or longer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathe out against your closed mouth and nose (the way you might do on an airplane to pop your ears)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stimulate the back of your throat, for example, by sipping cold water, gargling with water, or swallowing a teaspoon of sugar</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pull your knees up to your chest and lean forward</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11954489\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse if you have hiccups that last longer than 48 hours. He or she will ask about your symptoms and do an exam. Most cases of hiccups are harmless. But the doctor or nurse might want to do a few tests, depending on your symptoms, medical history, and what the exam shows.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11954504\"><span class=\"h1\">How are hiccups treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the self-help steps listed above do not work, there are a number of prescription medicines that can help. Acupuncture can also help some people. Surgery might be needed to treat some people with extreme symptoms who do not get better with other treatments, but this is rare.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11954519\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acid-reflux-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux disease) in adults (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acid-reflux-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux disease) in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
