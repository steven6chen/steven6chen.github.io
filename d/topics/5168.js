Since most AIDS patients have disseminated disease, the most sensitive and specific test is detection of histoplasma antigen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>When resources are limited, the simplest and least expensive test (although not definitive) is direct microscopy of budding yeast within tissues or body fluids. The combination of culture with direct microscopy increases the diagnostic yield.</p><p>Timely diagnosis requires a high index of clinical suspicion. The advantages and disadvantages of these methods for diagnosis of histoplasmosis in the HIV-infected patient are discussed below.

Antigen detection can be performed on samples of urine, serum, cerebrospinal fluid, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In one report, HPA was detected in AIDS patients with disseminated histoplasmosis in the following samples: urine (97 percent), blood (83 percent), and cerebrospinal fluid (67 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In another report, antigen testing was positive in 39 of 40 HIV-infected patients in urine and 36 of 37 patients in serum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Even though the results of HPA testing may not be immediately available, levels should be sent if histoplasmosis is suspected, since they are useful in monitoring disease activity.

In one retrospective study of 46 HIV-infected patients with disseminated disease, isolator blood cultures were positive in 50 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In a recent study of Colombian patients with HIV and histoplasmosis, cultures were positive in 138 of 184 patients (75 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The diagnostic yield of sputum in the AIDS population has not been well studied.

The reported diagnostic yield of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in AIDS patients has varied, but one small study of 27 patients found the sensitivity of BAL on stain and culture to be 70 percent and 89 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Laboratory personnel involved with Histoplasma cultures should use appropriate procedures to prevent exposure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Direct microscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnosis can be rapidly made by visualization of the organism within cells on a Wright's stained smear of either peripheral blood or a buffy coat.

Bone marrow, bronchial, and lymph node aspirates can also be stained with Wright, Giemsa, or May-Gr&uuml;nwald-Giemsa; this inexpensive method is particularly useful in some endemic resource-limited areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F75209%7EID%2F74406%7EID%2F65482\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75209 graphicRef74406 graphicRef65482 \">picture 1A-C</a>).

In a study of 36 patients with AIDS and suspected disseminated disease, the combination of blood culture plus examination of the peripheral smear by direct microscopy had a sensitivity of 88 percent for diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In AIDS patients with disseminated disease and with negative blood smears, bone marrow aspiration with direct staining is an equally sensitive method for diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The advantage of direct microscopic examination is that a positive result enables rapid initiation of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Tissue preparation leads to a delay in diagnosis and sensitivity is similar to direct microscopy. Sites for sampling include bone marrow, lymph nodes, and skin and mucosal lesions, if present. Laboratory evidence of granulomas with yeasts resembling Histoplasma in extrapulmonary tissues is consistent with disseminated disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F68444\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68444 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Serology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Standard serology, consisting of either complement fixation or immunodiffusion, has a combined diagnostic yield of approximately 70-92 percent in patients with AIDS and histoplasmosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>]. However, since results may be delayed for two to six weeks, serologic tests are of limited value in the initial diagnosis of histoplasmosis. Non-reactive serologic testing has also been described in HIV-infected patients with disseminated disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>].</p><p>Immunodiffusion is less sensitive but more specific than complement fixation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Although no specific titer has been found to indicate disease activity, titers of at least 1:8 by complement fixation are present in 70 percent of patients with active infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/6,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A positive skin test to histoplasmin is not predictive of active disease.

However, skin testing has proven useful in epidemiologic studies aimed at identifying areas of endemicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tuberculosis is the leading pathogen to consider in the differential diagnosis of histoplasmosis.

Therefore, patient management should include a diagnostic evaluation for both infections. Pneumocystis is another leading diagnostic consideration due to the common radiographic appearance of diffuse infiltrates.</p><p>Since HIV-infected patients with histoplasmosis have advanced immunosuppression, they are often concurrently infected with other opportunistic pathogens, supporting the need for a careful search for co-infections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rapid initiation of therapy is indicated due to the high mortality of disseminated disease.
