SUI occurs when an increase in intraabdominal pressure exceeds urethral closure pressure, resulting in the involuntary leakage of urine. This may occur with exertion, sneezing, or coughing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-type-of-midurethral-sling/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Treatment of SUI includes both conservative (eg, vaginal pessaries, pelvic floor muscle exercises) and surgical options. Minimally invasive midurethral synthetic slings have become the procedure of choice for many women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-type-of-midurethral-sling/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The first of these was the tension-free vaginal tape, introduced in 1996 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-type-of-midurethral-sling/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The second major procedure, the transobturator midurethral sling, was introduced in 2001 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-type-of-midurethral-sling/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The transobturator procedures are designed to avoid some of the complications of retropubic insertion (eg, bladder perforation, vascular injury, bowel injury). Since that time, many other devices have been developed, with a variety of introducer mechanisms or mesh types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-type-of-midurethral-sling/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>The process of choosing a type of midurethral sling for women with SUI who have not had a prior anti-incontinence surgery will be reviewed here. Choosing between midurethral slings and other procedures, nonsurgical management of SUI, treatment of recurrent SUI, and diagnosis and treatment of other types of urinary incontinence are discussed separately.

These procedures vary by the location of the sling and by the sling material. Collectively, these slings are referred to as suburethral slings, which is a sling that is inserted through a small vaginal incision and attached to another structure in the pelvis for the purpose of supporting the urethra. Suburethral slings may be either bladder neck or midurethral slings.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Midurethral sling &ndash; A suburethral sling that is placed at the level of the midurethra in a tension-free manner. These slings are made of synthetic mesh.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Retropubic midurethral slings</strong> (eg, tension-free vaginal tape [TVT]) are inserted through the retropubic space and exit through the abdominal wall in the suprapubic area (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F59114\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59114 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Transobturator midurethral slings</strong> (eg, TVT Obturator) are inserted through the two obturator foramens and exit through the skin of the groin area (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F52240\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52240 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Single incision midurethral slings </strong>(eg, MiniArc) (also referred to as mini-slings or mini-tapes) differ from full-length retropubic and transobturator slings in two ways: they are shorter (approximately 8 cm rather than 40 cm) and they require only a vaginal incision, and not an abdominal incision. Different types of these slings may be placed in a retropubic (anchored to the urogenital diaphragm) or transobturator fashion (anchored to the obturator internus muscle). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bladder neck sling &ndash; A suburethral sling that is placed at the level of the proximal urethra and bladder neck (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76965\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76965 \">figure 3</a>). This procedure is usually performed using both vaginal and abdominal incisions. These slings can be made of either biologic materials (including the patient's own tissue) or synthetic mesh.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Bladder neck slings are also referred to as proximal urethral slings. Alternatively, they are referred to as pubovaginal slings when the arms of the sling material are affixed to the anterior rectus fascia rather than the pubic bone or Cooper's ligament [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-type-of-midurethral-sling/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H497779\"><span class=\"h1\">FULL LENGTH SLINGS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2822326\"><span class=\"h2\">Transobturator versus retropubic midurethral slings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When midurethral sling surgery is planned, the surgeon and patient must decide between a transobturator or retropubic sling. Both are widely used, and the efficacies appear to be comparable, although they have differing risk profiles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-type-of-midurethral-sling/abstract/7,9-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9-18</a>]. In our practice, we counsel the patient about the different types of adverse effects associated with each type of sling and make the choice of sling based upon patient preference:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retropubic slings have slightly higher efficacy at the cost of greater rates of bladder perforation, bowel injury, more short-term postoperative suprapubic pain, and postoperative voiding dysfunction, which could require sling release.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transobturator slings have a slightly lower efficacy and more short-term postoperative groin pain. However, they are associated with less voiding dysfunction than retropubic slings.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H68521624\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transobturator and retropubic slings appear to have comparable efficacy. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 55 randomized trials including over 8600 women reported similar one-year subjective and objective cure rates for the two sling types, with cure rates ranging from 62 to 98 percent in the transobturator group, and from 71 to 97 percent in the retropubic group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-type-of-midurethral-sling/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A second systematic review and meta-analysis of 28 randomized trials including over 15,855 patients also found that retropubic slings had higher subjective and objective cure rates than those receiving transobturator slings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-type-of-midurethral-sling/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>One of the trials included in the above meta-analysis, the Trial of Midurethral Slings (TOMUS), also reported five-year follow-up data for 597 women randomly assigned to either sling procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-type-of-midurethral-sling/abstract/9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11</a>]. Additional important findings from the five-year follow-up included [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-type-of-midurethral-sling/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More women reported incontinence over time regardless of sling type. There was a nonsignificant trend toward higher incontinence rates for transobturator versus retropubic sling procedures (56 versus 49 percent). It is not known if this incontinence increase was a result of the surgical procedure, the underlying incontinence process, or natural aging.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient-reported outcomes for quality of life, sexual function, and global assessment of improvement decreased with time in both treatment groups but remained greater than presurgery measurements. Compared with retropubic slings, women with transobturator slings reported more sustained improvement in urinary symptoms, quality of life, and sexual function despite the slightly lower treatment success rate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>New mesh exposures continued to occur throughout the five-year follow-up, but the overall rate of mesh exposure remained low at 1.7 percent. </p><p/><p>Similar to the TOMUS data above, a five-year cohort study of over 8600 Danish women reported that women with the transobturator slings were twice as likely to undergo reoperation as women with retropubic slings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-type-of-midurethral-sling/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A subsequent study of data from the same Danish registry reported absolute five-year reoperation rates of 6 percent for retropubic slings and 9 percent for transobturator slings. Longer-term studies are emerging. A study that followed 46 out of 52 women from Switzerland and Italy with retropubic slings for 17 years reported overall satisfaction and negative stress test rates of 89 and 91 percent, which are similar to the one-year cure rates above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-type-of-midurethral-sling/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, 15 (29 percent) of these women reported <em>de novo</em> overactive bladder and were taking antimuscarinic or beta agonist therapies and 4 percent reported persistent voiding dysfunction that was observed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3196377155\"><span class=\"h3\">Complication comparison</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two sling approaches have been associated with different surgical complications. Overall, the majority of adverse events appear higher using the retropubic approach than the transobturator approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-type-of-midurethral-sling/abstract/15,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,19</a>]. </p><p>Lower rates of urinary tract injury (eg, bladder perforation), voiding dysfunction, major vascular injury, operating time, hospital stay, and blood loss have been reported with transobturator compared with retropubic slings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-type-of-midurethral-sling/abstract/9,12,14,15,19,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12,14,15,19,22</a>]. Additionally, retropubic sling placement may increase risk of bowel injury in women with prior abdominal or pelvic surgery (including abdominal and inguinal hernia repair) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-type-of-midurethral-sling/abstract/23-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-27</a>].

However, whether the transobturator and retropubic approaches have different effects on sexual function is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-type-of-midurethral-sling/abstract/31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-34</a>].

Of the 138 patients assessed at six months with urodynamic studies, more women in the transobturator group had urodynamic stress incontinence compared with the retropubic group (45 percent versus 21 percent).

(See <a href=\"#H2822614\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retropubic full length slings may have slightly higher continence rates compared to transobturator slings but are associated with higher risk of intra- and postoperative complications. Bladder perforation and voiding dysfunction are more likely to occur in women who have undergone a retropubic sling procedure, while short-term groin pain is associated almost exclusively with transobturator slings. In our practice, we counsel the patient about the efficacy and potential adverse effects associated with each type of sling and make the choice of sling based upon patient preference.(See <a href=\"#H2822326\" class=\"local\">'Transobturator versus retropubic midurethral slings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women planning midurethral sling surgery, we suggest a full-length rather than single incision sling (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Patients should be counseled about risks of adverse events for each type of sling. (See <a href=\"#H497737\" class=\"local\">'Single incision versus full-length slings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adjustable midurethral slings are single incision slings which allow postoperative adjustment of sling tension and are a new development. These slings require further evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H2823278\" class=\"local\">'Adjustable slings'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-choosing-a-type-of-midurethral-sling/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Haylen BT, de Ridder D, Freeman RM, et al.
