But it's important for women with diabetes to get their blood sugar levels under control. Women whose blood sugar levels are under control are less likely to have problems during pregnancy. Women with high blood sugar levels are more likely to have problems during pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H328178581\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I should do before trying to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you are thinking about getting pregnant and have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, talk with your doctor or nurse before you start trying. He or she can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Help you get your blood sugar levels under control</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make changes to your medicines, if they need to be changed &ndash; This is especially important since some medicines used to treat diabetes are not safe to take during pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treat any medical problems you have &ndash; Some people with diabetes also have other problems, such as eye problems, obesity, high blood pressure, or kidney disease. Your doctor or nurse can talk to you about how to treat these problems and how they might affect your pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1479066219\"><span class=\"h1\">What problems can be caused by high blood sugar levels?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High blood sugar levels can cause problems throughout pregnancy and after the baby is born:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early on, high blood sugar levels can increase the chance that a woman has a miscarriage. A miscarriage is when a pregnancy ends on its own before the woman has been pregnant for 20 weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High blood sugar levels early on can also increase the chance that a baby will be born with a birth defect, such as a spine or heart problem.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Later on, high blood sugar levels can increase the chance that a baby gets too big (heavier than 9 pounds). That is a problem, because a big baby can get hurt if it cannot easily fit through the birth canal. A big baby can also damage its mother's body during a vaginal delivery. Sometimes, the mother has to have a c-section (surgery to get the baby out).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High blood sugar levels at the end of pregnancy can sometimes cause the baby to have problems right after birth. This can include blood sugar levels that are too low, or other issues.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1479066226\"><span class=\"h1\">What doctors will take care of me during pregnancy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different doctors will take care of you during pregnancy. One doctor will take care of your pregnancy. This doctor might also be able to take care of your diabetes. If not, you will see your diabetes doctor or nurse during pregnancy. He or she will:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tell you what your blood sugar levels should be and how often to check them &ndash; Many women need to check their blood sugar levels every day before and after meals.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Help you make changes to your diet and medicines so that your blood sugar levels stay under control</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1479066233\"><span class=\"h1\">Why might my diabetes medicines need to be changed?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your diabetes medicines might need to be changed because:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women who take insulin might need more insulin during pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some diabetes pills are not safe to take during pregnancy. Women who take these pills need to start using insulin or take a different pill during pregnancy. Your doctor will tell you which medicine is right for you.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women who don&rsquo;t already take medicine for their diabetes might need to start taking a diabetes medicine during pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1479066240\"><span class=\"h1\">How else might pregnancy affect me?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sometimes, pregnancy worsens the eye and kidney problems that people with diabetes can get. Pregnancy can also make high blood pressure worse. Your doctor will check you for these problems by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Doing blood and urine tests to check your kidneys</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Doing eye exams</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Checking your blood pressure at each visit</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1479066247\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I have a normal vaginal delivery?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chances are good that you will have a normal vaginal delivery. But women with diabetes are more likely to have a c-section than women without diabetes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1479066254\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my baby be healthy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your blood sugar levels have been under control, chances are good that your baby will be healthy. But your baby's doctor will keep a close eye on your baby. That's because babies whose mothers have diabetes can have problems, including low blood sugar or breathing problems. Most of these problems go away on their own within 1 to 2 days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4055170606\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my baby have diabetes?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diabetes is very rare in babies. Children whose mothers have diabetes do have a higher chance of getting diabetes later in life, compared with children of mothers without diabetes. But most children whose mothers have diabetes will not get it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1479066268\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=type-1-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Type 1 diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=type-2-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Type 2 diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=using-insulin-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Using insulin (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=c-section-cesarean-delivery-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: C-section (cesarean delivery) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=care-during-pregnancy-for-women-with-type-1-or-2-diabetes-mellitus-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Care during pregnancy for women with type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetes-mellitus-type-1-insulin-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Diabetes mellitus type 1: Insulin treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose-in-diabetes-mellitus-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Self-monitoring of blood glucose in diabetes mellitus (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=c-section-cesarean-delivery-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: C-section (cesarean delivery) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
