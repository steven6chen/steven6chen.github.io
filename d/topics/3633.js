It is characterized by periodic episodes of paroxysmal headache accompanied by nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and relief with sleep.</p><p>This topic will review the classification of migraine in children. Other aspects of migraine are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of migraine in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-treatment-of-migraine-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute treatment of migraine in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORICAL ASPECTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The 1988 classification of headaches by the International Headache Society (IHS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] did not specifically address children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This system replaced the terms &quot;classic and common&quot; with the terms &quot;with and without aura.&quot; Migraine was classified into migraine with aura, migraine without aura, complicated migraine, and migraine variants.</p><p>In a 2004 revision of headache classification, the term &quot;Complicated migraine&quot; was replaced by &quot;Complications of migraine&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The 2004 and 2013 revisions also reclassified some syndromes unique to children that historically were considered manifestations of migraine. These syndromes &ndash; cyclical vomiting, abdominal migraine, benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood, and benign paroxysmal torticollis &ndash; are usually associated with a positive family history and often evolve into more characteristic migraine symptoms with age. They were classified in 2004 as &quot;childhood periodic syndromes that are commonly precursors of migraine&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In 2013, they were reclassified as &quot;Episodic syndromes that may be associated with migraine&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Episodic syndromes that may be associated with migraine'</a> below.)</p><p>Some of the other disorders discussed here, including Alice in Wonderland syndrome and confusional migraine, are not addressed in the International Classification of Headache Disorders system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Other pediatric migraine variants'</a> below.)</p><p>Ophthalmoplegic migraine is now thought to arise from a recurrent demyelinating neuropathy. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent painful ophthalmoplegic neuropathy (Ophthalmoplegic migraine)'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MIGRAINE WITHOUT AURA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Migraine without aura is a recurrent headache disorder characterized by attacks lasting 2 to 72 hours in children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F50876\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50876 \">table 1</a>). Typical features include a headache of moderate to severe intensity with a pulsating quality of pain that is associated with nausea, photophobia, or phonophobia and is aggravated with routine physical activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Photophobia and phonophobia may be detected based on behavior in young children.</p><p>Unilateral headache is not typical of migraine until after puberty. In children, the headache is more often described as bifrontal or across the front or middle of the forehead, bitemporal, or generalized rather than unilateral. Posterior headache is unusual and should prompt a work-up for the possibility of a posterior fossa lesion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children#H483945901\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of migraine in children&quot;, section on 'Migraine headache phase'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H422967719\"><span class=\"h2\">Menstrual migraine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Menstrual migraine (also called menstrually associated migraine or catamenial migraine) is reviewed here briefly and discussed in detail elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estrogen-associated-migraine#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Estrogen-associated migraine&quot;, section on 'Menstrual migraine'</a>). It is defined as migraine headache that occurs in close temporal relationship to the onset of menstruation; this time period usually encompasses two days before through three days after the onset of menstrual bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Menstrual migraine is usually not associated with aura even in women who have migraine with aura at other times. Girls and women with menstrual migraine may also have migraine at other times during the month.</p><p>The pathogenesis of menstrual migraine is thought to be related to the decreasing levels of estrogen and progesterone that occur with menstruation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estrogen-associated-migraine#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Estrogen-associated migraine&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H422967212\"><span class=\"h1\">PREMONITORY SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In migraine with or without aura, children frequently have premonitory symptoms consisting of various combinations of face changes (pallor <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> shadows under the eyes), fatigue, irritability, anxiety, sensitivity to sound or light, yawning, nausea, concentration problems, food cravings, cacosmia, neck stiffness, and hyperactivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. In a survey of 103 children and adolescents with migraine, premonitory symptoms were reported by 67 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The most commonly reported premonitory symptoms were face changes, fatigue, and irritability (44, 42, and 24 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The premonitory symptoms precede the migraine attack by 2 to 48 hours.</p><p>Former terms for premonitory symptoms include &quot;prodrome&quot; and &quot;warning symptoms,&quot; but the use of these terms is now discouraged because they can be confused with migraine aura [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MIGRAINE WITH AURA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Auras represent progressive neurologic deficits or disturbances with subsequent complete recovery. Migraine auras are classified into the following types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Visual</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sensory</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Speech <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> language</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Motor</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brainstem</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retinal</p><p/><p>Approximately 14 to 30 percent of children report an aura preceding a migraine, although the incidence may be underestimated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Visual disturbances are the most common type, accounting for the majority of the neurologic symptoms associated with migraine and bilateral symptoms are less typical in children and adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Numbness and tingling of the lips, lower face, and fingers of one hand (cheiro-oral) is the second most common type of aura. Auras may also involve other senses. Less frequently, migraine aura causes speech, language, motor, brainstem, or retinal deficits. Some patients have several types of aura symptoms that vary with attacks. When the aura involves motor weakness, the disorder is classified as hemiplegic migraine. (See <a href=\"#H698850692\" class=\"local\">'Hemiplegic migraine'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Typical aura</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A migraine with typical aura consists of visual <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sensory <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">speech/language</span> symptoms but no motor weakness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F50876\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50876 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Additional features of a typical aura include gradual development, duration no longer than one hour, and complete reversibility. If the aura includes motor weakness, which can last as long as 72 hours, the migraine may be classified as familial hemiplegic migraine or sporadic hemiplegic migraine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H698850692\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemiplegic migraine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary feature that separates hemiplegic migraine from other types of migraine with aura is the presence of motor weakness as a manifestation of aura in at least some attacks. The clinical aspects of hemiplegic migraine are reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemiplegic-migraine\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemiplegic migraine&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hemiplegic migraine may occur either in families or only in one individual (sporadic). Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) is defined as migraine with aura that includes motor weakness in a patient who has at least one first or second degree relative who also has migraine aura that includes motor weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The first three types of FHM are channelopathies numbered according to the gene involved. FHM1 is caused by mutations in the CACNA1A gene, FHM2 by mutations in the ATP1A2 gene, and FHM3 by mutations in the SCN1A gene. Mutations in the PRRT2 gene also cause some cases of familial hemiplegic migraine. The known types of familial hemiplegic migraine account for only a small proportion of cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemiplegic-migraine#H81876416\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemiplegic migraine&quot;, section on 'Familial hemiplegic migraine'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Migraine with brainstem aura</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Migraine with brainstem aura, formerly known as basilar-type migraine, is reviewed here briefly and discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=migraine-with-brainstem-aura-basilar-type-migraine\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Migraine with brainstem aura (basilar-type migraine)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Migraine with brainstem aura is a rare form of migraine with aura wherein aura symptoms arise from the brainstem but motor weakness is not present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It affects both genders but is more common in females. Onset is usually between ages 7 to 20. Attacks may evolve to more typical forms of migraine with age. The auras consist of some combination of vertigo, dysarthria, tinnitus, diplopia, bilateral visual symptoms, bilateral paresthesias, decreased level of consciousness, or hypacusis.</p><p>Migraine with brainstem aura should be diagnosed only when weakness is absent, since about 60 percent of patients with familial hemiplegic migraine (see <a href=\"#H698850692\" class=\"local\">'Hemiplegic migraine'</a> above) have basilar-type symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Differential diagnosis includes acute ataxia of childhood, toxic ingestion, or posterior fossa structural lesions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1561676361\"><span class=\"h2\">Vestibular migraine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Previously known as migraine associated <span class=\"nowrap\">vertigo/dizziness,</span> migrainous vertigo, and migraine related vestibulopathy, vestibular migraine can start at any age. It is characterized by migrainous headache associated with moderate to severe vestibular symptoms lasting 5 minutes to 72 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Although related, it is a separate entity from benign paroxysmal vertigo seen in childhood as vestibular migraine requires a previous diagnosis of migraine, whereas benign paroxysmal vertigo does not and may not involve headache. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vestibular-migraine\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vestibular migraine&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H422967068\"><span class=\"h2\">Retinal migraine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retinal migraine is a rare disorder. It is characterized by a sudden loss of vision or the perception of bright light (photopsia) or scintillations in one eye only [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The aura spreads gradually and lasts 5 to 60 minutes; the monocular visual aura is usually accompanied by or followed within one hour by headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The headache is typically ipsilateral and periorbital. Visual symptoms may occur without headache. Vision usually recovers in this condition, although permanent visual loss may occur.</p><p>Funduscopic examination in this condition is abnormal. The retina appears pale and retinal vessels may be constricted.</p><p>Although classified as retinal migraine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], some experts contend that &quot;ocular migraine&quot; is a more precise term, since both retinal and ciliary circulations may be involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">EPISODIC SYNDROMES THAT MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH MIGRAINE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Episodic syndromes that may be associated with migraine include cyclic vomiting syndrome, abdominal migraine, benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood, and benign paroxysmal torticollis; they are considered as potential precursors of migraine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], though some evidence suggests that they are not only precursors but also manifestations of migraine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The previously used term for these conditions was &quot;childhood periodic syndromes.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Cyclic vomiting syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cyclic vomiting syndrome (which often occurs with abdominal migraine), reviewed here briefly and described in detail elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclic-vomiting-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cyclic vomiting syndrome&quot;</a>), is an idiopathic disorder characterized by repeated and usually stereotypical episodes of nausea and vomiting that last for hours to days, separated by symptom-free periods of variable length. The pathogenesis of cyclic vomiting syndrome remains unknown, although it may represent a heterogeneous group of disorders. An association between cyclic vomiting syndrome and migraine has been most consistently described, suggesting that there may be a common pathophysiologic process. However, cyclic vomiting syndrome has also been linked to food allergy, mitochondrial, metabolic, and endocrine disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Abdominal migraine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abdominal migraine is characterized by recurrent episodes of abdominal pain in an otherwise healthy child who is normal between attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. The pain is typically midline or poorly localized, dull and moderate to severe in intensity; headache is not a prominent feature during attacks and may be overlooked if the child is not asked about it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Photophobia or phonophobia are not common. Temperature elevation and diarrhea do not occur. Abdominal pain is associated with at least two additional features that may include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and pallor. Protracted vomiting is more consistent with cyclic vomiting. Precipitating factors are often searched for but not commonly identified; concerns often include dietary and psychological stress.</p><p>Abdominal migraine affects 2 to 4 percent of children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/11,12,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,14</a>], and 4 to 15 percent of children with chronic periodic abdominal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The age at presentation is usually between 2 to 10 years.</p><p>Abdominal migraine is a clinical diagnosis; there are no confirmatory diagnostic tests. The history and physical examination show no evidence of gastrointestinal or renal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The diagnosis with the first event is challenging. The many causes of acute abdominal pain need to be considered in the differential diagnosis. Testing is determined by the history and physical examination but the search for a mechanical process such as obstruction, kidney disorder, infection or metabolic condition may be in order. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-acute-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of acute abdominal pain in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic abdominal pain in children and adolescents: Approach to the evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The pathophysiology of abdominal migraine is uncertain, with consideration to central nervous system, endocrine imbalance, or ionic channel disorders. A genetic factor is suggested; 60 percent are said to have a positive family history of migraine. </p><p>Management remains empiric. Excluding serious abdominal conditions and making the correct diagnosis of migraine may provide some reassurance to the family. Good sleep habits, proper hydration, avoidance of foods high in amines or xanthines, and avoidance of stressful situations when possible may be helpful. Although data are limited regarding pharmacologic treatment for abdominal migraine, analgesics such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ibuprofen</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a> may be useful as abortive therapy if given early during an attack. Antiemetics are indicated if there is significant nausea or vomiting. During an attack, medication administered by suppository is preferable. Daily preventive medication is usually reserved for the child with frequent attacks. Nonanalgesic migraine medications such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">propranolol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyproheptadine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cyproheptadine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pizotifen-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pizotifen</a> (the latter not available in the United States) may be effective as prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. There are also case reports of abdominal migraine responsive to triptans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] and to intravenous valproic acid given in the emergency room [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-treatment-of-migraine-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute treatment of migraine in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The long-term prognosis is good for the intermittent abdominal pain. Most children stop having attacks by early adolescence, but rarely attacks may persist into adulthood. However, most children with abdominal migraine evolve to develop migraine headaches. In one study of 54 children with abdominal migraine who were followed for 7 to 10 years, current or previous migraine headache was identified in 70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The prognosis for the clinical course of migraine headache in such children is thought to be similar to migraine that develops without preceding abdominal spells.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Benign paroxysmal vertigo</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood is characterized by brief recurrent attacks of vertigo in otherwise healthy children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The disorder often presents when the child is a toddler, although may be manifest later in childhood. The attacks occur without warning, are maximal at onset, and resolve spontaneously after minutes to hours. Associated symptoms may include nystagmus, ataxia, vomiting, pallor, and fearfulness. Episodes may cluster, with recurrence of attacks several times within a few hours. Headache typically does not occur. Affected patients may suddenly appear frightened or unable to walk and will hold on for support. Children may experience decreased alertness or loss of strength, but no loss of consciousness. The disorder is benign and typically resolves without treatment, usually by five years of age, sometimes longer. Many patients will subsequently develop typical migraine. A family history of migraine is also often noted. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-children#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonepileptic paroxysmal disorders in children&quot;, section on 'Benign paroxysmal vertigo'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H422967443\"><span class=\"h2\">Benign paroxysmal torticollis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Benign paroxysmal torticollis of infancy is characterized by periods of an abnormal, sustained posture of the head and neck in which the head tilts to either side, with or without slight rotation. The events begin and end suddenly, lasting minutes to days. Associated symptoms can include pallor, irritability, malaise, vomiting, and ataxia. The child is alert and responsive during an attack. Episodes usually first occur in the first few months of life and may recur at varying intervals, resolving by the age of five years in most cases. The pathogenesis of benign paroxysmal torticollis has not been determined. It is considered to be a migraine equivalent disorder. Some patients go on to develop migraine headaches or benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood. There is often a family history of migraine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-torticollis-in-children#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired torticollis in children&quot;, section on 'Benign paroxysmal torticollis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H422967520\"><span class=\"h1\">CHRONIC MIGRAINE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic migraine is reviewed here briefly and discussed in greater detail separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-migraine\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic migraine&quot;</a>). Through a process known as migraine transformation, some patients with an episodic migraine pattern transition to a chronic migraine pattern. Chronic migraine is defined by headache that occurs on &ge;15 days per month for more than three months, with features of migraine headache on at least 8 days per month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Many patients with chronic migraine have daily or near-daily headaches of low to moderate severity, associated with less prominent migrainous features.

They are not addressed in the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3<sup>rd</sup> edition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Alice in Wonderland syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alice in Wonderland syndrome is characterized by episodes of visual hallucinations, bizarre perceptual distortions (eg, of body image), or impairments of time sense that may accompany or precede a headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. The child is not frightened and can describe the experience without amnesia. In one series of 48 patients, the most common complaints were visual misperceptions including micropsia (objects appear too small), teleopsia (objects appear further away), macropsia (objects appear too large), and metamorphopsia (objects have distorted shapes, eg, too fat, thin, short, tall, etc) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The perception disorder lasts from several days to months, and children typically recover without sequelae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The syndrome can affect patients of any age, although it is more common in childhood and adolescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/23,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,26</a>]. Some investigators reserve the term &quot;Alice in Wonderland syndrome&quot; to signify a perceptual disorder involving altered body image, and prefer the term &quot;Alice in Wonderland-like syndrome&quot; to signify an extrapersonal perceptual disorder involving vision, time, or levitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, this distinction is not settled in the literature.</p><p>The cause of Alice in Wonderland syndrome is uncertain. Migrainous ischemia and cortical irritability is thought to be the etiology in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], though the relationship with migraine has been questioned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/24,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,27</a>]. Alice in Wonderland syndrome has also been associated with viral encephalitis, epilepsy, Epstein-Barr virus, other infections, and head trauma, among others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].

Confusional episodes tend to recur, but are eventually replaced by typical migraine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>The clinical features of confusional migraine were described in a series of 13 patients who were hospitalized for migraine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Children ranged in age from 6 to 15 years (mean 10.8 years), and males predominated (11 males, 2 females). The duration of confusion was 2 to 24 hours. The history was positive for mild head trauma (4 patients), agitation (8 patients), past headache (7 patients), and migraine on the maternal side of the family (10 patients). Among 11 patients who had a computed tomography scan, 10 were normal and one had an arachnoid cyst that was considered incidental.</p><p>Some overlap exists between confusional migraine and transient global amnesia, Alice-in-Wonderland, and trauma-induced migraine.

The third cranial nerve is most often involved, resulting in ptosis, pupillary dilation, exotropia, and diplopia. Sixth cranial nerve dysfunction (the second most common variant) leads to esotropia with inability to abduct the eye. Fourth cranial nerve involvement with vertical diplopia is rare. The clinical pattern is atypical for migraine, given the long headache duration (up to a week or more) and a long latent period (up to 14 days) before the onset of ophthalmoplegia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Thickening and enhancement the cisternal segment of the affected cranial nerve may be detected by MRI, consistent with a recurrent demyelinating neuropathy rather than migraine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1155332331\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Hemiplegic migraine may occur either in families or only in one individual (sporadic). Migraine with brainstem aura is a rare form of migraine wherein the aura signs and symptoms arise from the brainstem without weakness.
