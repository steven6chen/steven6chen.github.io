Methamphetamine was first synthesized in 1893. Thirty years later, pharmaceutical formulations were introduced as treatments for nasal congestion and asthma. Methamphetamine was widely used by German, Japanese, and American forces during World War II to increase alertness and decrease fatigue.</p><p>Methamphetamine is used clinically for treatment of attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity (ADHD), short-term treatment of obesity, and as an off-label treatment for narcolepsy. Recreational use of methamphetamine and other amphetamine-derived stimulants has reached epidemic proportions in the United States, Southern Asia, the Philippines, and Japan. After cannabis, it is the most widely abused illicit drug worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methamphetamine-acute-intoxication/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Approximately 5 percent of the United States population has used methamphetamine in their lifetime, with an estimated 500,000 people using the drug in a given month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methamphetamine-acute-intoxication/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>].</p><p>Methamphetamine may be synthesized via simple reactions using readily available chemicals and over-the-counter cold medicines, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ephedrine-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ephedrine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pseudoephedrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pseudoephedrine</a>. Although some illicit methamphetamine is diverted pharmaceutical product, the majority of recreational methamphetamine is manufactured specifically for illicit use. The output of thousands of small laboratories in predominantly rural regions of the United States has been supplanted by &quot;superlabs,&quot; commonly outside the United States, whose output is kilogram quantities. Clandestine methamphetamine synthesis carries significant risk of explosion or toxic exposure and is responsible for exposing many children to profoundly toxic products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methamphetamine-acute-intoxication/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>This topic review will discuss the toxicology, diagnosis, and management of acute methamphetamine intoxication. The general management of acute drug overdose and the management of other stimulants, such as cocaine, are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General approach to drug poisoning in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cocaine-acute-intoxication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cocaine: Acute intoxication&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGY AND CELLULAR TOXICOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phenethylamines comprise a class of central nervous system (CNS) stimulants (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81133\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81133 \">figure 1</a>). Various substitutions on the basic phenethylamine structure determine the degree of CNS penetration, likelihood of degradation by monoamine oxidase (MAO), receptor binding affinity, and the range of effects.</p><p>The prototypical phenylethylamine is alpha methyl phenylethylamine, which is contracted to give the common name amphetamine. Amphetamine possesses a methyl group at the alpha position of the carbon chain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81153\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81153 \">figure 2</a>). Methamphetamine has a second methyl group (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81294\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81294 \">figure 3</a>), which increases lipophilicity and CNS activity. Methamphetamine exists in dextro- or levo- stereoisomers; the dextro- isomer exerts greater CNS stimulation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Methamphetamine-neurotransmitter interactions</strong> &ndash; The neurotransmitters <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norepinephrine-noradrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norepinephrine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>, and serotonin are stored within cytoplasmic vesicles of presynaptic adrenergic neurons. These neurotransmitters are released into the synapse with nerve depolarization. Once in the synapse, the neurotransmitters bind to postsynaptic receptors and elicit neurochemical responses. Thereafter, they diffuse away from the postsynaptic receptor and are either quickly degraded or undergo cellular reuptake and re-placement into vesicles. Reuptake is mediated through <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a> triphosphate (ATP)-dependent or ion-dependent (Na+) neurotransmitter transporters, as well as by concentration gradient channels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Methamphetamine lacks direct adrenergic effects, but is instead an indirect neurotransmitter. Methamphetamine is incorporated into cytoplasmic vesicles where it displaces <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norepinephrine-noradrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norepinephrine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a>, and serotonin into the cytosol. As cytosolic concentrations rise, neurotransmitters diffuse out of the neuron and into the synapse where they activate postsynaptic receptors. Methamphetamine also inactivates neurotransmitter reuptake transporter systems.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The result of these two processes is a surge of adrenergic stimulation. The lone modulatory response to such stimulation is degradation by catechol o-methyl transferase (COMT), a slow, saturable degradation pathway.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Stimulated alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors produce hypertension, tachycardia, hyperthermia, and vasospasm. Serotonergic activation contributes to alterations in mood as well as deranged responses to hunger and thirst. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dopamine</a> receptor stimulation affects drug-craving and drug-seeking behavior, as well as psychiatric symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Methamphetamine is readily absorbed following administration via oral, pulmonary, nasal, intramuscular, intravenous, rectal, and vaginal routes. Body stuffing has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methamphetamine-acute-intoxication/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].</p><p>Methamphetamine is lipophilic, readily crosses the blood-brain barrier, and has a large volume of distribution (3 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/kg)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methamphetamine-acute-intoxication/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Onset of action occurs within seconds after smoking or injection; effects may be observed within 5 minutes after intranasal use or within 20 minutes following oral ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methamphetamine-acute-intoxication/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Peak plasma concentrations are achieved approximately 30 minutes following intravenous or intramuscular administration and up to 2 to 3 hours after ingestion. Although methamphetamine has a plasma half-life of 12 to 34 hours, the duration of its effect commonly persists beyond 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methamphetamine-acute-intoxication/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Elimination of methamphetamine occurs via several hepatic and renal pathways, including cytochrome CYP2D6. Polymorphisms of this cytochrome isoform have been implicated in cases of unanticipated toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methamphetamine-acute-intoxication/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Enzymatic degradation of methamphetamine results in active metabolites which may accumulate with repeated, frequent, or binge use. Renal elimination is pH dependent because methamphetamine has an alkaline pKa of 9 to 10.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians should consider the diagnosis of methamphetamine intoxication in any diaphoretic patient with hypertension, tachycardia, severe agitation, and psychosis. Acutely intoxicated patients may become extremely agitated and pose a danger to themselves, other patients, and medical staff.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients are unable to provide any history because of severe agitation. If possible, clinicians should identify the route of exposure to methamphetamine and the frequency of use, which can help distinguish among short-term, binge, and chronic abuse. Ascertaining the potential amounts of methamphetamine ingested, as well as the use of other illicit substances and coingestants (eg, heroin, benzodiazepines), can guide therapeutic interventions.</p><p>Methamphetamine can cause a host of respiratory, cardiac, vascular, otolaryngologic, neurologic, integumentary, psychiatric, infectious, traumatic, and dental maladies. When possible, a thorough review of systems is in order.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H359307175\"><span class=\"h2\">Body stuffers and body packers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In body stuffers (individuals who ingest methamphetamine to avoid arrest) and body packers (individuals who internally conceal large volumes of drug for transport), special attention should be paid to the heart rate and temperature. According to at least two case series, methamphetamine body stuffers who present with a heart rate above 120 beats per minute or a temperature over 38&deg;C are at greater risk of severe outcomes (including: seizures, altered mental status requiring intubation, creatine kinase &gt;50,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">U/L,</span> increased troponin, liver transaminase increase &gt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">U/L,</span> and death). The number of packets ingested, their size, the wrapping used, the time from ingestion, and abdominal complaints (eg, constipation, obstipation, distention, and vomiting) do not correlate as closely with severe morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methamphetamine-acute-intoxication/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Internal concealment of drugs of abuse (body packing)&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Examination findings associated with intoxication and complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with methamphetamine intoxication range from the virtually asymptomatic to those in sympathomimetic crisis with seizures, metabolic acidosis, and imminent cardiovascular collapse. Agitation, tachycardia, and psychosis are among the most frequent findings identified on presentation to the emergency department [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methamphetamine-acute-intoxication/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Life-threatening intoxication is characterized by hypertension, tachycardia, severely agitated delirium, hyperthermia, metabolic acidosis, and seizures. Prognostic factors for mortality include coma, shock, body temperature &gt;39&deg;C, acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, and hyperkalemia (K 5.6 to 8.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methamphetamine-acute-intoxication/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>General appearance</strong> &ndash; Chronic methamphetamine abusers may appear malnourished, agitated, and disheveled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methamphetamine-acute-intoxication/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Hypervigilance and akathisia may be present in mildly intoxicated patients, while patients with severe acute intoxication may exhibit abrupt changes in behavior, becoming extraordinarily violent. Change in sleeping patterns, severe mood swings and unpredictable behavior are common. Excoriations on the skin and &quot;track marks&quot; (linear eschars over a vein) suggest prolonged and intravenous use, respectively. Profound diaphoresis is common in moderate to severe acute intoxication. Look carefully for stigmata of trauma, which is common among methamphetamine abusers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methamphetamine-acute-intoxication/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vital signs</strong> &ndash; The severity of patient agitation sometimes prevents measurement of vital signs. Methamphetamine produces dose-dependent variations of pulse, blood pressure, and temperature. At low doses (10 to 25 mg), elevations in heart rate and blood pressure may be insignificant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methamphetamine-acute-intoxication/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. At the higher doses generally seen in acute intoxication (30 to 40 mg), sympathomimetic stimulation may produce dramatic increases in heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methamphetamine-acute-intoxication/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Elevated temperature is common in moderate to severe intoxication while hypertensive crisis, hyperthermia, and refractory tachydysrhythmias are associated with severe intoxication.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cardiovascular</strong> &ndash; Tachycardia and hypertension are nearly universal among intoxicated patients irrespective of severity. Cardiac ischemia, myocardial infarction, and cardiomyopathy have been identified in acute and chronic users. Retrospective, observational studies of methamphetamine-exposed patients report that a substantial minority show signs of acute coronary syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methamphetamine-acute-intoxication/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Severe methamphetamine intoxication is associated with sudden cardiovascular collapse, particularly in agitated patients who are physically restrained to prevent injury to themselves and others, including law enforcement and clinicians. Severe agitation often presages cardiac arrest, which can occur with frightening rapidity, and has been observed after only a few minutes' struggle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Cardiovascular collapse is postulated to arise from a combination of neurotransmitter depletion, metabolic acidosis, and dehydration. In 2014, the Unites States National Poison Data System reported 2781 cases of single-substance methamphetamine exposure involving consultation with the Poison Control Center System. There were 30 deaths and 146 life-threatening events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methamphetamine-acute-intoxication/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. These figures likely underestimate the number of severe exposures, due to both under-reporting and the uncertain contribution of methamphetamine to clinical effects in an additional 2145 cases with polysubstance exposures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methamphetamine-acute-intoxication/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Valvular dysfunction may be related to the serotonergic effects of methamphetamine, while aortic dissection and rupture are more likely due to its vasospastic and hypertensive effects. Injection drug use increases the risk of infectious sequelae, such as bacterial endocarditis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat (HEENT)</strong> &ndash; Common HEENT examination findings include minimally reactive mydriasis, mucosal injuries from insufflation (snorting), oropharyngeal burns in methamphetamine smokers, and gingival hypertrophy. Those involved in methamphetamine production are at risk for burn and inhalation injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methamphetamine-acute-intoxication/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Extensive tooth decay (&quot;meth mouth&quot;) is common in chronic methamphetamine abuse due to bruxism, decreased saliva production, and poor dental hygiene (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F80482\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80482 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pulmonary</strong> &ndash; Increases in minute ventilation, respiratory rate, and tidal volume are often associated with severe intoxication. Illicit methamphetamine may contain pulmonary irritants that are directly toxic to the lung. Methamphetamine has been implicated in acute pulmonary edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methamphetamine-acute-intoxication/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], pulmonary hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methamphetamine-acute-intoxication/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>], and, if smoked, thermal injury. Other pulmonary complications include pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, pneumonia, acute lung injury, and pulmonary hemorrhage. Similar injuries have been seen after inhalation of heroin and smoked cocaine (crack) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methamphetamine-acute-intoxication/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-complications-of-cocaine-abuse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary complications of cocaine abuse&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gastrointestinal</strong> &ndash; Methamphetamine can induce vomiting and diarrhea due to sympathomimetic stimulatory effects. Severe abdominal pain out of proportion to physical examination findings suggests methamphetamine-associated bowel ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methamphetamine-acute-intoxication/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], particularly in the setting of body packing and stuffing. Rectal exposure to methamphetamine occurs in cases of transport for distribution (ie, body packing) and rectal administration (&quot;booty bumping&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methamphetamine-acute-intoxication/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Internal concealment of drugs of abuse (body packing)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">Gynecologic/obstetric</strong></span> &ndash; Vaginal exposure to methamphetamine arises from body stuffing, body packing, or vaginal administration of the drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methamphetamine-acute-intoxication/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Among pregnant abusers, placental insufficiency, hemorrhage, and abruption are reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methamphetamine-acute-intoxication/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Extremities</strong> &ndash; The extremities are a likely site of injury from burns or trauma, and stigmata of repeated intravenous injection (track marks) may be present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dermatologic</strong> &ndash; Drug preparation may cause thermal or chemical burns, most commonly to the hands and face [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methamphetamine-acute-intoxication/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Injection drug use may produce cellulitis, abscesses, and track marks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F86745\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86745 \">picture 2</a>). Protracted methamphetamine abuse is associated with formication (&quot;crank bugs,&quot; a feeling that ants are crawling on the skin), and many methamphetamine abusers suffer multiple small skin excoriations from unremitting picking (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F86746\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86746 \">picture 3</a>). Jaundice may be due to hepatitis, while poor nutrition and vitamin deficiencies may cause skin changes (cracking, angular cheilitis, aphthous ulcers) or abdominal bleeding and bruising.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neurologic</strong> &ndash; Choreiform movement disorders are a relatively common finding in acute methamphetamine intoxication, and arise from derangements in dopaminergic neurotransmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methamphetamine-acute-intoxication/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Focal neurologic deficits may represent central nervous system ischemia, infarction, or hemorrhage. Seizures are associated with severe intoxication, typically within 24 hours of methamphetamine use. They are usually self-limited and brief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methamphetamine-acute-intoxication/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Psychiatric</strong> &ndash; Acute methamphetamine use can induce agitated delirium and paranoia. Binge or chronic methamphetamine use is strongly associated with a variety of psychiatric symptoms, including paranoia and psychosis, but delusions, homicidal and suicidal ideation, mood disturbance, anxiety, and hallucinations also occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methamphetamine-acute-intoxication/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Suicidality, homicidality, psychosis, and abnormal behavior and movements are commonly seen in binge as well as chronic users. Psychiatric symptoms are often the chief complaint of patients presenting to the emergency or acute care setting. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Establishing the diagnosis of methamphetamine intoxication requires recognition of the sympathomimetic toxidrome, a condition characterized by signs of adrenergic excess, including: hypertension, tachycardia, hyperthermia, diaphoresis, minimally-reactive mydriasis, and agitation. The diagnosis of methamphetamine intoxication in patients with these findings is supported by a positive result on the amphetamine portion of a qualitative urine drug screen (&quot;tox screen&quot;), although a positive drug screen is not sufficient to make the diagnosis without supporting clinical evidence. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory evaluation'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General approach to drug poisoning in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-the-critically-ill-adult-with-an-unknown-overdose\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of the critically ill adult with an unknown overdose&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The differential diagnosis for patients with clinical findings consistent with the sympathomimetic toxidrome is broad and includes toxicologic and non-toxicologic etiologies. Toxicologic conditions mimicking methamphetamine intoxication include intoxication or poisoning with any of the following drugs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61832\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61832 \">table 1</a>): adrenergic substances (eg, cocaine, phencyclidine [PCP], synthetic cathinones and other synthetic phenethylamines), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, serotonin syndrome, and anticholinergic poisoning.

The duration of action for PCP is less than 8 hours and patients more often manifest nystagmus and rapid, involuntary eye movements. Distinguishing methamphetamine from agents such as synthetic cathinones or other phenethylamines in real time may not be possible, as their pharmacokinetics may be unknown and they may produce false positive results on qualitative screens for amphetamines. The clinically distinct features of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> intoxication (tachycardia, unremitting vomiting, and widened pulse pressure) are confirmed by measurement of the serum theophylline concentration. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Aspirin</a> intoxication produces tinnitus and hyperpnea even in resting patients, as well as metabolic acidosis, hyperthermia, and elevated serum aspirin concentrations.</p><p>Monoamine oxidase inhibitor poisoning has a clinical appearance nearly identical to serotonin syndrome, and both share clinical features with methamphetamine toxicity. While the clinical manifestations of serotonin syndrome include agitation, tachycardia, and diaphoresis, they also include lower extremity tremor and clonus, which distinguish the condition from methamphetamine intoxication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methamphetamine-acute-intoxication/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Patients with anticholinergic poisoning have anhidrosis, whereas methamphetamine intoxicated individuals are profusely diaphoretic. Furthermore, patients with the anticholinergic toxidrome typically pick feebly at objects (sometimes imaginary) and have a peculiar mumbling speech; methamphetamine often produces wildly agitated delirium that often requires a combination of physical and chemical restraint.</p><p>Leading nontoxicologic mimics of methamphetamine intoxication include heat stroke, thyrotoxicosis, and pheochromocytoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-nonexertional-hyperthermia-classic-heat-stroke-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe nonexertional hyperthermia (classic heat stroke) in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exertional-heat-illness-in-adolescents-and-adults-epidemiology-thermoregulation-risk-factors-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exertional heat illness in adolescents and adults: Epidemiology, thermoregulation, risk factors, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of hyperthyroidism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pheochromocytoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of pheochromocytoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Diagnosis of heat stroke should have corroborating history, such as a hot environment, prolonged exercise or exertion, or decreased ability to regulate temperature. Associated medication (such as diuretics, antipsychotics, and some cardiovascular medications) or conditions (such as advanced age, intoxication, debility, and autonomic dysfunction) predispose certain patients to heat stroke.

Some patients also require pharmacologic therapy for control of hypertension. Patients who appear hypovolemic may need fluid resuscitation. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Hypertension'</a> below.)</p><p>The intensity of therapy depends upon the severity of illness, but cases of abrupt decompensation among conservatively treated patients highlight the need for immediate, aggressive intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methamphetamine-acute-intoxication/abstract/16,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,42</a>].

Control of violent behavior is of critical importance. We treat severely intoxicated patients immediately with intravenous (IV) benzodiazepines (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> 2.5 to 5 mg IV or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a> 2 to 4 mg IV or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a> 10 to 20 mg IV). The initial dose of midazolam or lorazepam may be given intramuscularly (IM) if required. IV doses can be repeated every 8 to 10 minutes based upon patient response; high cumulative doses may be needed. As different patients may respond differently to particular benzodiazepines or doses, clinicians may need to add a second benzodiazepine quickly if two or more doses of the first drug selected have little effect. In animal models, benzodiazepines blunt the hyperadrenergic effects of methamphetamine, an outcome associated with increased survival.</p><p>Second generation antipsychotic agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ziprasidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ziprasidone</a> 10 mg IM), butyrophenones (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a> 5 to 10 mg given IM or IV), or combinations of these agents can be used as adjunctive therapy when high doses of benzodiazepines (for example, more than 20 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a> in 30 minutes) do not adequately control psychotic symptoms. Although some studies support the use of butyrophenones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methamphetamine-acute-intoxication/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>], these agents may interfere with heat dissipation, lower the seizure threshold, and prolong the QTc interval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methamphetamine-acute-intoxication/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. </p><p>Although intravenous administration of sedatives is strongly preferred in severely intoxicated patients, IM injection may be used if IV access is unavailable. IM injection may provide sufficient sedation to allow definitive care, including placement of intravenous catheters.</p><p>A less aggressive regimen can be used in patients who are mildly or moderately intoxicated. This includes a quiet environment with minimal sedation in mild intoxications plus, in moderate intoxication, a benzodiazepine. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lorazepam</a> 1 to 2 mg or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a> 10 to 20 mg may be adequate to sedate these patients, but doses should be repeated or increased as needed.</p><p>Physical restraints should be avoided if possible. Patients who struggle against physical restraints undergo isometric muscle contractions that can be associated with lactic acidosis, hyperthermia, sudden cardiac collapse, and death. Chemical sedation must always accompany physical restraints, and physical restraints should be removed as rapidly as possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severely intoxicated hyperthermic patients may require paralysis and endotracheal intubation. Additional indications for endotracheal intubation include refractory agitation; skeletal, cervical, or facial muscle rigidity; and worsening, severe metabolic acidosis.

In patients with severe methamphetamine intoxication in whom severe metabolic acidosis (pH &lt;7.1) is known or strongly suspected, some toxicologists give 50 to 150 mEq (one to three 50 mEq [50 mL] vials or prefilled syringes) of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> prior to intubation to help prevent such complications. However, there is no high quality evidence to support this approach. When administered, bicarbonate should be reserved for severe metabolic acidosis, and then only to raise the serum pH above 7.1 while the cause of the acidosis is determined and definitive measures are taken to treat it. The efficacy of bicarbonate therapy in lactic acidosis is unproven in the absence of severe acidemia and may cause potential harm.

However, hypertension attributable solely to methamphetamine intoxication that is not well controlled with adequate sedative therapy is so uncommon that the clinician should reassess the patient and investigate potential alternative causes (eg, aortic dissection, hemorrhagic stroke, thyroid storm). Patients with persistent severe hypertension due to methamphetamine alone may require treatment with intravenous antihypertensive drugs, although generally antihypertensive medications should be avoided in patients with methamphetamine intoxication. Suitable antihypertensive medications for these patients include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroprusside</a>, nitroglycerine, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phentolamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phentolamine</a>. </p><p>We recommend avoiding medications with beta-blocking activity when treating hypertension during the acute phase of methamphetamine intoxication. Poisoning with sympathomimetic agents such as methamphetamine can produce a hyperadrenergic state associated with an increase in both alpha- and beta-adrenergic tone. We believe that the optimal therapy for patients experiencing cardiovascular complications from acute sympathomimetic poisoning begins with reduction in central nervous system (CNS) catecholamine release, rather than peripheral antagonism of released catecholamines, and that benzodiazepines have a proven role in this regard. Benzodiazepine dosing is described in the section discussing sedation above. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Sedation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cocaine-acute-intoxication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cocaine: Acute intoxication&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2611232558\"><span class=\"h2\">Tachycardia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although tachycardia is common among patients intoxicated with methamphetamine, heart rates are usually in a range that is well tolerated in the short-term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methamphetamine-acute-intoxication/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. However, heart rates above 180 beats per minute may be associated with decreased cardiac output, and individuals with underlying coronary artery disease may develop myocardial ischemia at such rates. In these individuals, benzodiazepine therapy often reduces CNS catecholamine release sufficiently to produce an adequate reduction in heart rate. </p><p>Should additional rate control be needed, we suggest treatment with a calcium channel blocking drug (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a>) using standard doses. Beta-blockers should not be used. Even beta-blockers with some degree of alpha-adrenergic blocking activity, or beta blockers used concurrently with alpha-blockers, increase the risk of vasoconstriction from unopposed alpha-adrenergic activity.

One problem is the limited utility of some traditional markers for hypovolemia in this setting. Tachycardia is almost universal and many patients are hypertensive. Thus, both heart rate and blood pressure may prove unhelpful when assessing volume status. In addition, there is potential for harm from aggressive fluid resuscitation in patients who are acutely hypertensive and may have myocardial dysfunction, possibly leading to pulmonary edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methamphetamine-acute-intoxication/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. If a patient with methamphetamine toxicity is thought to be hypovolemic, resuscitation using isotonic saline is appropriate. Patients receiving fluid resuscitation should be monitored for fluid overload.</p><p>If severe lactic acidosis (pH &lt;7.10) or rhabdomyolysis is present, we suggest aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation to maintain a urine output of at least 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sodium bicarbonate</a> may be used to raise the arterial pH above 7.15 in lactic acidosis and to alkalinize the urine. In animal models, urine alkalization protects against the development of acute renal failure in rhabdomyolysis, but well-controlled human data is lacking.

They are often discovered after an in-home fire or explosion. Any child brought from such an environment requires initial decontamination to prevent exposing health care workers to toxic chemicals. These children are particularly vulnerable to child abuse, neglect, serious injury, exposure to toxic chemicals, and malnutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methamphetamine-acute-intoxication/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. The hypersexuality and drug-seeking behaviors of adult methamphetamine users may lead to sexual abuse of such children, or they may be prostituted for money or drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methamphetamine-acute-intoxication/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy and lactation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Methamphetamine demonstrates teratogenic and embryocidal effects in mammals. Prenatal exposure to methamphetamine has been linked to growth restriction, low birth weight, and withdrawal symptoms in the perinatal period. There is an increased risk of perinatal complication, such as placental hemorrhage, in methamphetamine-exposed mothers. Amphetamines, including methamphetamine, are excreted into breast milk.

Particularly after heavy or prolonged use, abrupt discontinuation of methamphetamine can cause a withdrawal syndrome. Symptoms may develop within hours, typically peak within 1 to 2 days, and most often decrease within two weeks. During the acute withdrawal phase (&quot;the crash&quot;), signs and symptoms may include: dysphoria, anhedonia, fatigue, increased sleep, vivid dreams, insomnia, agitation, anxiety, drug craving, and increased appetite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methamphetamine-acute-intoxication/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>] </p><p>A subacute withdrawal phase may persist for up to three weeks with insomnia, hypersomnia, appetite changes, depression, and possibly suicidal thoughts.

Methamphetamine is readily absorbed following administration via oral, pulmonary, nasal, intramuscular, intravenous, rectal, and vaginal routes. The pharmacology and kinetics of methamphetamine are discussed in the text. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacology and cellular toxicology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacokinetics and metabolism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinicians should consider the diagnosis of methamphetamine intoxication in any diaphoretic patient with hypertension, tachycardia, severe agitation, and psychosis. Patients with methamphetamine intoxication range from the virtually asymptomatic to those in sympathomimetic crisis with imminent cardiovascular collapse. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Methamphetamine can cause a host of respiratory, cardiac, vascular, otolaryngologic, neurologic, integumentary, psychiatric, infectious, traumatic, and dental maladies. Agitation, tachycardia, hypertension, and psychosis are among the most frequent findings. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In severe intoxication, prognostic factors for mortality include: coma, shock, body temperature &gt;39&deg;C, acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, and hyperkalemia (serum potassium 5.6 to 8.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. The clinician should anticipate clinical deterioration and cardiac arrest in any wildly agitated patient, particularly those requiring physical restraints to maintain patient safety. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Sudden cardiac arrest'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis includes a number of poisonings and medical conditions with characteristics of the sympathomimetic toxidrome, a condition characterized by signs of adrenergic excess. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reliance upon qualitative toxicologic screens can be disastrous if care is delayed while awaiting test results. While urine drug tests may support the diagnosis of acute methamphetamine intoxication, the results of such a &quot;tox screen&quot; have little clinical utility. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with acute methamphetamine intoxication may, without provocation, abruptly develop severe agitation and manifest extreme violence, placing themselves, their caretakers, and other patients at risk of major injury. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'General approach and warning about agitation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Sedation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A summary table to facilitate emergent management is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73681\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73681 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The intensity of therapy depends upon the severity of illness, but patients can decompensate abruptly, highlighting the need for immediate, aggressive intervention, even in the absence of confirmatory laboratory data. Control of agitation and hyperthermia comprise the core of management. Common management pitfalls are described above. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Pitfalls in management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Control of violent behavior is of critical importance. We suggest severely intoxicated patients be treated immediately with parenteral benzodiazepines (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Reasonable initial doses include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a> 2 to 4 mg IV or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a> 5 to 10 mg IV. These doses can be repeated every 8 to 10 minutes based on patient response; very large doses may be needed. IV administration is strongly preferred; intramuscular (IM) injection may be used initially when IV access is unavailable. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Sedation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atypical antipsychotic agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ziprasidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ziprasidone</a> 10 mg IM), butyrophenones (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=droperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">droperidol</a> 2.5 to 5 mg or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a> 10 mg given IM or IV), or combinations of these agents can be used as adjunctive therapy when high doses of benzodiazepines do not adequately control symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Sedation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe hypertension, particularly if refractory to aggressive treatment with sedatives, may require treatment with vasodilators (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroprusside</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a>) or alpha-adrenergic antagonists (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phentolamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phentolamine</a>). We suggest avoiding the use of beta-adrenergic antagonists (beta-blockers), including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=labetalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">labetalol</a>. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Hypertension'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sinus tachycardia usually does not require specific treatment, and may respond to benzodiazepines given for agitation and hypertension. If specific treatment is needed, we suggest a calcium channel blocker (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a>). We suggest avoiding beta-blockers, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esmolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">esmolol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=labetalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">labetalol</a>. (See <a href=\"#H2611232558\" class=\"local\">'Tachycardia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Control of hyperthermia (T &ge;41.1&deg;C) involves eliminating excessive muscle activity. While benzodiazepines alone offer benefit to moderately ill patients, severely intoxicated hyperthermic patients may require paralysis with nondepolarizing agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rocuronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rocuronium</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vecuronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vecuronium</a>, followed by tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Succinylcholine</a> is <strong>contraindicated</strong> because of the risk of rhabdomyolysis and hyperkalemic arrhythmias. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Hyperthermia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children and infants, inadvertent exposure to methamphetamine is increasing and may be difficult to diagnose. Agitation, tachycardia, and crying are the most common symptoms of exposure in young children, followed by vomiting with or without abdominal pain, hyperthermia, ataxia, mydriasis, seizures, and roving eye movements.
