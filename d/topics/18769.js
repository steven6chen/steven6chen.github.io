Vulvar pain can feel different to different women. Symptoms of vulvar pain can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Burning or stabbing pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Irritation in the vulva &ndash; Some women also have itching.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling like something rough is rubbing the area</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling &ndash; Some women feel like they are sitting on a hard ball or knot.</p><p/><p>Vulvar pain can be in a specific area or all over. Some women have pain all the time. Others have pain only when something touches the vulva. For example, some women feel pain when they wash the area or a sex partner touches it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H74855083\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes vulvar pain?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vulvar pain has many different causes. Some common causes include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An infection of the vagina or vulva</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A reaction to a soap, lotion, or other product that was on the vulva or in the vagina</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hormone changes after a woman has a baby</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A tear in the vulva from having a baby &ndash; A woman can have pain while the tear is healing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Menopause &ndash; This is the time when a woman stops getting her monthly period.</p><p/><p>Some cases of vulvar pain do not have a cause that doctors can find.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H74855098\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you have vulvar pain, see a doctor or nurse so that he or she can figure out the cause. Your doctor or nurse will talk with you and do an exam.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H74855113\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will do tests to look for the cause of your vulvar pain.</p><p>The most common tests include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests on a sample of fluid from the vagina</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood and urine tests &ndash; These can look for infections.</p><p/><p>You might also have a test called a &quot;biopsy.&quot; In this test, a doctor takes a small sample of skin from the vulva. Another doctor looks at the sample under a microscope. You might have this test if other tests do not show the cause of your vulvar pain, but most women with vulvar pain do not need it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H74855128\"><span class=\"h1\">How is vulvar pain treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on the cause. If the pain is from another medical condition such as an infection, treating the condition usually gets rid of the pain.</p><p>Other treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using medicines to relieve pain &ndash; These can be a cream you put on your skin or a pill you take by mouth.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Talking to a counselor &ndash; Sex or relationship problems can cause vulvar pain. Or having vulvar pain can cause sex problems later on. Counseling can help with these problems.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changing your diet &ndash; Some foods and drinks irritate the bladder and cause vulvar pain. Your doctor might tell you to avoid:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Certain foods, such as tomatoes, alcohol, oranges, and grapefruit</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Chocolate</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Coffee, tea, or sodas with caffeine</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sugar-free foods or drinks</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Putting a cold pack on the vulva &ndash; Such as a frozen gel pack or bag of frozen food wrapped in a soft cloth.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taking a &quot;sitz bath&quot; &ndash; Soaking for 5 to 10 minutes in 2 or 3 inches of warm water is called a &quot;sitz bath.&quot; Do not add soap, bubble bath, or anything else to the water.</p><p/><p>If your vulvar pain is caused by certain types of infections, your sex partner will also need to see a doctor for treatment.</p><p>If sex hurts, stop having it until you get treatment. Having painful sex can create sex and relationship problems in the future.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H74855143\"><span class=\"h1\">Can vulvar pain be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can prevent vulvar pain from some causes by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using warm water and unscented non-soap cleanser to wash your vulva</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taking baths in plain warm water, and not using scented bath products</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wearing cotton underwear, and not wearing underwear or pants that are too tight</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not using sprays or powders on your vagina</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not douching (douching is when a woman puts a liquid inside her vagina to rinse it out)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not wiping with baby wipes or scented toilet paper after you use the toilet</p><p/><p>If you have vulvar pain, your doctor might tell you to avoid certain activities, such as bike riding or horseback riding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H74855158\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrophic-vaginitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Atrophic vaginitis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bladder-pain-syndrome-interstitial-cystitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bladder pain syndrome (interstitial cystitis) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dyspareunia-painful-sex-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dyspareunia (painful sex) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvovaginal-yeast-infection-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vulvovaginal yeast infection (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Diagnosis of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-problems-in-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Sexual problems in women (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-dryness-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vaginal dryness (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-yeast-infection-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vaginal yeast infection (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
