Alpha thalassemia is even more common, occurring with high frequency throughout all tropical and subtropical regions, including most of Southeast Asia, the Mediterranean area, the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East, and Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/public-health-issues-in-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Some variants of thalassemia (eg, hydrops fetalis with hemoglobin Bart's) are incompatible with life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/public-health-issues-in-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], while others (eg, beta thalassemia major) are associated with lifelong transfusion-dependent anemia, short stature, facial abnormalities, delayed or absent puberty, and attendant stigmas and psychosocial problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/public-health-issues-in-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>Of major public health importance, individuals with one of the various forms of thalassemia trait may be entirely asymptomatic, unaware of their diagnosis, and procreate with other individuals with the same trait, thereby perpetuating the disorder within these communities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-thalassemias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the thalassemias&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An interesting anecdote illustrates our changing perceptions about these disorders. Thalassemia was not diagnosed in Cyprus before 1944 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/public-health-issues-in-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. After World War II, following improvements in public health along with malarial eradication programs, it became apparent that there was a newly recognized but common hypochromic microcytic anemia in children not due to iron deficiency (ie, severe beta thalassemia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/public-health-issues-in-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It was quickly realized that, for example, the cost of red blood cell transfusions and chelation therapy per year for a patient with beta thalassemia major exceeded by three to four orders of magnitude the per capita funds available for health care in that country, as well as in much of the developing world.</p><p>By 1970, it was projected that, if this disease was not controlled, by the year 2000 the cost of treatment of these children would consume the entire health care budget of Cyprus and require all of the blood that the island could supply, even supposing that 40 percent of the adults would enlist as regular blood donors.</p><p>In the past, in many of the underdeveloped nations, at a time when the infant mortality rate was above <span class=\"nowrap\">50/1000</span> births, affected countries devoted their public health efforts to controlling neonatal infectious diseases and malnutrition. Thus, of the well over 300,000 infants with major forms of severe hemoglobin disorders, including the thalassemias, who were born every year, many died untreated or even undiagnosed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/public-health-issues-in-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, when the infant mortality rate fell below <span class=\"nowrap\">40/1000,</span> genetic diseases such as the thalassemias &quot;emerged,&quot; along with a demand for appropriate medical services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/public-health-issues-in-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], as occurred in Cyprus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SEVERE THALASSEMIA IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before 1980, hemoglobin E (HbE) was not recognized in California [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/public-health-issues-in-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Now that the California population is 10 percent Asian, the number of children born with thalassemia has been increasing. As a result, the number of births in California of children with homozygous HbE disease now exceeds the number of births of children with sickle cell disease. In addition, there are now 11 new cases of <span class=\"nowrap\">HbE/beta</span> thalassemia per year, as well as 30 new cases per year of HbH disease (severe alpha thalassemia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/public-health-issues-in-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Other examples include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the United Kingdom (UK), there are now more than 50 patients with severe <span class=\"nowrap\">HbE/beta</span> thalassemia, mostly of Bengali or Southeast Asian origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/public-health-issues-in-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 1998 lead article in the journal &quot;Blood&quot; dealt with an emerging health care problem due to an increased frequency of stillbirths secondary to severe alpha thalassemia (ie, hydrops fetalis with hemoglobin Bart's) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/public-health-issues-in-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The article came not from China, Singapore, or Hong Kong, where this syndrome had been well described, but from Ontario, Canada [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/public-health-issues-in-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Towards that end, interactions between &quot;source&quot; areas (ie, those with a high prevalence of alpha thalassemia and substantial emigration) and &quot;sink&quot; areas (ie, those with substantial immigration from source areas) have developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/public-health-issues-in-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

In addition, the hemoglobin Bart's hydrops fetalis syndrome, which is almost universally fatal for the fetus or newborn, is often accompanied by a variety of maternal complications, which may be fatal. Accordingly, programs for prevention of these disorders, and early detection during pregnancy, assume major importance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/public-health-issues-in-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/2,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,14</a>].</p><p>For individual patients with beta thalassemia major, appropriate treatment includes all of the following (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prognosis-of-the-thalassemias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prognosis of the thalassemias&quot;</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/public-health-issues-in-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/1,4,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,15,16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lifelong red cell transfusions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Control of the blood supply to avoid transfusing hepatitis and HIV</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chelation programs to minimize transfusional iron overload</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prompt treatment of all infections</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of endocrine complications related to iron overload, including hormone supplementation to allow normal puberty and growth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Splenectomy when and if hypersplenism occurs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Control of osteoporosis</p><p/><p>Hematopoietic cell transplantation may be appropriate for selected individuals (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Hematopoietic cell transplantation'</a> below).

In response to this need, the HCT program in Pesaro, Italy has completed over 1000 such transplants.

However, this is not a solution for most of the developing world. Unrelated donor HCT has also been used in severely affected adult patients, but only if the potential candidates are rigidly screened and fully informed about the risks of this procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/public-health-issues-in-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

For the beta thalassemias, most are problems in gene transcription, while for the alpha thalassemias, gene deletions are the usual cause. Using reliable probes, it is now possible to screen populations for these defects. Despite the vast heterogeneity of these disorders, it has turned out in practice that in each given geographic and ethnic area there is a reproducible pattern of recurrent abnormalities, such that diagnostic accuracy can be achieved using relatively small numbers of probes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/public-health-issues-in-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/1,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,19</a>].

As examples, the frequency of the hemoglobin Constant Spring (HbCS) gene in Bangkok is 8 percent, the frequency of the HbE trait in the Southeast Asian triangle is 40 to 60 percent, while the frequency of the alpha thalassemia trait in Melanesia and parts of Nepal have reached 70 and 90 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/public-health-issues-in-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21397857\"><span class=\"h3\">Genetic counseling of couples</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To be clinically useful, this screening information has to be coupled with an education program informing local physicians and the affected population about the disease, its manifestations, cause, and clinical course. Following this, there must be accessible opportunities for genetic counseling. As an example, if both parents have beta thalassemia trait, they can be told the following about the chances of an affected child:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Child with severe disease (beta thalassemia major) &ndash; One chance in four</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymptomatic carrier (beta thalassemia trait) &ndash; One chance in two</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unaffected child &ndash; One chance in four</p><p/><p>Genetic counseling has generally had little or no impact on the choice of spouse, although separating and finding another spouse was a major option in Iran before prenatal testing was generally available and abortion of an affected fetus was permitted by the government [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/public-health-issues-in-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. On the other hand, once pregnancy has occurred, given that community educational programs have been effective, the couple will almost invariably seek prenatal diagnosis, which can be achieved before 13 weeks, using chorionic villus biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/public-health-issues-in-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Over an 11-year period from 1993 through 2003, 4587 out of 49,221 screened pregnant women were found to be carriers of alpha or beta thalassemia. Ninety-eight percent of the partners of these women agreed to screening, and 281 of the couples were found to be at risk for severe thalassemia. Prenatal diagnosis was performed in 269 (95.7 percent) of the 281 at-risk pregnancies, which identified 69 severely affected fetuses (25.6 percent). All pregnancies with severely affected fetuses were voluntarily terminated.</p><p>During this time there were only two affected children born at this large regional hospital, both with homozygous alpha (0) thalassemia.

This is coupled with easy access to a program of prenatal diagnosis and screening, along with a very extensive social support program (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F79598\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79598 \">table 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/public-health-issues-in-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Considering the ongoing financial crisis in Greece, it is not clear which, if any, of these benefits persist.</p><p>Parent groups have been encouraged to the extent that 90 percent of thalassemic patients use the support system and are aware of the issues surrounding this disorder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F78796\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78796 \">table 3</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/public-health-issues-in-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

It would be difficult to envision a more extensive and comprehensive program. As a direct result of this effort, the average age of beta thalassemia major patients in Greece is now 27, and very few new patients with beta thalassemia major are being born (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F65994\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65994 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/public-health-issues-in-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Italy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A very similar program, although not quite so extensive, is provided in Italy by the Pediatric Program in Ferrara, which cares for 170 patients with beta thalassemia major [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/public-health-issues-in-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The key to the Ferrara Program is outpatient care and a strong parent association. However, no psychiatric or social support is provided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/public-health-issues-in-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>A study compared the 170 Ferrara patients with 300 patients in the Athens thalassemia program. Surprisingly, the psychosocial adjustment in Ferrara, when formally assessed, was better than that in Athens, where there was considerable hostility and only 30 percent of patients were compliant with chelation therapy. It has been stated that &quot;Illness dominates all aspects of life&quot; in Athens, but not in Ferrara [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/public-health-issues-in-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/5,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,35</a>]. In Ferrara, adjustment was good, even leading to marriage and families, with the social support being provided mainly by the family and its religion. One wonders whether the maximal program in Greece has led to unrealistic expectations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Cyprus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before 1976, the birth rate for severe thalassemia in northern Cyprus was 18 to 20 cases per year.

To ease this burden, the Chinese government has embarked on a comprehensive prevention program featuring population screening, prenatal diagnosis, and genetic research funding, with a goal to do as well as the program initiated in Cyprus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/public-health-issues-in-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>The cost-benefit ratio of an alpha thalassemia prevention program has been conducted in Hong Kong, and has concluded that universal prenatal screening for the alpha and beta thalassemias with the use of DNA testing is cost-effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/public-health-issues-in-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6031919\"><span class=\"h3\">Other countries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cost-benefit analyses of beta thalassemia programs in Quebec, Iran, Israel, and the United Kingdom have generally confirmed the overall benefits of such programs, in that the costs of prevention were lower than the costs of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/public-health-issues-in-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/2,39-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,39-43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPONENTS OF A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is certainly a need to educate physicians about this disease and its management, as well as to have an explicit local, regional, and national policy to cover antenatal and prenatal screening for these hemoglobinopathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/public-health-issues-in-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. It is, however, critical to inform and empower the affected ethnic groups now living in the developed world.

Contact also needs to be made with community leaders to educate, inform, and involve them in community educational programs. Weekly meetings among patients, parents, community leaders, and the medical staff to discuss issues and problems are of paramount importance. Other effective programs would include special family nights, health fairs, and language-specific literature, including information concerning subjects such as genetic counseling, prenatal diagnosis, management of intercurrent illness, sexual development, pregnancy, and osteopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/public-health-issues-in-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/6,30,31,45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,30,31,45,46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21397601\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problem overview &ndash; Beta thalassemia occurs in the Mediterranean littoral and all over Southeast Asia (Burma, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, China, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines). Alpha thalassemia is even more common, occurring with high frequency in Southeast Asia, Africa, and India. A number of issues concerning thalassemia have important public health implications in these countries as well as in the developed world. These include the following (see <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Severe thalassemia in the developed world'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>By 1970, it was projected that, if thalassemia was not controlled in Cyprus, by the year 2000 the cost of treatment of these children would consume the entire health care budget of Cyprus and require all of the blood that the island could supply.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>There are 3500 patients with severe beta thalassemia major in Greece, who consume one-quarter of the country's total blood supply. Iron chelation therapy alone costs 7 million dollars per year.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Before 1980, hemoglobin E (HbE) was not recognized in California. Now that the California population is 10 percent Asian, the number of children born with thalassemia has been increasing. As a result, the number of births in California of children with homozygous HbE disease now exceeds the number of births of children with sickle cell disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In the individual Mediterranean countries, such as Greece and Italy, there is a commonality of language, culture, and religion, and there are strong state-supported health care systems.
