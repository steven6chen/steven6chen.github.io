The specific chemotherapy-related gastrointestinal complications that are reviewed here include diarrhea, constipation, and intestinal perforation. Evaluation and management of patients with acute chemotherapy-related diarrhea is discussed separately, as is diarrhea related to immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors, chemotherapy-induced oral toxicity (mucositis), and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.

Diarrhea is the dose-limiting and major toxicity of regimens containing a fluoropyrimidine with irinotecan. However, in addition to conventional cytotoxic drugs, several molecularly targeted agents (including tyrosine kinase inhibitors [TKIs] and monoclonal antibodies directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR]) are also associated with CRD. (See <a href=\"#H1730603\" class=\"local\">'Specific drugs'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H612325409\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis/mechanisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CRD generally occurs through three major mechanisms: increased secretion of electrolytes caused by luminal secretagogues or reduced absorptive capacity (due to surgery or epithelial damage), called secretory diarrhea; increased intraluminal osmotic substances leading to osmotic diarrhea; or altered gastrointestinal (GI) motility. Direct ischemic mucosal damage is reported in patients treated with agents targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), while an immune-mediated colitis is thought responsible for diarrhea with immune checkpoint inhibitors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2840571685\"><span class=\"h3\">Secretory diarrhea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both FU and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irinotecan-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">irinotecan</a> cause acute damage to the intestinal mucosa, leading to loss of epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterotoxicity-of-chemotherapeutic-agents/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. FU induces mitotic arrest of crypt cells, leading to an increase in the ratio of immature secretory crypt cells to mature villous enterocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterotoxicity-of-chemotherapeutic-agents/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. The increased volume of fluid that leaves the small bowel exceeds the absorptive capacity of the colon, leading to clinically significant diarrhea. Irinotecan produces mucosal changes associated with apoptosis, such as epithelial vacuolization and goblet cell hyperplasia, suggestive of mucin hypersecretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterotoxicity-of-chemotherapeutic-agents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These changes appear related to the accumulation of the active metabolite of irinotecan, SN-38, in the intestinal mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterotoxicity-of-chemotherapeutic-agents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>Up to 50 percent of patients treated with TKIs experience diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterotoxicity-of-chemotherapeutic-agents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. It is thought that the diarrhea occurs through multiple mechanisms. Increased chloride secretion caused by dysregulation of the EGFR signaling pathway, [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterotoxicity-of-chemotherapeutic-agents/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>] colonic crypt damage, gut dysmotility, and alteration in gut microbiota have been proposed. Monoclonal antibodies that release cancer-induced suppression of the immune system, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipilimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipilimumab</a>, a human antibody to cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), cause autoimmune colitis. Diffuse, segmental, or patchy colitis is seen on colonoscopy. Histologically, nonspecific acute and chronic inflammatory infiltrate, cryptitis, and crypt abscesses are noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterotoxicity-of-chemotherapeutic-agents/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Colonic perforation (less than 1 percent) and death in 5 percent of patients have been reported. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rituximab</a>, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody used to treat B-cell lymphoma, can cause new-onset ulcerative colitis or exacerbation of preexisting colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterotoxicity-of-chemotherapeutic-agents/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H919139084\"><span class=\"h3\">Osmotic diarrhea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Damage to the brush border enzyme system within the epithelium can cause diarrhea. Carbohydrates and proteins need to be digested before they are absorbed through the villi, and fats require emulsification. Approximately 10 percent of patients being treated with FU have decreased expression of the enzyme lactase in their intestinal brush border, leading to lactose intolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterotoxicity-of-chemotherapeutic-agents/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. The D-xylose absorption test has been reported to be abnormal in several patients undergoing chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterotoxicity-of-chemotherapeutic-agents/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>], suggesting the presence of carbohydrate malabsorption (such as sucrose, fructose, or even complex polysaccharides). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1443489044\"><span class=\"h3\">Altered intestinal motility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early-onset diarrhea with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irinotecan-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">irinotecan</a> occurs during or within several hours of drug infusion in 45 to 50 percent of patients and is cholinergically mediated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterotoxicity-of-chemotherapeutic-agents/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In contrast, late irinotecan-associated diarrhea is not cholinergically mediated and, instead, appears to be multifactorial, with contributions from dysmotility and secretory factors, as well as a direct toxic effect on the intestinal mucosa. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Irinotecan'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3646987719\"><span class=\"h3\">Antiangiogenesis therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antiangiogenesis therapy is associated with GI tract perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterotoxicity-of-chemotherapeutic-agents/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. The mechanism by which this happens has not been proven, but proposed mechanisms include intestinal wall disruption (ulceration) in areas of tumor necrosis, disturbed platelet-endothelial cell homeostasis causing submucosal inflammation and subsequent ulcer formation, impaired healing of pathologic, chemotherapy-induced or surgical bowel injury, and mesenteric ischemia from thrombosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vasoconstriction; all of these may result in diarrhea as well. Randomized trials of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a> added to chemotherapy for colorectal cancer have resulted in small increases in severe diarrhea, but this has not been observed in other tumor types, suggesting that bevacizumab may not be causing diarrhea directly but, instead, by one of the indirect mechanisms mentioned above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterotoxicity-of-chemotherapeutic-agents/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].

All three drugs are approved for immunotherapy of advanced melanoma. Nivolumab is also approved for advanced non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and Hodgkin lymphoma. Pembrolizumab is also approved for non-small cell lung cancer and head and neck squamous cell cancer.

At the same time, this may result in decreased tolerance to self-antigens. A wide range of immune-mediated adverse events have been observed in patients treated with both drugs, including enterocolitis, which can be serious or life-threatening. It is critical to recognize that treatment of diarrhea caused by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipilimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipilimumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nivolumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nivolumab</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pembrolizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pembrolizumab</a> may require systemic corticosteroids.

Excessive gas <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intestinal cramping commonly accompanies CRD. As the CRD progresses, it can become severe, with frequent watery stools. CRD can be debilitating and, in some cases, life-threatening. Findings in such patients include volume depletion, acute kidney injury, and electrolyte disorders, such as hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis, and depending upon water intake, hyponatremia (increased water intake that cannot be excreted because of the hypovolemic stimulus to release of antidiuretic hormone) or hypernatremia (insufficient water intake to replace losses). Infection, including life-threatening sepsis, can result due to a breach of the intestinal mucosa, which is worsened in the setting of chemotherapy-induced immunosuppression. </p><p>Given the risk for dehydration and infection, severe CRD frequently requires hospital admission for adequate supportive care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterotoxicity-of-chemotherapeutic-agents/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>]. Other sequelae of CRD include increased cost of care, reduced quality of life, treatment delays, and diminished compliance with treatment regimens, which may compromise long-term outcomes if the chemotherapy is being administered with curative intent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterotoxicity-of-chemotherapeutic-agents/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>The severity of CRD is often described using the <a href=\"https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm&amp;token=L1PKi7ksomh1JqUfTKWNe61gdDEj7/EN0gFsM2jnisnZ9aDYBZ/nKF0Y6hAnywy9MOvaze9hPSMvHYdMdeBk6asiYcR9Y9yHOUcUYVkBUtI=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2824\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE)</a> grades; the latest version is outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F65649\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65649 \">table 1</a>).

Nausea, vomiting, rectal bleeding, volume depletion, skin changes, neurologic abnormalities (cerebellar ataxia, cognitive dysfunction, altered level of consciousness), and cardiotoxicity may also occur.

Subsequently, an additional variant in linkage disequilibrium with HapB3 (the intronic polymorphism c.1129-5923C&gt;G) was suggested to activate a splice donor site within intron 10 of the <em>DPYD</em> gene and promote alternative splicing to alter the function of the gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterotoxicity-of-chemotherapeutic-agents/abstract/66-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-68</a>]. However, the effects of this variant are modest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterotoxicity-of-chemotherapeutic-agents/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>], which probably explains the disparate reports on its influence on FU toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterotoxicity-of-chemotherapeutic-agents/abstract/65-68,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">65-68,70</a>].

Inheritance of one of these high-risk alleles does not account for the majority of FU-associated severe toxicity, which is estimated to occur in 15 to 30 percent of treated patients (ie, sensitivity is limited). Finally, even if preemptive pharmacogenomics testing is done and these high-risk alleles are not detected, patients can still have life-threatening toxicity (ie, the specificity is limited).

Furthermore, fewer than half of those who had the <em>DPYD</em>*2A allele developed grade 3 or 4 toxicity (positive predictive value 46 percent).

Given the low frequency of finding a predictive allele and the low sensitivity (ie, patients who lack one of these high-risk <em>DPYD</em> variants may still suffer grade 3 or 4 fluoropyrimidine-related toxicity), preemptive genetic testing of all patients due to receive a fluoropyrimidine in order to identify those with DPD deficiency is controversial and not widely practiced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterotoxicity-of-chemotherapeutic-agents/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].

Although genotyping may identify a small fraction of patients for whom serious toxicity is a concern because of inherited variants in <em>DPYD</em> or <em>TYMS</em>, approximately one-half of patients who develop serious toxicity to fluoropyrimidines do not have an identifiable mutation or polymorphism in either gene (ie, sensitivity is limited). Furthermore, the frequency of these alleles in the general population is quite small, and not all patients who inherit these genetic mutations or polymorphisms suffer from life-threatening toxicity (ie, the positive predictive value is variable). For these reasons, at many institutions, genotyping is reserved for those patients who have unexpected toxicity (myelosuppression, mucositis, diarrhea, neurotoxicity, cardiotoxicity) during the first few cycles of fluoropyrimidine therapy. </p><p>Diagnosis of DPD deficiency can be made by radioimmunometric assay for the DPD enzyme [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterotoxicity-of-chemotherapeutic-agents/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>] or, more commonly, by sequencing of the <em>DPYD</em> gene from a sample of peripheral blood. Current guidelines for <em>DPYD</em> testing from CPIC include only specific variants in <em>DPYD</em> (<em>DPYD</em>*2A, *13, and *9B), which are thought to be the most important but probably account for only some of the variants that are associated with a decreased ability to metabolize these drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterotoxicity-of-chemotherapeutic-agents/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p>Neither test provides rapid results (average turnaround time is 13.3 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterotoxicity-of-chemotherapeutic-agents/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>]. A simple uracil breath test (2-13C uracil breath test [UraBT]) has been developed to detect abnormalities in the entire DPD catabolic pathway, and rapid plasma tests for the ratio of uracil to 5,6-dihydrouracil:uracil (U:UH2) or serum uracil concentration surrogates for DPD activity have also been developed to discriminate individuals who manifest severe toxicity from FU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterotoxicity-of-chemotherapeutic-agents/abstract/50,108-111\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,108-111</a>], but neither is commercially available.

However, this is a controversial area, and this preemptive pharmacogenetic testing has not been widely adopted. Although there are some uncontrolled data suggesting lower toxicity when FU doses are empirically adjusted based upon U:UH2 (a surrogate for DPD enzyme activity) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterotoxicity-of-chemotherapeutic-agents/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>] or a combined approach that included genotyping for <em>DPYD</em> SNPs and U:UH2 ratios [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterotoxicity-of-chemotherapeutic-agents/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>], there are no prospective randomized trials that demonstrate improved toxicity without compromise of efficacy in patients who are preemptively screened versus not screened using any assay for DPD activity, including pharmacogenetic testing for high-risk <em>DPYD</em> and <em>TYMS</em> variants. Furthermore, while suggested recommendations for managing fluoropyrimidine drugs based upon inheritance of polymorphisms <em>DPYD</em>*2A, *13, and *9B are available from CPIC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F91548\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91548 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterotoxicity-of-chemotherapeutic-agents/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>], there are no accepted guidelines for management of patients who are identified as having a high or moderate risk for toxicity according to TYMS variants (ie, should they receive a lower initial dose, enhanced surveillance, pharmacokinetic monitoring, an alternate agent, or a more informed discussion regarding risk?). Any patient who experiences severe toxicity following FU treatment will require a significant dose reduction if treatment will continue. Patients who have unusually severe toxicity or severe toxicity within days after dosing with a fluoropyrimidine should be suspected of having an at-risk <em>DPYD</em> or <em>TYMS</em> mutation. Testing for at-risk mutations in <em>DPYD</em> and <em>TYMS</em> is reasonable in these patients, as dosing recommendations for <em>DYPD</em> mutation carriers are available from CPIC, and because identification of at-risk mutations may be of use if family members are to be treated in the future with fluoropyrimidines. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H204886729\"><span class=\"h4\">Management of DPD-deficient patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a <em>DPYD</em> variant is identified prior to treatment, guidelines for management are available from CPIC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F91548\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91548 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterotoxicity-of-chemotherapeutic-agents/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].

The dose-limiting toxicities are diarrhea, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, and neutropenia. Like FU, capecitabine is catabolized by DPD, and there is a risk for early and severe toxicity in those who are DPD deficient. However, the specific genetic markers of capecitabine-related toxicity are less well studied than with other fluoropyrimidines, such as FU. One analysis concluded that a panel of genetic biomarkers for toxicity from capecitabine monotherapy would include only two <em>DPYD</em> and two <em>TYMS</em> variants; when only these polymorphisms were assessed, the sensitivity for identifying those with severe toxicity was only 26 percent, and the positive predictive value was only 49 percent; the negative predictive value was 70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enterotoxicity-of-chemotherapeutic-agents/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>].

In addition, patients receiving agents targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) may develop direct ischemic mucosal damage, and patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors may develop an immune-mediated colitis. (See <a href=\"#H612325409\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis/mechanisms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, specific colitis syndromes that may arise in patients receiving chemotherapy include neutropenic enterocolitis, ischemic colitis, and <em>clostridium difficile</em>-associated colitis. (See <a href=\"#H3275962162\" class=\"local\">'Colitis syndrome that may arise in patients treated with chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Finally, patients who develop diarrhea during chemotherapy may also suffer from organic causes of diarrhea, such as bacterial overgrowth, fat or bile acid malabsorption, intake of excess quantities of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorbitol</a> or lactose intolerance, and inflammatory and infectious causes, which should not be overlooked. (See <a href=\"#H3578457409\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CRD typically begins with an increasing frequency of bowel movements <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a loosening of the stool consistency. Excessive gas <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intestinal cramping commonly accompanies CRD. As CRD progresses, it can become severe, with frequent watery stools. The severity of CRD is often described using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) grades; the latest version is outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F65649\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65649 \">table 1</a>).

Management of CRD according to the severity of the diarrhea and the presence or absence of other risk factors is outlined in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F64251\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef64251 \">algorithm 1</a>) and presented in detail elsewhere.

Both the therapeutic efficacy and the frequency of diarrhea associated with FU are increased when given concurrently with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a> (LV). The highest frequency of diarrhea occurs with bolus rather than continuous 24-hour infusion of <span class=\"nowrap\">FU/LV</span> for up to five days, particularly with weekly administration, but it occurs with all schedules. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Fluorouracil'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) is the rate-limiting enzyme in fluoropyrimidine catabolism. Enzyme activity varies widely, with most of the variability arising from genetic polymorphisms in the DPD gene (<em>DPYD</em>). Patients who are partially or totally deficient in DPD activity cannot adequately degrade fluoropyrimidines, leading to an increased risk of severe, sometimes fatal, toxicity, including diarrhea, myelosuppression, and mucositis. In addition to <em>DPYD</em>, high-risk polymorphisms in the thymidylate synthetase gene (<em>TYMS</em>) may be associated with an increased risk of severe toxicity from fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109665\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109665 \">table 2</a>), although the data are less certain than with <em>DPYD</em>. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Predictive markers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Testing is commercially available that might identify patients who are at risk for severe toxicity from fluoropyrimidines based upon <em>DPYD</em> and <em>TYMS</em> genotype. Some authors suggest that testing should ideally be carried out before initiation of treatment to identify high-risk patients; however, this is a controversial area, and this approach has not been widely adopted. Although genotyping may identify a small fraction of patients for whom serious toxicity is a concern, most patients who develop serious toxicity to fluoropyrimidines do not have mutations in either <em>DPYD</em> or <em>TYMS</em> (ie, sensitivity is limited). Furthermore, the frequency of high-risk alleles in the general population is quite small (mostly &lt;1 percent), and many patients who inherit these polymorphisms will not suffer from undue toxicity (ie, the positive predictive value has been variable). For these reasons, we generally reserve genotyping for those patients who have unexpected toxicity (myelosuppression, mucositis, diarrhea, neurotoxicity, cardiotoxicity) during the first few cycles of fluoropyrimidine therapy. (See <a href=\"#H44530323\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacogenetic testing for DPYD and TYMS variants'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Late diarrhea from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irinotecan-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">irinotecan</a> is unpredictable, noncumulative, and occurs at all dose levels. In early clinical trials of irinotecan, late diarrhea and neutropenia were the main dose-limiting toxicities. Diarrhea has been less common in later studies because of the stricter adherence to management guidelines (including routine early institution of high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loperamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loperamide</a>) and the use of infusional rather than bolus FU in combination with irinotecan.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The active form of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irinotecan-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">irinotecan</a>, SN-38, is further metabolized by the polymorphic enzyme uridine diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1). Approximately 10 percent of North American patients are homozygous for the <em>UGT1A1</em>*28 allele (which is the cause of Gilbert syndrome). In some studies, homozygotes (and to a lesser degree, heterozygotes) have had significantly higher rates of both diarrhea and myelosuppression with irinotecan.
