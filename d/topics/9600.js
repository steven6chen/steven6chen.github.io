Target blood sugar levels depend on a child's age and the time of day (for example, if it is before or after a meal or bedtime).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28524157\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I know what my child's blood sugar level is?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can check your child's blood sugar level using a device called a &quot;blood glucose meter.&quot; There are different types of blood glucose meters, but most of them work the same way. You will need to prick your child's fingertip to get a drop of blood (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F57918\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57918 \">picture 1</a>). You will put the drop of blood onto a test strip that goes into the meter. After a few seconds, the meter will show your child's blood sugar level.</p><p>Every few months, your child's doctor will also do a blood test. This test, called an &quot;A1C,&quot; shows what your child's average blood sugar level has been over the past 2 to 3 months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28524172\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I keep my child's blood sugar under control?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To help control your child&rsquo;s blood sugar, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Learn about diabetes and the things that can raise or lower your child's blood sugar. Ask your child's doctor or nurse if you have any questions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spread out the carbs your child eats over the whole day. Carbs are sugars and starches that are in the food we eat. They can raise a person's blood sugar level. If you spread out your child's carbs over the whole day, you can help keep his or her blood sugar level from getting too low or high.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Learn how to balance your child's insulin dose with what he or she eats and how much he or she exercises.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Check your child's blood sugar often. If you check your child's blood sugar often, you can treat low or high blood sugar before it becomes an emergency. Checking your child's blood sugar often will also help you learn how food and exercise affect your child's blood sugar.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep a record of your child's blood sugars. Show the record to your child's doctor or nurse so that he or she can change the treatment plan as needed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Work with your child's school to plan how to manage your child's diabetes during school hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Talk to your teenager. Although most teens can check their own blood sugar and give themselves insulin, they can sometimes get into trouble with their diabetes. For example, they might drink alcohol or skip meals, both of which can lower blood sugar. To help prevent a driving accident, teens should test their blood sugar anytime they plan to drive.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Teach the important adults in your child's life about diabetes and how to take care of your child's diabetes. These adults can include babysitters, grandparents, and coaches.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28524187\"><span class=\"h1\">What if my child's blood sugar level is low or high?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your child's doctor or nurse will tell you how to treat low or high blood sugar. The treatment depends on the blood sugar level, your child's age, symptoms, and the time of day.</p><p>Low blood sugar might be treated with either:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A quick source of sugar &ndash; Your child can eat or drink a quick source of sugar (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F56918\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56918 \">table 1</a>). Foods that have fat, such as chocolate or cheese, do not raise low blood sugar levels as quickly. You should carry a quick source of sugar for your child at all times.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A glucagon shot &ndash; Glucagon is a hormone that can quickly raise blood sugar levels. It comes in the form of a shot. If your child's doctor recommends that you carry a glucagon shot for your child, he or she will tell you when and how to use it (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F64557\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64557 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F50427\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50427 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F61722\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61722 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p/><p>High blood sugar is usually treated with insulin and extra fluids. If your child has an episode of high blood sugar, you might need to test his or her blood or urine. Your child's doctor or nurse will show you how to do this.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28524202\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=type-1-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Type 1 diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=my-child-has-diabetes-how-will-we-manage-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: My child has diabetes: How will we manage?
