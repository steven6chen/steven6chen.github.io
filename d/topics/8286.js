However, the terminology to refer to this phenomenon has undergone substantial evolution since its initial characterization. </p><p>This topic uses a widely employed classification scheme that groups such neurocognitive deficits under the umbrella term, HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). The range of deficits included in this scheme is defined by performance on standardized neuropsychological testing. In general terms, HIV-associated dementia refers to severe neurocognitive deficits that lead to substantial functional impairment. Milder deficits are termed mild neurocognitive disorder (MND) if they lead to minor symptoms or impairment and asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ANI) if they do not. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-associated-neurocognitive-disorders-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Terminology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1231871347\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the main treatment modality for HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). The available data support a preventive and therapeutic value of ART for the more severe manifestations of HAND (ie, HIV-associated dementia [HAD]). However, other aspects of ART for HAND are less well-defined, specifically, the impact of ART on milder forms of cognitive impairment and the optimal regimen for HAND.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2691828120\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy of ART for HAND</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1555528583\"><span class=\"h3\">ART for HAD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ART has a clear beneficial effect on the treatment and, more particularly, prevention of HAD. Early in the history of antiretroviral use, a randomized controlled trial demonstrated that treatment of HIV infection resulted in improved cognitive function in patients with HAD. In that trial, those who were randomly assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a> monotherapy had better subsequent performance on neuropsychological testing compared with baseline and compared with patients who received placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-neurocognitive-disorders-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Other observational studies and case series have noted substantial improvement, albeit with some residual impairment, in neurocognitive performance with ART initiation in patients with HAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-neurocognitive-disorders-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Finally, the widespread use of ART has had a profound effect on the incidence of HAD, which is now very low in patients on suppressive ART. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-associated-neurocognitive-disorders-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H49824933\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Prevalence in the ART era'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1555528589\"><span class=\"h3\">ART for milder forms of HAND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The impact of ART on the milder forms of HAND (ie, minor neurocognitive disorder [MND] and asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment [ANI]) is not as clear as for HAD. There are no systematic data demonstrating an improvement in milder neurocognitive deficits with ART initiation, and some studies report a substantial prevalence of mild, persistent cognitive dysfunction despite use of suppressive ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-neurocognitive-disorders-management/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-associated-neurocognitive-disorders-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H49824933\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Prevalence in the ART era'</a>.) </p><p>Furthermore, while pathological evidence suggests that the development of HAD is associated with HIV infection of the central nervous system (CNS), an association between CNS infection and brain dysfunction is less established for milder forms of HAND. Even though there are no clear alternative explanations for mild cognitive dysfunction if confounding conditions have been eliminated, this ambiguity regarding the role of HIV CNS infection in mild impairments lends further uncertainty about the potential effect of ART and of particular drug regimens in this setting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2691827718\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy of specific regimens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whether certain contemporary ART regimens are more effective than others for HAD is uncertain and has not been extensively studied. Estimations of the potential efficacy of various ART regimens for HAD have been based on the knowledge of the pathogenesis of HAD and pharmacokinetic data regarding CNS drug exposure (based largely on CSF drug kinetics). These pharmacokinetic data have been translated into a simplified CNS penetration effectiveness (CPE) rank. It has been proposed that antiretroviral agents that penetrate the CNS better (and accordingly have a higher CPE rank) can more effectively treat the HIV CNS infection that underlies HAD and thus are more effective for HAD. Most of the data supporting this hypothesis come from observational cohort studies. Randomized, controlled studies have generally focused on patients with mild or no baseline neurocognitive deficits (rather than patients with HAD), and they do not clearly demonstrate that ART regimens chosen for such CNS penetration properties result in better neurocognitive outcomes than others. We feel that CPE rank can be helpful as a simple guide to CNS drug exposure, but this information should be used within a broader context of drug properties when selecting individual patient treatments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F89401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89401 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>Details on the CPE rank and the data of ART regimens chosen to optimize CPE rank are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1555528872\"><span class=\"h3\">CPE rank</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antiretroviral medications differ in their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier to penetrate the central nervous system (CNS). The CNS penetration-effectiveness (CPE) rank was devised to simplify the incorporation of this pharmacokinetic information, along with limited information on actual antiviral efficacy for CNS HIV infection, into clinical practice and for research purposes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F89401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89401 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-neurocognitive-disorders-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In the most recent version of the CPE ranking, a score of 1 indicates very poor penetration into the CSF and a score of 4 indicates the best penetration, with inhibitory concentrations achieved in CSF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-neurocognitive-disorders-management/abstract/7-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-14</a>]. However, the ranking does not take into account other important properties of the drugs that also influence regimen choice, such as virologic potency, systemic pharmacokinetics, systemic toxicities, and genetic barrier to resistance. Many of the drugs listed in the CPE rank are no longer used in resource-rich settings or are not among those recommended for first-line use for initial therapy. As an example, of the antiretroviral agents recommended for HIV treatment because of potency and tolerability, only <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dolutegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dolutegravir</a> has a CPE rank of 4. </p><p>Additionally, the CPE rank is based primarily on the drug concentration in the CNS, but the effectiveness of an antiretroviral agent in a particular compartment can be affected by aspects other than the concentration in that compartment. As an example, the concentrations of tenofovir in the blood do not fully explain its systemic efficacy, perhaps because of the greater importance of intracellular drug levels for that agent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1555528878\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy of CPE-based ART</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical benefit of selecting ART based on CPE scores in treating or preventing neurocognitive decline has been difficult to establish, with mixed results from observational studies and inconclusive data from randomized trials.</p><p>In one trial, 49 HIV-infected patients with mild neurocognitive impairment who were initiating ART or changing their regimen for any reason were randomly assigned to an ART regimen optimized for CPE score versus a non-optimized regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-neurocognitive-disorders-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Most patients had a modest improvement in neurocognitive performance at 16 weeks, but there was no significant difference in improvement between the two groups. In addition, fewer patients in the CPE-optimized group achieved virologic suppression at 16 weeks (54 versus 82 percent in the non-optimized group), although this difference was not statistically significant. Overall, a number of issues limit the interpretation of these results. These include low accrual rates, early termination of the study, a proportionally high drop-out rate (59 patients were originally randomized), short follow-up time, and an apparent breakdown of randomization, with a higher proportion of patients in the CPE-optimized group having baseline risk factors for neurocognitive dysfunction. Despite these caveats, the study demonstrated no benefit to using a CPE-based strategy for ART selection, suggesting that CPE rank alone is an inadequate guide to drug selection in patients with milder neurocognitive impairment. </p><p>In another trial assessing the preventive value of regimens with a higher CPE score, 250 treatment-na&iuml;ve HIV-infected patients in China with CD4 cell counts &lt;350 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> and normal performance on neurocognitive testing at baseline were randomly assigned to zidovudine-lamivudine-nevirapine (a CPE score of 10) or tenofovir-lamivudine-efavirenz (a CPE score of 6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-neurocognitive-disorders-management/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. After 96 weeks, 114 and 119 patients in the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nevirapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nevirapine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=efavirenz-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">efavirenz</a> groups, respectively, underwent repeat neurocognitive testing. Patients in the efavirenz group had a slightly greater decrease in neurocognitive function over time compared with the nevirapine group. Whether this difference in neurocognitive performance is clinically significant is unclear. Moreover, only 69 of the patients in the nevirapine group actually remained on the initial ART regimen; the remainder switched regimens, mainly because of adverse effects. This high rate of regimen change not only leads to uncertainty about the validity of the results but also underscores the drawbacks of prioritizing the CPE score over other regimen characteristics, such as tolerability.</p><p>Many [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-neurocognitive-disorders-management/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>], but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-neurocognitive-disorders-management/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>], observational studies have suggested that ART regimens that have higher CPE scores are associated with better scores on neuropsychological testing. In one study of 185 HIV-infected patients, initiation of an ART regimen with a high CPE score was associated with greater improvements in tests of concentration, speed of mental processing, and mental flexibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-neurocognitive-disorders-management/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, a much larger observational study suggested the opposite. In that retrospective study, which included over 60,000 HIV-infected individuals, initiation of a high versus a low CPE-ranked regimen was associated with the development of HIV-associated dementia (hazard ratio 1.74, 95% CI 1.15-2.65) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-neurocognitive-disorders-management/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. This study also illustrates the limitations in assessing an ART regimen based on CPE rank alone, as some regimens with very low CPE scores had less than three drugs included and other high CPE-scored regimens had many agents, potentially prescribed in the setting of drug resistance, and these issues may have impacted outcomes more than CPE score. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3369451992\"><span class=\"h2\">Antiretroviral agents to avoid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=efavirenz-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">efavirenz</a> has relatively good CNS penetration, it can be associated with several adverse neuropsychiatric side effects. These may confound early evaluation of neurocognitive deficits. Furthermore, its low barrier to resistance could be problematic in the setting of poor adherence. Thus, we generally do not use it in the setting of neurocognitive disorders. </p><p>Additionally, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=efavirenz-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">efavirenz</a> is generally avoided in patients with psychiatric conditions. This is not only because of the well confirmed association with CNS toxicity, especially early in treatment, but also because of emerging evidence of increased suicidality with efavirenz use. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1555528595\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENTS NOT ON ART</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is recommended for all untreated HIV-infected patients to reduce the risk of disease progression (including the risk of HIV-associated dementia [HAD]) and the risk of non-AIDS defining complications. ART is the main treatment for HAD, and the diagnosis of HAD is one of several conditions that increase the urgency to initiate ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-neurocognitive-disorders-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-to-initiate-antiretroviral-therapy-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;When to initiate antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1555529008\"><span class=\"h2\">Regimen selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recommendations on ART selection for patients with HAND are largely based on expert opinion rather than empirical evidence and are controversial because of the overall paucity of high quality data comparing particular drug regimens. In our practice, consideration of CNS drug penetration in regimen selection depends on the level of neurocognitive deficits. (See <a href=\"#H3369452117\" class=\"local\">'Patients with HAD'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3369452128\" class=\"local\">'Patients with milder deficits'</a> below.)</p><p>Certain antiretroviral regimens are recommended for initial treatment of HIV because of extensive data documenting their virologic potency and safety profiles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F70143\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70143 \">table 2</a>). For all HIV-infected patients, primary considerations in selecting one of these recommended regimens include the level of plasma HIV RNA, the baseline plasma virus genotype, potential for drug interactions, and the presence of certain co-morbidities (eg, renal insufficiency). This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selecting-antiretroviral-regimens-for-the-treatment-naive-hiv-infected-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selecting antiretroviral regimens for the treatment-na&iuml;ve HIV-infected patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For patients with neurocognitive impairment, a controversial issue is whether central nervous system antiretroviral drug exposure should be a secondary consideration when selecting initial ART. As discussed elsewhere, antiretroviral agents differ in their ability to cross the blood brain barriers, but clinical data do not demonstrate a clear benefit to selecting an ART regimen based on this feature. In the United States, this is becoming less of an issue as most recommended regimens have favorable CPE scores. (See <a href=\"#H2691827718\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of specific regimens'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3369452117\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with HAD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the beneficial effects of HIV control in patients with HAD, we initiate ART promptly in such patients. We use one of the following regimens, as long as there are no documented or expected resistance to these regimens or other contraindications:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tenofovir-emtricitabine plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dolutegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dolutegravir</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-and-lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Abacavir-lamivudine</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dolutegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dolutegravir</a> (if HLA-B*5701 is negative)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tenofovir-emtricitabine plus ritonavir-boosted <a href=\"topic.htm?path=darunavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">darunavir</a></p><p/><p>The first two regimens are among the recommended regimens for initial treatment of HIV infection in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-neurocognitive-disorders-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], and all have theoretical benefit related to their CNS pharmacokinetics. As with regimen selection for HIV infection in general, the choice between them depends on factors such as resistance testing results on the plasma virus, expected toxicity, pill burden, drug-drug interaction potential, comorbid conditions, and cost. Another consideration in regimen choice for patients with HAD is ease of dosing, as cognitive impairments may affect treatment adherence with more complicated regimens. Of the above options, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-and-lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir-lamivudine</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dolutegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dolutegravir</a> is the most convenient, as it is a single, once-daily pill. For patients whose baseline resistance profile precludes use of one of these regimens, we select a regimen based primarily on the resistance profile of the virus and the virologic potency, and expected tolerability of the regimen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selecting-antiretroviral-regimens-for-the-treatment-naive-hiv-infected-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selecting antiretroviral regimens for the treatment-na&iuml;ve HIV-infected patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Expected penetration of the regimen into the CNS is a secondary consideration. Despite the lack of direct clinical evidence supporting a benefit to selecting regimens based on CNS penetration, the potential benefits of using an ART regimen that has good CNS penetration are most compelling for patients with HAD. The major neuropathological correlate of HAD is CNS HIV infection, with local replication of HIV with CNS macrophages and related cells. Thus, the rationale for effective antiretroviral drug concentrations in the CNS is most relevant in patients with HAD. Although differences in the resistance profiles between the plasma and CSF virus in untreated patients presenting with HAD have been reported, regimen selection based on the resistance of the plasma virus is usually sufficient in these cases. We do not routinely evaluate for CNS HIV levels or resistance profiles of the CSF virus in patients with HAD who are initiating ART.</p><p>The regimens listed above optimize virologic potency, tolerability, and CNS penetration. Both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dolutegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dolutegravir</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=darunavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">darunavir</a> have excellent CNS penetration. Of other agents that are included in first-line regimens, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raltegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">raltegravir</a> can achieve therapeutic CSF levels in some patients, but overall, levels are lower. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=elvitegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Elvitegravir</a> also likely has CSF pharmacokinetics that are inferior to those of dolutegravir.</p><p>There are minimal data clarifying the relative efficacy of the nucleoside backbones (ie, tenofovir-emtricitabine or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-and-lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir-lamivudine</a>) in treating HAD. It is unclear whether the superior CSF pharmacokinetics of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a> over tenofovir outweigh those of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emtricitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">emtricitabine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a>. Additionally, while <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tenofovir disoproxil fumarate</a> does not achieve therapeutic levels in CSF and thus has a low CPE rank, this may underestimate its intracellular efficacy and thus not provide an adequate measure of its treatment value. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3369452128\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with milder deficits</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with mild deficits, we typically do not consider CNS penetration when selecting an antiretroviral regimen. However, if competing comorbidities or patient characteristics do not constrain regimen selection, it is reasonable to choose among preferred ART regimens based on expected efficacy for CNS HIV infection, as for patients with HAD. (See <a href=\"#H3369452117\" class=\"local\">'Patients with HAD'</a> above.)</p><p>The arguments for using an ART regimen that has good CNS penetration are more tenuous for these patients given the uncertain role that active CNS HIV infection plays in the pathogenesis of milder deficits and the absence of data suggesting that particular regimens are more effective than others.

Patients with HAD typically respond favorably to initiation of ART, although the overall degree of improvement can vary from dramatic restoration of neurocognitive functioning to amelioration but persistence of motor deficits and cognitive disability. The time course of improvement is also variable but is usually appreciated within one to three weeks and continues for several months. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3369452163\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENTS WITH VIRAL SUPPRESSION ON ART</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevailing management issue for patients who are on suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) but present with neurocognitive impairment is whether there is any neurocognitive benefit to modifying their ART regimen. Recommendations on this issue are largely based on expert opinion rather than empirical evidence and are controversial because of the overall paucity of high quality data. Our approach to this issue depends on the severity of the presenting symptoms: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with severe neurocognitive signs and symptoms that are new or progressive, ensuring that other potential causes of neurocognitive decline have been excluded is the first step in management. This usually begins with careful neurological history, examination, and neuroimaging. For those in whom HIV infection appears to be the only potential cause of the impairments, we evaluate the CSF for the presence of detectable HIV. If present, this suggests symptomatic viral escape syndrome, and we tailor ART to target the HIV populations in the CSF. If CSF HIV levels are undetectable, there is no clear evidence that altering ART regimens is of benefit, and we do not switch regimens in these cases.

Other conditions, such as cerebrovascular disease, neurodegenerative diseases (particularly as patients get older), or substance use, may also lead to neurological dysfunction and impairment. If not already performed, an exhaustive evaluation for other potential causes, including neuroimaging and lumbar puncture, should be done to rule out these other conditions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-associated-neurocognitive-disorders-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H77004430\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Severe deficits, on ART'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=early-onset-dementia-in-adults#H1655988560\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Early-onset dementia in adults&quot;, section on 'Additional testing'</a>.)</p><p>Symptomatic CSF escape (detectable CSF virus despite viral suppression in the plasma), although uncommon, is a consideration with new or progressive severe symptoms in virally suppressed patients.

For patients who have suppressed or near undetectable plasma viral levels, this entails lumbar puncture and analysis of CSF for HIV RNA levels. Further management depends on the presence of detectable CSF HIV RNA. (See <a href=\"#H1555529451\" class=\"local\">'Patients with detectable CSF HIV'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1555529537\" class=\"local\">'Patients with undetectable CSF HIV'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1555529554\" class=\"local\">'When CSF HIV testing is not available'</a> below.) </p><p>Unfortunately, HIV testing of the CSF is not universally available, but in patients who may have symptomatic CSF escape, the information is particularly useful in guiding when and how to modify treatment. In general, we feel that ART should not be changed in order to improve neurological effects without clear documentation and characterization of detectable CSF HIV RNA. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1555529451\"><span class=\"h4\">Patients with detectable CSF HIV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A detectable CSF HIV level in the setting of plasma viral suppression and new or worsening neurocognitive symptoms is consistent with symptomatic CNS escape. An uncommon syndrome, it is essentially a form of isolated treatment failure in the CNS in which local HIV infection within the CNS compartment is not effectively suppressed by systemically suppressive ART. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-associated-neurocognitive-disorders-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H2423796465\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'CNS viral escape syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>For patients with this symptomatic CNS viral escape syndrome, we perform genotypic resistance testing on the CSF HIV, if available. In such cases, we generally recommend a switch to an ART regimen tailored to the drug resistance profile of the CSF virus. While optimizing the typical considerations for regimen selection (eg, virologic potency and tolerability), we try to ensure that two or more agents that have expected efficacy against the CSF virus are included. Additionally, we also try to optimize the likely CNS drug penetration of the chosen agents and assure that these active drugs have the capacity to reach the CNS site of infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F89401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89401 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>If a genotype of the CSF virus is not available, regimen modification is generally done empirically, taking into consideration the CNS drug penetration along with the patient's treatment history. </p><p>After regimen change, it is useful to repeat the lumbar puncture after six weeks or so to determine if the CSF pleocytosis has resolved along with the CSF HIV RNA elevation.</p><p>Support for this strategy comes from retrospective studies describing patients presenting with symptomatic CNS viral escape, in whom drug resistance to the ART regimen in use was frequently detected in the CSF viral population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-neurocognitive-disorders-management/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Following modifications in the ART regimen to optimize activity against the CSF viral genotype and CNS drug penetration, most patients experienced improvement in symptoms and reduction in CSF HIV level. While a direct causative effect cannot be proven, the clinical improvement, resolution of CSF pleocytosis, and CSF viral suppression following the directed changes in ART suggest that there was a local, compartmentalized infection in the CSF that was not effectively treated despite plasma viral suppression. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1555529537\"><span class=\"h4\">Patients with undetectable CSF HIV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the absence of detectable CSF HIV, there is no evidence that changes in ART regimen will be beneficial, and we suggest not switching regimens. In the absence of other causes of neurological decline or detectable HIV in the CSF, onset or progression of severe neurological deterioration is unusual. Furthermore, regimen switching poses risks, including possible adverse effects or nonadherence that may lead to virological failure, which could outweigh any theoretical neurocognitive benefit.</p><p>Some expert groups, including an international expert group on HAND (the Mind Exchange Working Group), suggest switching the ART regimen even if the CSF HIV RNA level is undetectable and using the CPE rank to guide selection in patients who have progressive cognitive defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-neurocognitive-disorders-management/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The rationale for this is the possibility of persistent very low level virus in the CSF that cannot be detected by standard testing. However, there is no direct evidence to support this strategy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1555529554\"><span class=\"h4\">When CSF HIV testing is not available</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the clinical laboratory will not perform HIV viral load or genotypic testing on CSF, CSF can be frozen and sent to a research or commercial laboratory that does perform those assays. If this is not feasible, the presence of CSF pleocytosis without other identifiable cause can be a surrogate marker to support the diagnosis of the CSF escape syndrome and justify a change in therapy, although it is preferable to more directly document the condition and the presence of drug resistance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1231871584\"><span class=\"h2\">Mild or residual symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who have achieved virologic suppression on ART, we generally do not switch ART regimens because of persistent or mild neurocognitive deficits. </p><p>Although improvements in cognitive functioning in HAD following the initiation of ART can be marked, residual deficits often persist, and there are no data that regimen modification leads to further improvements. Additionally, patients can develop mild neurocognitive deficits while on suppressive ART. No studies have clearly demonstrated that switching to a regimen with a greater CNS penetration will delay or prevent clinically significant mild cognitive deficits, and randomized trials evaluating this strategy did not show clear benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-neurocognitive-disorders-management/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>] (see <a href=\"#H2691827718\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of specific regimens'</a> above). Regimen switching poses risks, including possible adverse effects or nonadherence that may lead to virological failure, which could outweigh any theoretical neurocognitive benefit. Similarly, treatment intensification (ie, adding an additional antiretroviral agent to the regimen) likely has no effect in this setting, though this strategy has only been evaluated in small trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-neurocognitive-disorders-management/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. </p><p>Some experts will check the CSF HIV viral level in this setting and, if detectable, the genotype of the CSF virus and switch ART regimens to one tailored to the CSF virus genotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-associated-neurocognitive-disorders-management/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, in patients with mild neurologic impairment and plasma viral suppression, the CSF viral load is characteristically low, generally too low for resistance testing.

Even asymptomatic deficits, however, may be a predictor of further cognitive decline.

When these occur without an evident cause other than HIV infection, such impairments have been collectively classified as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Depending on the severity and impact on daily functioning, cognitive deficits can be classified into three conditions: asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ANI), HIV-associated mild neurocognitive disorder (MND), and HIV-associated dementia (HAD). (See <a href=\"#H1231867481\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-associated-neurocognitive-disorders-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Terminology'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the main treatment modality for HAND. ART has a clear beneficial effect on the treatment and prevention of HAD. The impact of ART on the milder forms of HAND (ie, MND and ANI) is not as clear. (See <a href=\"#H2691828120\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of ART for HAND'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It has been proposed that antiretroviral agents that penetrate the central nervous system (CNS) better, as reflected by the CNS penetration-effectiveness (CPE) rank (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F89401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89401 \">table 1</a>), can more effectively treat the HIV CNS infection that underlies HAD and thus are more effective. However, trials do not clearly demonstrate that ART regimens chosen for CNS penetration properties result in better neurocognitive outcomes. We feel that CPE rank can be helpful as a simple guide to CNS drug exposure, but this information should be used within the broader context of drug properties (eg, virologic potency, tolerability) when selecting regimens for individual patients. (See <a href=\"#H2691827718\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of specific regimens'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recommendations on ART management in patients with HAND are largely based on expert opinion rather than empirical evidence and are controversial because of the overall paucity of high quality data comparing particular drug regimens. (See <a href=\"#H1231871347\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since HAD is pathologically characterized by local replication of HIV in the CNS, the rationale for effective ART penetration into the CNS is most pertinent to patients with HAD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For initial ART of untreated patients with HAD, we suggest choosing a regimen that optimizes CNS penetration (CPE score) as well as virologic potency and tolerability (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H3369452128\" class=\"local\">'Patients with milder deficits'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prevailing management issue for patients who are on suppressive ART but present with neurocognitive impairment is whether there is any neurocognitive benefit to modifying their ART regimen.

We then evaluate the CSF for the presence of detectable HIV. If present, this suggests symptomatic viral escape syndrome. For such patients, we suggest tailoring the ART regimen to target the viral population in the CSF (either by genotype of the CSF HIV or by CPE (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F89401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89401 \">table 1</a>)) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
