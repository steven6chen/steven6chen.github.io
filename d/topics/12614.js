Urothelial carcinoma accounts for 90 percent of bladder cancers in the United States and Europe. In other areas of the world, non-urothelial carcinomas are more frequent. Much less commonly, urothelial carcinomas arise in the renal pelvis, ureter, or urethra.</p><p>Bladder cancer occurs primarily in older adults, with three-fourths or more of new cases detected in patients greater than 65 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-bladder-cancer-in-older-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Older adults appear to have a higher mortality due to urothelial carcinoma than younger individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-bladder-cancer-in-older-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In a study from the United States Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, five-year survival rates declined progressively from 84 percent in those between 65 and 69 years to 60 percent in those 85 and older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-bladder-cancer-in-older-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>One feature that may contribute to differences in biology for urothelial cancer in older versus younger patients is the duration of exposure to carcinogens such as cigarette smoke, dye stuffs, metals, and petroleum products. A longer period of exposure may contribute to the development of additional mutations.</p><p>This topic discusses the evaluation and management of older individuals with urothelial cancer. More general discussions of the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of bladder cancer and an overview of treatment are presented separately.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-bladder-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of bladder cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-initial-approach-and-management-of-urothelial-bladder-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the initial approach and management of urothelial bladder cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9776369\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY IN OLDER ADULTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An accurate assessment of an older individual's overall health and physiologic status is critical prior to defining the treatment approach.</p><p>Older adults have important age-related decreases in physiologic reserves that may alter their tolerance to disease and its treatment. These factors need to be considered in planning an optimal therapeutic approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-bladder-cancer-in-older-adults/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac output declines by approximately 1 percent each year after age 25 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-bladder-cancer-in-older-adults/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. This decline may be exacerbated by a long history of cigarette smoking, with its consequent cardiovascular complications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age-related changes in pulmonary function contribute to <span class=\"nowrap\">ventilation/perfusion</span> mismatch, with reductions in pulmonary function, pulmonary compliance, and alveolar septal loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-bladder-cancer-in-older-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Such changes are also exacerbated by smoking.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With increasing age, the kidneys have decreases in weight, number of functioning nephrons, and cortical volume; renal blood flow is reduced beyond what would be expected from reducing cardiac output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-bladder-cancer-in-older-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Furthermore, assessment of renal function is complicated by the reduction in lean muscle mass that is part of the aging process. Thus, serum creatinine and creatinine clearance may be less accurate reflectors of true renal function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the gastrointestinal tract, changes include reduced peristalsis and slowed gastric emptying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-bladder-cancer-in-older-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], reduced hepatic blood flow, and reduced capacity for hepatic repair after insults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-bladder-cancer-in-older-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Altered gastrointestinal function is frequently exacerbated by the range of medications prescribed to older adult patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The bone marrow involutes with advancing age, with a reduction in stem cell function and reparative capacity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-bladder-cancer-in-older-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] often associated with anemia. Thus, recovery time from chemotherapy may be slowed, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the severity of myelosuppression may be increased.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a progressive loss of neuronal tissue, sometimes associated with reduced cognitive function, reduced peripheral nerve function, and a range of neuropsychiatric disorders.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many older adult patients suffer from a range of biochemical and metabolic problems, most commonly diabetes and changes in lipid metabolism, and these features may be compounded by social factors that cause depression, malnutrition, and impaired access to medical care.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9776376\"><span class=\"h1\">FACTORS THAT MAY INFLUENCE TREATMENT DECISIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple factors influence the approach to bladder cancer treatment among older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-bladder-cancer-in-older-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Key items include the physical and mental fitness of the patient, fiscal issues, and support available from family and friends.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Comorbidity &ndash; The importance of comorbidity was shown in a study of more than 2400 patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer, 38 percent of whom were 75 years and older, and 63 percent of whom had at least one serious comorbid condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-bladder-cancer-in-older-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Higher comorbidity was independently associated with a decision not to undergo cystectomy. Patients with one comorbidity were 30 percent less likely to undergo surgery than patients with no comorbidities, and those with two or more comorbidities were 40 percent less likely to have surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Functional status &ndash; Functional status is an important predictor of outcomes in older individuals, including the ability to independently perform the activities of daily living, mobility, and gait speed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical context &ndash; The clinical context is critical as well; specifically, is the cancer potentially curable, is it symptomatic with symptoms that can be effectively palliated, and what is the likely morbidity of treatment and is it appropriate for an aged patient? When considering older adult patients, our approach to treatment planning is to start by considering the clinical context:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Curable by local therapy (radiation, surgery)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Curable by a combined-modality approach that incorporates chemotherapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Symptomatic but not curable</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Asymptomatic but not curable</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Preterminal or terminal</p><p/><p>Based upon this, we consider the patient's physical and mental status, comorbidities (including their specific types and severity), anticipated life expectancy, and socioeconomic issues, such as fiscal and support factors. For example, many older adult patients may have adequate health insurance, but treatment may be limited by ancillary costs or the lack of support or transportation.</p><p>At our institution, we have developed a Senior Oncology Program involving specialist geriatricians, oncologists, and allied health professional support staff who are able to assist in the evaluation of these issues. Based upon these inputs, we formulate a multidisciplinary treatment plan that is tailored to the needs and wishes of the patient and family.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9776382\"><span class=\"h2\">Comprehensive geriatric assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Older patients should undergo a formal comprehensive geriatric assessment, particularly if surgery is being considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Comprehensive geriatric assessment for patients with cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This assessment includes an evaluation of factors that predispose the patient to increased toxicity; it should include functional status, comorbidities, cognitive problems, lack of social support, hearing impairment, history of falls, and <span class=\"nowrap\">diet/nutritional</span> status. The presence of these factors is associated with an increase in six-month mortality and postdischarge institutionalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-bladder-cancer-in-older-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] and a 50 percent increase in postoperative complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-bladder-cancer-in-older-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Beyond its ability to predict complications related to treatment, a comprehensive geriatric assessment may identify issues that otherwise would not be recognized. For example, in one large study, up to 40 percent of patients were found to have previously undiagnosed issues related to fatigue, nutrition, or functional impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-bladder-cancer-in-older-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Other pragmatic issues, particularly when radiation therapy or chemoradiotherapy are being considered, include the ability of the older adult patient physically to be positioned on the table and to tolerate the isolation of the radiation bunker and extended time under beam. This may be of particular concern for the patient with significant cardiopulmonary disorders, severe arthritis, or mild dementia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9776388\"><span class=\"h1\">MEDICALLY FIT PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For older adult patients who are physiologically fit (ie, maintain a good performance status and have limited or no severe comorbidities), treatment planning is generally similar to that of younger patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=frailty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Frailty&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, the context is crucial. The prudent clinician will be much more cautious if the endpoint of treatment is palliation rather than cure. Although older patients may be at a higher risk for treatment-related complications, survival outcomes for medically fit older patients appear to be similar to results in younger patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-bladder-cancer-in-older-adults/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9776394\"><span class=\"h2\">Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For medically fit older patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, the initial treatment typically consists of a complete transurethral resection of visible bladder tumor (TURBT) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F112017\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef112017 \">algorithm 1</a>). For those with intermediate- or high-risk non-muscle invasive disease based upon depth of invasion or histopathology, intravesical therapy (typically Bacillus Calmette-Guerin [BCG]) may be indicated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-initial-approach-and-management-of-urothelial-bladder-cancer#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the initial approach and management of urothelial bladder cancer&quot;, section on 'Non-muscle invasive disease'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-non-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary non-muscle invasive urothelial bladder cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As a practical consideration, added caution must be applied when repeatedly administering BCG or other intravesical therapies in older adult males because of the risk of coincidental benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and the associated risks of creating false passages during repeated catheterization. In addition, older adult males with BPH may have greater difficulty in maintaining the dwell time of intravesical agents that are irritants, such as BCG, and this should be monitored to ensure efficacy of delivered treatment.</p><p>The benefit of aggressive treatment of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer in older patients was shown in a Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) and Medicare study that included almost 24,000 older adult patients (mean age 77 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-bladder-cancer-in-older-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. After adjusting for stage, socioeconomic status, and clinical characteristics, the receipt of adjuvant BCG therapy was associated with an improvement in overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0.87, 95% CI 0.83-0.92), with a trend toward improved bladder cancer-specific survival (odds ratio [OR] 0.90, 95% CI 0.80-1.01). The improvement in survival persisted at 10 years of follow-up. However, only 22 percent of patients were actually treated with BCG within six months of diagnosis, implying a significant negative impact on survival due to ageism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9776400\"><span class=\"h2\">Muscle invasive bladder cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medically fit older patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer should be evaluated by a multidisciplinary group that includes surgical, medical, and radiation oncology input. Treatment options are potentially similar to those for younger patients, depending upon patient and tumor-specific factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113732\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113732 \">algorithm 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-bladder-cancer-in-older-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These may include neoadjuvant chemotherapy, primary cystectomy, or a multimodal approach (eg, TURBT, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-initial-approach-and-management-of-urothelial-bladder-cancer#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the initial approach and management of urothelial bladder cancer&quot;, section on 'Muscle invasive disease'</a>.)</p><p>In general, for patients who will be treated with curative intent, neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by cystectomy is indicated. This recommendation is based upon results of the Southwestern Oncology Group (SWOG) 8710 trial, which demonstrated an increase in median survival from 46 to 77 months with neoadjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinblastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinblastine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> (MVAC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-bladder-cancer-in-older-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Although the median age of patients in the trial was 63, the survival benefit was also seen in patients over 65 years of age. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neoadjuvant-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer#H210939438\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neoadjuvant treatment options for muscle-invasive urothelial bladder cancer&quot;, section on 'Neoadjuvant chemotherapy'</a>.)</p><p>Determining whether an older patient is sufficiently robust to tolerate surgery and neoadjuvant chemotherapy can be particularly challenging. A contemporary analysis found that 90-day mortality following cystectomy appeared to increase with age, with mortality rates of 6, 10, and 15 percent for patients aged 66 to 69, 70 to 79, and &gt;80 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-bladder-cancer-in-older-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Surgical morbidity can be reduced by the choice of diversion. For example, removal of the bladder with simple placement of an ileal conduit is a shorter operation with less potential morbidity than that associated with the creation of a neobladder or a pouch that can be catheterized. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-diversion-and-reconstruction-following-cystectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary diversion and reconstruction following cystectomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Similarly, the MVAC regimen is more toxic than the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-bladder-cancer-in-older-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], although the latter regimen has never been proven to have equivalence in anticancer efficacy in the neoadjuvant setting, despite marked similarity for metastatic disease.

Patients with a limited life expectancy and those who wish to avoid treatment-related toxicity should be offered supportive care and referral for palliative care services.

Although typically performed under general anesthesia, this can be performed under regional anesthesia if medical conditions warrant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with intermediate- or high-risk disease, our approach is to proceed with intravesical therapy for those at low risk for complications, especially if their life expectancy is measured in years. Intravesical therapy usually will require only a catheter and not necessarily repeated cystoscopy, and as such, can be performed in the office.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with serious comorbidities <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> who are not candidates for treatment for whatever reason, we follow expectantly, if asymptomatic, or refer for palliative and supportive care in the event of symptomatic deterioration.

In general, the initial management will be either a primary cystectomy or the administration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, depending on the patient's level of frailty and the nature of the comorbid conditions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-initial-approach-and-management-of-urothelial-bladder-cancer#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the initial approach and management of urothelial bladder cancer&quot;, section on 'Muscle invasive disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9776424\"><span class=\"h3\">Cystectomy and other options</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medically frail patients are at significant risk for postoperative complications and mortality at 90 days following radical cystectomy. Therefore, a careful assessment is critical in order to evaluate whether patients are candidates for surgery. One nomogram that combines age and the Charlson Comorbidity index (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72047\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72047 \">table 1</a>) appears to predict 90-day mortality accurately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-bladder-cancer-in-older-adults/abstract/10,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,22</a>] and exceeds the predictive ability of the American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) score (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F87504\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87504 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who are deemed medically appropriate candidates for surgery, a cystectomy should be performed, although the specific approach may need to be carefully considered. Less complex procedures require less physiological reserve, require less operating time, and have a lower risk of blood loss, and thus, may be favored for older or less robust patients. Other factors, such as whether the patient has the manual dexterity to self-catheterize an ileostomy, must also be considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radical-cystectomy-and-bladder-sparing-treatments-for-urothelial-bladder-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radical cystectomy and bladder-sparing treatments for urothelial bladder cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who are deemed medically inoperable or who refuse surgery, chemoradiation may be a reasonable alternative. Some older adult patients with invasive bladder cancer can be cured by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> plus chemoradiotherapy (using cisplatin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-bladder-cancer-in-older-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] or a fluoropyrimidine-based combination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-bladder-cancer-in-older-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]) or at least effectively palliated for sustained periods measured in months to years. Retrospective pooled data from six Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) trials suggest a slight decrease in completion of induction chemotherapy based on age (75 years or older), as part of a bladder-preserving regimen, but no difference with respect to completion of a radiation dose of 60 Gy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-bladder-cancer-in-older-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Given the poor prognosis associated with the detection of recurrent or metastatic disease, any decision should take into account the goals and preferences of the patient as well. At a very practical level, we recommend the use of single-agent chemotherapy or palliative radiation therapy for salvage following failure of first-line chemotherapy. The balance of efficacy and toxicity is more favorable with this approach.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9776442\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bladder cancer is a common disease in older adults, with over three-fourths of new cases occurring in patients older than 65 years. These older patients also appear to have higher mortality after a diagnosis of bladder cancer. (See <a href=\"#H9776362\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple factors impact adherence to treatment guidelines for bladder cancer, including older age, prior treatment for bladder cancer, and the presence of greater comorbidities. In order to provide more appropriate treatment, older patients should undergo a geriatric assessment. (See <a href=\"#H9776376\" class=\"local\">'Factors that may influence treatment decisions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who are physiologically fit (ie, maintain a good performance status and have limited or no severe comorbidities), the approach to treatment is the same as for younger patients. Although older patients may be at a higher risk for treatment-related complications, survival outcomes for medically fit older patients appear similar to that of younger patients. (See <a href=\"#H9776388\" class=\"local\">'Medically fit patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For those with non-muscle invasive disease, treatment generally consists of maximal transurethral resection of visible bladder tumor (TURBT). Depending upon risk stratification, this may be followed by intravesical therapy (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin [BCG]). (See <a href=\"#H9776394\" class=\"local\">'Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For those with muscle invasive disease, neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by cystectomy is generally preferred, although this approach may be modified based upon patient-specific factors. (See <a href=\"#H9776400\" class=\"local\">'Muscle invasive bladder cancer'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For medically frail patients (eg, those with cognitive impairment or comorbidities), the risks of surgery, radiation therapy (RT), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chemotherapy must be considered in the development of an individualized treatment plan. We refer such patients to our multidisciplinary Senior Oncology Clinic for geriatric assessment as part of treatment planning. Patients with a limited life expectancy and those who wish to avoid treatment-related toxicity should be offered supportive care and referral for palliative care services. Our approach is as follows (see <a href=\"#H9776406\" class=\"local\">'Medically frail patients'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with non-muscle invasive disease, TURBT is generally appropriate, assuming the patient can tolerate the anesthesia and cystoscopy. For those with intermediate- or high-risk disease, our approach is to proceed with intravesical therapy for those at low risk for complications, especially if their life expectancy is measured in years. (See <a href=\"#H9776412\" class=\"local\">'Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For those with muscle invasive disease, the approach to treatment is complex and requires a careful integration of patient-specific factors. Depending upon the patient's comorbidities, general fitness, and desires, choices of therapy may range from neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus cystectomy, to simpler approaches for potentially curative therapy, or to palliative care. (See <a href=\"#H9776418\" class=\"local\">'Muscle invasive bladder cancer'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The life expectancy for patients with metastatic disease is poor, and chemotherapy is the primary modality specifically directed against the cancer. For robust older adult patients, we recommend gemcitabine-cisplatin or the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinblastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinblastine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> (MVAC) regimen. For symptomatic frail patients, including those patients ineligible for cisplatin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atezolizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atezolizumab</a> or single-agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a> can lead to meaningful responses. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients who progress after chemotherapy or within 12 months of adjuvant or neoadjuvant platinum-based therapy, checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy targeting the programmed cell death 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">(PD-1)/programmed</span> cell death 1 ligand (PD-L1) pathway may provide clinical benefit. Regardless of age, there are no standard third-line therapies for patients who have progressed despite prior treatment. Therefore, for patients in this situation, any decision should take into account the goals and preferences of the patient as well.
