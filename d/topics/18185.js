The expression of the disease varies substantially among individuals and within families. Some individuals with TSC may demonstrate only dermatologic features of the disease while others may develop more serious neurologic or systemic manifestations.</p><p>The management and prognosis of TSC will be reviewed here. Other aspects of TSC are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tuberous sclerosis complex: Genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-manifestations-of-tuberous-sclerosis-complex\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal manifestations of tuberous sclerosis complex&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberous-sclerosis-complex-associated-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tuberous sclerosis complex associated lymphangioleiomyomatosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H140859516\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of TSC is directed at its neurologic and systemic manifestations, which include seizures, TSC-associated neuropsychiatric disorders, brain tumors, skin lesions, renal disease, pulmonary disease, cardiac involvement, and an increased risk of malignant tumors. Information regarding baseline evaluations, ongoing surveillance, and therapeutic interventions for these problems is provided in the sections that follow. Ideally, children with TSC should be cared for by specialized TSC clinics that have been established in many countries to address the medical needs and psychosocial challenges of affected patients, their families and caregivers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H140860313\"><span class=\"h2\">Epilepsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common and difficult aspect of management in TSC is the detection and treatment of seizures (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tuberous sclerosis complex: Genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Seizures'</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H343450817\"><span class=\"h3\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many children with TSC develop focal seizures and infantile spasms during infancy. Therefore, international TSC guidelines recommend that parents should be educated to recognize these types of seizures even if none have occurred at the time of initial diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, all pediatric patients with TSC should have a baseline electroencephalography (EEG) even if seizures are not evident. Children who have an abnormal EEG, particularly those with features of TSC-associated neuropsychiatric disorders, should have a follow-up 24-hour video EEG to look for subclinical seizure activity or epileptiform discharges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-management-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>TSC guidelines recommend routine EEG monitoring for individuals with TSC who have known or suspected seizure activity. The frequency of such monitoring should be determined by clinical need rather than a defined time interval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The guidelines note that prolonged video EEG (&ge;24 hours) is appropriate when seizure occurrence is unclear or when there are unexplained changes in sleep, behavior, or cognitive or neurologic function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H343450823\"><span class=\"h3\">Seizure control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Appropriate selection of an anticonvulsant drug depends upon the type of seizure:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many children with TSC have infantile spasms, which are hard to control. In patients with TSC, the benefit of corticotropin (ACTH, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=corticotropin-injection-gel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">corticotropin injection gel</a>), the mainstay of medical treatment for infantile spasms, is similar to that of patients without TSC, although patients with TSC relapse more often. There is limited evidence that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vigabatrin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vigabatrin</a> may be more effective than ACTH in treating infantile spasms in patients with TSC. However, all studies of vigabatrin as treatment for infantile spasms suffer from methodologic limitations, the most obvious being small numbers of participants, a paucity of double blind placebo-controlled trials, and an absence of studies comparing ACTH with vigabatrin in patients with TSC. In addition, there is a risk of possible irreversible retinal toxicity with the use of vigabatrin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prognosis of infantile spasms&quot;, section on 'Corticotropin (ACTH)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prognosis-of-infantile-spasms#H143072126\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prognosis of infantile spasms&quot;, section on 'Tuberous sclerosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Given the available data, we suggest ACTH for initial treatment of infantile spasms in children with TSC. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vigabatrin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Vigabatrin</a> is an alternative. However, other experts prefer vigabatrin as initial therapy in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1,3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,4</a>]. As an example, guidelines from the International Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Consensus Group recommend vigabatrin as first-line therapy for infantile spasms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The management of infantile spasms is discussed in detail separately.

For patients who become seizure-free for at least two years with anticonvulsant treatment, tapering off medication is a reasonable consideration, with 30 of 33 such patients remaining seizure free in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-management-and-prognosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Unfortunately, approximately 60 percent of patients with TSC and epilepsy develop medically intractable epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-management-and-prognosis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. For such patients, treatment options include a ketogenic diet (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-ketogenic-diet-and-other-dietary-therapies-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The ketogenic diet and other dietary therapies for the treatment of epilepsy&quot;</a>), vagus nerve stimulation, epilepsy surgery, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=everolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">everolimus</a>.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vagus nerve stimulation is a treatment option for patients who are not deemed surgical candidates or who have refractory seizures after epilepsy surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-management-and-prognosis/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. The efficacy of vagus nerve stimulation for patients with TSC and epilepsy appears to be in the same range as that seen for patients with other causes of medically refractory epilepsy that is not surgically amenable.

A systematic review of 177 published cases reported that epilepsy surgery led to seizure remission in 57 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-management-and-prognosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Seizure frequency was reduced in 90 percent of patients. Developmental delay and tonic seizures were potential risk factors for a less favorable outcome after surgery. Concordance between the predominant interictal focus and the site of ictal electrographic onset may predict a better surgical outcome. Increased use of sophisticated neuroimaging techniques may improve the efficacy of surgical treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-management-and-prognosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Other EEG findings that may predict refractory epilepsy include higher hypsarrhythmia severity scores, background disorganization, and absent normal sleep patterns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-management-and-prognosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=everolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Everolimus</a>, an mTOR inhibitor, significantly reduced seizures in patients with TSC and treatment-resistant epilepsy, as shown in the randomized, double blind EXIST-3 trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-management-and-prognosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The 18-week trial enrolled 366 subjects (ages 2 to 56 years; median age 10 years) with TSC and treatment-resistant seizures. Subjects were maintained on their prestudy antiepileptic drugs and were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to placebo, low-exposure everolimus, or high-exposure everolimus. The dose of everolimus was adjusted during an initial six-week titration phase to attain trough everolimus concentration levels of 3 to 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> for the low-exposure group and 9 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> for the high-exposure group. The following observations were made:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The proportion of subjects achieving a &ge;50 percent reduction in seizure frequency was significantly greater for the low- and high-exposure <a href=\"topic.htm?path=everolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">everolimus</a> groups (28 and 40 percent respectively, versus 15 percent for the placebo group).

Similar to other studies, the most common adverse events associated with everolimus were stomatitis, diarrhea, and pyrexia. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">While longer-term data are needed, these results suggest that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=everolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">everolimus</a> is an effective and safe adjunctive treatment option for patients with TSC and treatment-resistant epilepsy. They also supplement the evidence that everolimus and mTOR inhibitors are effective for treating various manifestations of TSC, including symptomatic subependymal giant cell tumors, renal angiomyolipomas, pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and facial angiofibromas.

The international TSC guidelines recommend more frequent MRI brain scans for patients with asymptomatic SGCTs that are large, growing, or causing ventricular enlargement, and for patients with developmental or cognitive disabilities who are unable to reliably report subtle symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The patients and their families should be informed about the potential of new symptoms.</p><p>MRI is the test of choice for screening patients with TSC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-management-and-prognosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Head CT (or head ultrasound in neonates or infants when fontanels are open) may be used if MRI is not available or cannot be performed, but the overall sensitivity of CT and ultrasound is suboptimal compared with MRI. Head CT is more sensitive than MRI for detecting calcified subependymal nodules, but this advantage has no clinical utility. Furthermore, MRI is preferred to CT in order to minimize radiation exposure in syndromes such as TSC that predispose to cancer and require multiple imaging. </p><p>Contrast enhancement on MRI or CT is seen with a majority of subependymal nodules and SGCTs but does not appear to provide any significant prognostic information. Nevertheless, we suggest obtaining screening MRI scans with and without contrast, in agreement with current guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The duration of monitoring for new brain lesions is uncertain. In a series of 134 patients seen at a single center, no patient over the age of 20 required surgical resection of a SGCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-management-and-prognosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In addition, it is atypical for a patient who has been screened every one to three years to present with a new SGCT after the age of 21. As a result, it may be appropriate to diminish the frequency of cranial MRI in young adults without evidence for SGCT. In comparison, a SGCT diagnosed at a younger age may not become symptomatic until many years later, and would require routine monitoring throughout life. International TSC guidelines are in general agreement with these conclusions, stating that individuals without SGCTs by the age of 25 years do not need continued surveillance imaging, whereas those with asymptomatic SGCTs in childhood should continue to be monitored by MRI for life because of the possibility of growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H140858567\"><span class=\"h3\">Brain tumor treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two main treatment options for brain tumors associated with TSC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-management-and-prognosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical resection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical therapy with mTOR inhibitors such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=everolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">everolimus</a></p><p/><p>For patients with TSC who are good candidates, we suggest surgical resection for acutely symptomatic subependymal giant cell tumors (SGCTs), in agreement with international guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In certain cases, a cerebrospinal fluid shunt may also be necessary.

Patients who have a solitary, unilateral, and totally resectable SGCT without high surgical risk factors or other comorbidities may benefit from surgery, while patients with multisystem involvement <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> multiple or infiltrating SGCTs that are not amenable to total resection may be more likely to benefit from mTOR inhibitor treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Despite their benign nature, some SGCTs show massive hemorrhage, rapid growth, and local recurrence following resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-management-and-prognosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H314611362\" class=\"local\">'Cardiac problems'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TSC is highly variable in severity. Some individuals may demonstrate only dermatologic features of the disease while others may develop more serious neurologic or systemic manifestations. Complications in major organ systems are the predominant source of morbidity in adolescents and young adults with TSC, and they contribute to an increased incidence of early death. (See <a href=\"#H140859655\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H753462795\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate, Inc. would like to acknowledge Dr. Sharon Plon and Dr. James Owens, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review. </p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Krueger DA, Northrup H, International Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Consensus Group.
