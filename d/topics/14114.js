Most such women are not of childbearing age, or because of the associated anovulatory state, they are infertile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-pre-existing-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, women with less severe disease (eg, from chronic viral hepatitis) or those with noncirrhotic portal hypertension (eg, from congenital hepatic fibrosis or portal vein thrombosis) do not have diminished fertility and may become pregnant. In order to avoid unintended pregnancy, women with chronic liver disease should be counseled to use contraception, and the method of contraception provided must take the specific liver disease into account. Furthermore, patients contemplating pregnancy should have preconception counseling and disease-specific risk evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-preconception-office-visit\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The preconception office visit&quot;</a>.) </p><p>When a woman with chronic liver disease becomes pregnant, two separate issues arise: (1) what will be the effect of the liver disease or its treatment on the pregnancy and fetus, and (2) how will the pregnancy affect the health of the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-pre-existing-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>This topic will review pregnancy in women with pre-existing chronic liver disease, with the exception of chronic hepatitis B, including the effects on the fetus and on the patient.

Some women with cirrhosis can sustain pregnancy without any worsening of hepatic function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-pre-existing-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], whereas others may develop jaundice from progressive liver failure, ascites, and hepatic coma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-pre-existing-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Variceal bleeding can occur in up to 38 percent of pregnant women with cirrhosis, and in up to 78 percent of women with known varices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-pre-existing-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Spontaneous rupture of a splenic artery aneurysm is a rare complication of pregnancy in women with portal hypertension and is also a known complication of pregnancy in patients without portal hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-pre-existing-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

There was one fatality during pregnancy that was the result of variceal bleeding. Complications were associated with higher Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores (but not MELD-Na or Child-Pugh scores) at the time of conception. The MELD scoring system is a prognostic model for estimating disease severity and survival in patients with chronic liver disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The increase in total blood volume associated with pregnancy may worsen portal hypertension. However, prospective studies of the effect of pregnancy on portal hypertension and its complications are not available. Variceal hemorrhage during pregnancy or labor has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-pre-existing-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. One method to avoid straining during delivery is to place an epidural early in labor and allow the infant to descend with uterine contractions alone. Delivery is then assisted using low forceps or vacuum extraction.

In a retrospective cohort study of 31 women with cirrhosis, the rate of at least one obstetrical complication (ie preterm delivery, preeclampsia, placental abruption, small-for gestational age, and fetal or neonatal death) was higher in women with cirrhosis compared with a control group without cirrhosis, matched for maternal age, parity, and body mass index (61 versus 12 percent, OR 11.5, CI 95% 4.7-28.4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-pre-existing-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Spontaneous fetal loss occurred in 26 percent of pregnancies (19 percent were miscarriages prior to 20 weeks gestation, and 6 percent were stillbirths after 20 weeks gestation). It should be noted that published reports may be biased toward complications, leading to an overestimation of the risk. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4142672751\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessing risk for variceal bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One approach to women with cirrhosis who desire pregnancy is to perform an upper endoscopy to look for varices before pregnancy. If present, patients should be informed of the increased risk of gastrointestinal hemorrhage with pregnancy. If not previously done, upper endoscopy should be performed in the second trimester. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prediction-of-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prediction of variceal hemorrhage in patients with cirrhosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients at high risk for variceal hemorrhage should receive primary prophylaxis with non-selective beta blockers (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nadolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nadolol</a>). Prophylaxis with beta blockers may be continued during pregnancy, but newborns should be monitored during the first days of life because of risks of hypoglycemia and bradycardia. All patients should be monitored by a maternal fetal medicine specialist.

However, some studies evaluating the impact of chronic HCV on hepatic, maternal, and fetal outcomes have suggested potential harms.</p><p>In a population-based cohort study, infants of HCV-positive mothers were more likely to be of low birthweight (odds ratio [OR] 2.2; 95% CI 1.2-3.8), small for gestational age (OR 1.5; 95% CI 1.0-2.1), need assisted ventilation (OR 2.4; 95% CI 1.4-3.9), or require neonatal intensive care (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.9-4.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-pre-existing-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. There were nonsignificant trends for low APGAR scores (OR 1.5, 95% CI 0.9-2.5), prematurity (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.0-2.4), and neonatal jaundice (OR 1.3, 95% CI 0.8-1.9) being associated with HCV. However, not all studies have detected these associations, and additional data are needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-pre-existing-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>].</p><p>An improvement in serum aminotransferase concentrations during pregnancy has been observed in some reports. As an example, in a series that included 266 pregnant women who were HCV RNA positive, the proportion of those with an elevated serum alanine aminotransferase level decreased from 56 percent at the beginning of pregnancy to 7 percent by the third trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-pre-existing-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The levels then returned to 55 percent six months after delivery. The authors hypothesized that these changes may have been due to the effects of pregnancy leading to a decrease in the mothers' immune responses against HCV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-pre-existing-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Similar results were noted in a smaller series of 26 patients that also noted a rise in HCV RNA titer during the third trimester despite the decline in the serum alanine aminotransferase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-pre-existing-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>These observations suggest that women who are found to be infected with HCV during pregnancy and have normal serum aminotransferase concentrations should undergo repeat testing six months or more after pregnancy before concluding that the serum aminotransferases remain normal. Transient fluctuations may occur postpartum.</p><p>Studies have had conflicting results regarding the effect of pregnancy on histologic progression in women with chronic HCV. At least one study suggested that pregnancy may be associated with worsening histology on liver biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-pre-existing-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Twelve HCV positive women who underwent liver biopsies before and after pregnancy were compared with 12 matched HCV positive controls who underwent paired liver biopsies but did not have an intervening pregnancy. Women who had been pregnant were more likely to have worsening of the necroinflammatory and fibrosis scores on liver biopsy compared with women who had not been pregnant. By contrast, another study found that pregnancy was associated with improvement in long-term progression of fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-pre-existing-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Transmission of HCV from the mother to the newborn can occur but appears to be much less efficient than for hepatitis B.

Obviously, such heroic surgery must be considered with extreme care. If the condition prompting transplantation is caused by the pregnancy (eg, acute fatty liver of pregnancy), then prompt diagnosis followed by interruption of the pregnancy with maximal support of the mother is the treatment of choice. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H146896108\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy has a variable effect in women with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Worsening jaundice with progressive liver failure, ascites, and hepatic coma can occur, but some women with cirrhosis can sustain pregnancy without any worsening of hepatic function. In addition, the incidence of stillbirths and premature deliveries may be increased. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Cirrhosis and portal hypertension in pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The increase in total blood volume associated with pregnancy may worsen pre-existing portal hypertension. One approach to women with known cirrhosis who desire pregnancy is to perform an upper endoscopy to look for varices before pregnancy (or during the second trimester if not performed prior to pregnancy). If present, patients should be informed of the increased risk of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage with pregnancy. Patients at high risk for variceal hemorrhage should receive primary prophylaxis with non-selective beta blockers (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nadolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nadolol</a>). Newborns whose mothers were receiving beta blockers should be monitored during the first days of life because of risks of hypoglycemia and bradycardia. (See <a href=\"#H4142672751\" class=\"local\">'Assessing risk for variceal bleeding'</a> above.).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women chronically infected with hepatitis C virus can have an uneventful pregnancy without worsening of liver disease or other adverse effects on the mother or fetus, though some studies have suggested potential harms.
