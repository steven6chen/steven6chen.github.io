These methods prevent functioning sperm from entering the female reproductive tract. Female-controlled pericoital contraceptive methods include the diaphragm, cervical cap, spermicides, sponge, and the female condom. The male condom is the main male-controlled pericoital contraceptive.</p><p>This topic will review the diaphragm, cervical cap, spermicides, and sponge. Information on female condoms, male condoms, and choosing a contraceptive method is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=female-condoms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Female condoms&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=male-condoms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Male condoms&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contraceptive-counseling-and-selection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contraceptive counseling and selection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H658049088\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF ACTION AND NOMENCLATURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although commonly thought of as barrier methods, the diaphragm, cervical cap, and the contraceptive sponge largely function by maintaining a reservoir of spermicide against the cervix. Spermicidal foams, gels, creams, films, or suppositories provide contraception by immobilizing sperm, thus creating a chemical &quot;barrier&quot; against normal assent of sperm into the upper genital tract. As the diaphragm, cervical cap, sponge, and spermicide are only used at the time of intercourse, we will refer to these methods as &quot;pericoital contraceptives&quot; throughout. (See <a href=\"#H553979233\" class=\"local\">'Spermicide'</a> below.)</p><p>True barrier contraceptives are the female and male condoms. They provide a physical barrier to migration of sperm from the vagina to the upper reproductive tract, where fertilization occurs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=female-condoms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Female condoms&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=male-condoms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Male condoms&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4270019398\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOOSING A PERICOITAL CONTRACEPTIVE METHOD</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3783137689\"><span class=\"h2\">Pericoital versus other contraceptive methods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In choosing a method of contraception, the advantages and disadvantages of the method need to be assessed and compared with advantages and disadvantages of alternative methods. For the primary indication of pregnancy prevention, pericoital contraceptives are considered second tier (diaphragm) or third tier (cervical cap, contraceptive sponge, and spermicide) in efficacy below long-acting reversible (LARC) and short-acting reversible hormonal (SARC) contraceptive methods (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57795\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57795 \">figure 1</a>).

While a causal relationship between multiparity and higher pericoital contraception failure is not clear, there is biological plausibility in that the larger multiparous cervix may be more difficult to protect against assent of sperm with the cervical cap and sponge. Contraceptive decision-making should take this decreased efficacy into account.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diaphragm, cervical cap, contraceptive sponge, and spermicides do not protect against STI acquisition, including herpes simplex virus (HSV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), because they do not separate penile skin and secretions from the vaginal epithelium the way that male and female condoms do. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=male-condoms#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Male condoms&quot;, section on 'Protection from STIs'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=female-condoms#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Female condoms&quot;, section on 'Sexually transmitted infections'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Requires motivation at every act of intercourse and some skill to use.

(See <a href=\"#H101749310\" class=\"local\">'Refitting and replacing'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diaphragm and cervical cap require concomitant use of a spermicide to maximize prevention of pregnancy. The only available spermicide in the United States (US), nonoxynol-9 (N-9), can cause vaginal irritation (eg, burning, itching, or rash or asymptomatic irritation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericoital-contraception-diaphragm-cervical-cap-spermicide-and-sponge/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. Skin breakdown associated with this irritation can be associated with an increased risk of acquiring HIV from an infected partner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericoital-contraception-diaphragm-cervical-cap-spermicide-and-sponge/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Side effects and complications of diaphragm use'</a> below.) </p><p/><p>As a result of these disadvantages, women discontinue pericoital contraceptives because of method dissatisfaction at higher rates than they discontinue other contraceptive methods. An analysis of the 2002 United States National Survey of Family Growth reported method discontinuation rates of 52 percent for cervical cap or diaphragm users, 48 percent for sponge users, and 39 percent for spermicide users, compared with 36 percent for IUD users and 29 percent for pill users in the same study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericoital-contraception-diaphragm-cervical-cap-spermicide-and-sponge/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In a survey study of current and former diaphragm users, women who stopped using the diaphragm cited difficulty inserting or removing the diaphragm (51 percent), dislike of leaving the diaphragm inside the vagina (47 percent), and wanting a more effective method for preventing pregnancy (44 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericoital-contraception-diaphragm-cervical-cap-spermicide-and-sponge/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2451039899\"><span class=\"h2\">Selection among pericoital contraceptive methods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In deciding among the contraceptive diaphragm, cervical cap, sponge, or spermicidal agents, we discuss the method failure rates, cost, and product availability with the patient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57795\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57795 \">figure 1</a>). Additionally, comprehensive care for a sexually active patient includes sexually transmitted infection (STI) risk assessment and a discussion of STI-preventative behaviors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericoital-contraception-diaphragm-cervical-cap-spermicide-and-sponge/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. While the diaphragm and cervical cap may decrease risk of cervical and upper genital tract infections (eg, pelvic inflammatory disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericoital-contraception-diaphragm-cervical-cap-spermicide-and-sponge/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], only the male and female condoms prevent lower genital-tract infections and transmission of HIV. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=male-condoms#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Male condoms&quot;, section on 'Protection from STIs'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=female-condoms#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Female condoms&quot;, section on 'Sexually transmitted infections'</a>.) </p><p>For women who desire pericoital contraception over LARC or hormonal SARC methods, we suggest a diaphragm used in conjunction with spermicide. This combination has the lowest typical-use pregnancy rate compared with the other pericoital contraceptives (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57795\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57795 \">figure 1</a>). However, as contraceptive selection includes many patient preferences, we defer to the patient's wishes for the final choice. </p><p>Lastly, we review the availability of emergency contraception in case the woman is concerned about method nonuse or failure (eg, the diaphragm, cervical cap, or sponge is displaced from the cervix after use). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-contraception\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency contraception&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1125962343\"><span class=\"h2\">Women who choose pericoital contraception</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Less than one percent of US contraceptive users rely on the diaphragm, contraceptive cap, spermicide, contraceptive sponge and the female condom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericoital-contraception-diaphragm-cervical-cap-spermicide-and-sponge/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Women who rely on the diaphragm, cervical cap, sponge, or spermicide typically desire a woman-controlled and hormone-free option that is used on-demand, inexpensive, and readily available. A study that compared current with former diaphragm users reported that older women in monogamous relationships were more likely to choose the diaphragm and use it successfully [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericoital-contraception-diaphragm-cervical-cap-spermicide-and-sponge/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A survey of women aged 15 to 44 between 2011 and 2013 reported that less than 0.1 percent of women were using a diaphragm during the study period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericoital-contraception-diaphragm-cervical-cap-spermicide-and-sponge/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1666356771\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAPHRAGM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diaphragm is a reusable female contraceptive device consisting of a soft dome-shaped cup with a flexible rim. Diaphragms are available in single-size (one size fits most (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F116578\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef116578 \">figure 2</a>)) and multisize (must be fit to the patient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69595\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69595 \">picture 1</a>)) options. Diaphragms are made of silicone in the United States (US), but latex diaphragms may be available elsewhere. Diaphragms do not protect against acquiring sexually transmitted infections. All diaphragms are designed to be used with spermicide foam, gel, or cream. (See <a href=\"#H553979233\" class=\"local\">'Spermicide'</a> below.) </p><p>Among women who practice contraception, the proportion who use the diaphragm is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericoital-contraception-diaphragm-cervical-cap-spermicide-and-sponge/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Its use is not as popular as it once was, probably due to the higher contraceptive effectiveness, greater convenience, more privacy of hormonal contraceptives and long-acting reversible contraception (intrauterine devices and contraceptive implant), and better protection against sexually transmitted diseases afforded by male and female condoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericoital-contraception-diaphragm-cervical-cap-spermicide-and-sponge/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2012328610\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The annual pregnancy rates per 100 women for traditional diaphragms (ie, fit to the patient) when used in conjunction with spermicide are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericoital-contraception-diaphragm-cervical-cap-spermicide-and-sponge/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Twelve percent with &quot;typical&quot; use</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Six percent with &quot;perfect&quot; use</p><p/><p>These efficacy rates place the diaphragm in the second-tier effectiveness category of contraceptive options (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57795\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57795 \">figure 1</a>). The diaphragm is more effective than the cervical cap and contraceptive sponge. (See <a href=\"#H3911714417\" class=\"local\">'Cervical cap'</a> below and <a href=\"#H410207585\" class=\"local\">'Spermicidal contraceptive sponge'</a> below.)</p><p>The single-size diaphragm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F116578\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef116578 \">figure 2</a>) appears to have comparable efficacy with the traditional diaphragms, but the data are limited. In a trial of 450 couples randomly assigned to use the single-size or standard diaphragm, the six-month pregnancy probability per 100 women was similar (10.4 for single-size users compared with 10.7 for standard users) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericoital-contraception-diaphragm-cervical-cap-spermicide-and-sponge/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Extrapolation of these results to 12 months of use yields an estimated pregnancy rate of 18 per 100 woman-years for the single-size diaphragm. (See <a href=\"#H224658802\" class=\"local\">'Single size'</a> below.)</p><p>Diaphragm efficacy when used without spermicide has never been studied in a well-designed trial, and may be lower [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericoital-contraception-diaphragm-cervical-cap-spermicide-and-sponge/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. A single study including 216 diaphragm users reported lower pregnancy rates with use of spermicide than without (12 versus 19 pregnancies per 100 women with consistent use; 21 versus 29 pregnancies per 100 women with typical use) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericoital-contraception-diaphragm-cervical-cap-spermicide-and-sponge/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Although these differences were not statistically significant, the low power of the study, the trend toward lower pregnancy rates with use of spermicide, and biologic plausibility support the use of spermicide with the diaphragm until stronger evidence of lack of benefit becomes available.</p><p>There are no large trials comparing the efficacy of the different diaphragm materials or spring types.

The single-size diaphragm with lactic-acid gel or N-9 gel reduced the average number of <span class=\"nowrap\">PMS/HPF</span> number to 0, while the diaphragm alone reduced the average number of <span class=\"nowrap\">PMS/HPF</span> to 0.4. It is not yet known if this difference in <span class=\"nowrap\">PMS/HPF</span> will impact the unintended pregnancy rate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1560438320\"><span class=\"h3\">Wide seal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The wide-seal diaphragm has a wide outer flange of soft silicone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69595\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69595 \">picture 1</a>). This creates a greater surface area of contact between the rim and the vagina, and may provide a better seal compared with other types of rims. It is available with either a distortion-free spring that provides arc regardless of where the diaphragm is compressed (commercial name Milex Omniflex Style Diaphragm) or a tension-adjusted spring that folds into an arc for insertion (commercial name Milex Arcing Style Diaphragm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericoital-contraception-diaphragm-cervical-cap-spermicide-and-sponge/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Both devices are available in sizes ranging from 60 to 95 mm, in 5 mm increments, and require a prescription that specifies the device size. Directions for selecting the correct size and fitting the wide seal diaphragm are listed below. (See <a href=\"#H4191620098\" class=\"local\">'Selecting the correct size'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4191620098\"><span class=\"h4\">Selecting the correct size</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multisize diaphragms are manufactured in a range of sizes in 5 mm increments. The sizes most commonly carried in pharmacies range from 65 to 80 mm; larger and smaller sizes are available in some areas. Most women are prescribed diaphragms that are 65 to 75 mm in diameter. As per the name, the single-size diaphragm is available in only one size that fits most women. (See <a href=\"#H224658802\" class=\"local\">'Single size'</a> above.)</p><p>For multisize diaphragms, a diaphragm-fitting kit is used by the clinician to determine the best size for an individual woman's anatomy and to teach the patient how to insert and remove the device. Diaphragm kits come with a range of device sizes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69595\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69595 \">picture 1</a>). The clinic-fitting diaphragm set must be disinfected between use in different patients.</p><p>The appropriate size is the largest available diaphragm that is comfortable when correctly placed. Similar to the single-sized diaphragm, a correctly placed wide-seal diaphragm fits in the space just above the posterior surface of the symphysis pubis and extends to the posterior vaginal fornix, deep in the posterior cul-de-sac, thereby covering the entire cervix. It should press against the lateral vaginal walls, and the dome should be in the correct orientation (hollowed side facing the cervix). It should not be dislodged when the patient is asked to perform a Valsalva maneuver; if the diaphragm is dislodged, the test should be repeated using the next larger size.</p><p>We avoid fitting a diaphragm in women less than six weeks postpartum or less than two weeks following an abortion in the second trimester.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H499322331\"><span class=\"h4\">Fitting procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To begin, the patient places herself in the dorsal lithotomy position, as for a vaginal examination. Her bladder and rectum should be empty and there should be no signs or symptoms of a vaginal or pelvic infection. Two commonly used methods of diaphragm fitting are the measurement and empiric approaches. While we prefer the empiric method, both are reasonable.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Measurement method</strong> &ndash; The clinician inserts either the index finger or both the index finger and the middle finger into the vagina, far enough so that the tip of the longest inserted finger is at the posterior vaginal fornix. Using the thumb of the same hand, the distance at the base of the finger that corresponds to the posterior surface of the symphysis pubis is marked. The hand is removed from the vagina and the distance from the tip of the finger that was in the posterior vaginal fornix to the point marked by the thumb is measured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericoital-contraception-diaphragm-cervical-cap-spermicide-and-sponge/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. If the distance is 70 mm, then the clinician chooses a 70 mm diaphragm to test in the patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The test diaphragm is placed in the vagina, where it should open easily. The cervix should be completely covered by the diaphragm. Using palpation, the fit is assessed by confirming that the anterior surface of the diaphragm fits snugly behind the symphysis pubis, the posterior surface of the diaphragm reaches the posterior vaginal fornix, and undue pressure is not exerted on the vaginal mucosa.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Empiric method</strong> &ndash; The distance between the posterior vaginal fornix and the posterior surface of the symphysis is typically in the range of 70 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericoital-contraception-diaphragm-cervical-cap-spermicide-and-sponge/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Therefore, another approach to sizing a diaphragm is to insert one that is 70 mm in diameter to see if it fits properly. If this diaphragm is too small to fill the space from the posterior vaginal fornix to just above the posterior surface of the symphysis, it is removed and a 75 or 80 mm diaphragm is inserted and tested for goodness of fit. If the 70 mm diaphragm is too large, then a 65 or 60 mm diaphragm is tried.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15257694\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient teaching at time of diaphragm initiation</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37199073\"><span class=\"h3\">Insertion and removal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After an examination to determine that the patient is a candidate for the Caya (see <a href=\"#H1324240864\" class=\"local\">'Fit'</a> above) or to determine the correct size of the wide seal diaphragm (see <a href=\"#H4191620098\" class=\"local\">'Selecting the correct size'</a> above), the patient is taught to partially fill the dome with a spermicide, insert the diaphragm deep into the vagina, position the diaphragm to cover the cervix with the external cervical os placed in the spermicide, and remove the diaphragm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F116387\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef116387 \">form 1</a>).</p><p>Of interested patients, 94 percent are able to correctly place the Caya diaphragm following clinician instruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericoital-contraception-diaphragm-cervical-cap-spermicide-and-sponge/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. These steps are performed under the direct supervision of a trained provider, to ensure that she can successfully perform these key steps. Each woman can determine her own best positions for <span class=\"nowrap\">inserting/removing</span> the diaphragm (standing, squatting, lying down, or standing with one foot up on a stool, bathtub, or toilet) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F85977\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef85977 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p>The steps that need to be mastered are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Place spermicide in the hollow of the dome of the diaphragm and along the rim.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fold the diaphragm using the thumb on one side and the second and third fingers on the other.

If suction or other factors are making it difficult to remove, a finger is inserted between the diaphragm rim and the vaginal wall to break the suction and facilitate removal.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37199079\"><span class=\"h3\">Correct use</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to each use of a diaphragm, the woman should hold the diaphragm to a light and examine the dome for any puncture marks or cracks that would reduce its effectiveness. Alternately, the dome can be filled with water and checked for leaks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 1 tablespoon of spermicide is put into the hollow of the dome and along the circular rim. Only spermicides approved for use with a diaphragm should be used to prevent possible deterioration of the silicone.

The anterior rim should be securely positioned behind the pubic bone. An additional application of foam, gel, or cream spermicide is then placed in the vagina.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ideally, the diaphragm is inserted into the vagina less than two hours prior to sexual intercourse. If placed three to six hours before intercourse, another applicator full of fresh spermicide needs to be inserted into the vagina.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The position of the diaphragm should also be carefully checked after intercourse because it can become dislodged. If it has moved out of the proper position, it should be pushed back into position and spermicide should be reapplied into the vagina.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Each new episode of intercourse while the diaphragm is in place should be preceded by the insertion of fresh spermicide, and the diaphragm should remain in place for at least six hours after the last episode of intercourse to maximize effectiveness. It should be removed by 24 hours after initial placement to minimize the risk of vaginal irritation, UTI, and, rarely, TSS.

The gel, foam, and cream formulation may be used with the diaphragm and cervical cap or may be used alone.

This delay is particularly important for the film and the suppository formulations. Spermicide must be reinserted before every act of intercourse. With repeated applications, these products can leak out of the vagina. When used with a diaphragm or cervical cap, the spermicide should be labeled as compatible with that device. There are slight differences in the application of spermicidal creams, films, foams, gels, and suppositories, which are described in detail in the package insert.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1612161263\"><span class=\"h2\">Relative contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main contraindication is an allergy or sensitivity to the chemicals in the product, particularly N-9, and women who are at risk of exposure to sexually transmitted infections (STI), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.</p><p>Of note, spermicide does not appear to impact pregnancy outcome in the event of accidental exposure.

This association may be due to spermicide-induced local mucosal inflammation or breakdown, which reduces mucosal immunity. This is most common among women who use the spermicide several times a day. In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that women at risk for HIV infection not use N-9 spermicides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericoital-contraception-diaphragm-cervical-cap-spermicide-and-sponge/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

A nylon loop is attached to the bottom for removal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F106838\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef106838 \">picture 3</a>). As of 2018, the Today Sponge is the main contraceptive sponge in production and is available in only one size and material.

Once wet, the sponge is gently squeezed to distribute the water throughout and activate the spermicide. To insert the sponge, the woman folds the sides inward toward the dimple (ie, away from the string) and then inserts the device as far back into her vagina as she can reach, with the dimpled side facing towards the cervix. The sponge unfolds in the vagina and its position is checked by having the woman feel around the edge of the sponge with her finger to ensure that it is covering her cervix.</p><p>The sponge, once moistened and inserted, can be used for contraception without delay. It can be inserted up to 24 hours ahead of sex but should not be worn for more than 30 hours in a row (up to 24 hours of use plus 6 hours after final sex act). The woman can have intercourse multiple times during the first 24 hours that the sponge is in place. Once removed, the sponge is discarded (it should not be flushed). It is not reusable.</p><p>The sponge does not require fitting or a prescription. It is available in pharmacies and online. The sponge can be safely used with water-based lubricants if needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4088791826\"><span class=\"h2\">Relative contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who are allergic or sensitive to sulfa, polyurethane, or the spermicide N-9 should not use the contraceptive sponge. Women at risk for HIV should also not use this method. Additional contraindications are similar to those for the diaphragm or spermicide. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Side effects and complications of diaphragm use'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1612161263\" class=\"local\">'Relative contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4028733451\"><span class=\"h2\">Side effects and complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sponge side effects include vaginal irritation or dryness.
