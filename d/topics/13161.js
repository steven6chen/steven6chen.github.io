It may result in an acute arthritis and a chronic arthropathy (tophaceous gout).</p><p>Hyperuricemia (urate concentration exceeding the solubility of urate in extracellular fluid) is a common and necessary pathogenetic factor in the development of gout, but it is insufficient to explain clinical expression of either self-limited attacks of acute gouty arthritis or chronic gouty arthropathy. These clinical manifestations also require MSU crystal formation and deposition in tissues and acute <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chronic inflammatory responses to the presence of such crystals.</p><p>The pathophysiologic mechanisms of MSU crystal deposition, acute crystal-induced inflammation, and chronic destructive lesions of joints and bones associated with collections of MSU crystals (tophi) will be reviewed here.

Individual differences in the formation of crystals <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> in inflammatory responses to those crystals may play a role in whether a person with hyperuricemia will develop the disease. Multiple risk factors are associated with the development of hyperuricemia, which can be caused by absolute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] or relative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] impairment of renal uric acid excretion, overproduction of uric acid, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> overconsumption of purine-rich foods that are metabolized to urate. The causes of hyperuricemia and the normal mechanisms of urate handling are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=asymptomatic-hyperuricemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Asymptomatic hyperuricemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urate-balance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urate balance&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A causative relationship among hyperuricemia, deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals, and gout was proposed by Garrod in the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Freudweiler established in 1899 that injection of tophaceous material caused inflammation, further supporting the validity of the concept of gout as MSU crystal deposition disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. MSU crystals were identified in synovial fluid from patients with acute gouty arthritis using compensated polarized microscopy in 1961 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], which was followed soon after by the observation that injection of MSU crystals into normal joints produced acute gout attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Risk factors associated with the development of gout appear to mediate their effects, at least in part, through promoting saturation of extracellular fluid urate levels, an aberrant biochemical state confirmed by measurement of serum or plasma urate. Both non-modifiable and modifiable risk factors have been recognized. Non-modifiable risk factors include male gender, advanced age, and ethnicity (eg, Pacific Islanders). Associations of at least 28 genetic loci with hyperuricemia have been established by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]; single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analyses at these loci have identified polymorphic alleles that also alter gout risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Modifiable risk factors include obesity, diets rich in meat and seafood content, alcohol-containing beverages (especially beer and distilled spirits), sodas and fruit juices high in fructose or sucrose content, hypertension, thiazide or loop diuretic use, chronic kidney disease, postmenopausal and organ transplant recipient status, and use of certain medications (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> A or low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, although cardioprotective aspirin doses of only 81 to 325 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> do not warrant discontinuation). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urate-balance#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urate balance&quot;, section on 'Hyperuricemia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=asymptomatic-hyperuricemia#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Asymptomatic hyperuricemia&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-urate-lowering-therapy-and-treatment-of-tophi-in-patients-with-gout#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic urate-lowering therapy and treatment of tophi in patients with gout&quot;, section on 'Risk reduction'</a>.)</p><p>Lead toxicity has been associated with gout since the 1700s, but the mechanism has been a matter of debate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Some evidence has suggested that blood lead levels widely considered to be within an acceptable range may be associated with an increased prevalence of gout [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. These findings need confirmation, and it is unknown whether interventions to lower lead levels will reduce risk.</p><p>The importance of an increased capacity for crystal formation in patients with gout, although unexplained, is supported by the observation that MSU crystals are frequently found in synovial fluid from uninflamed joints of gout patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], but are found less commonly in synovial fluids from non-gouty hyperuricemic individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. It is not known whether the presence of crystals in the latter case indicates a greater risk for later development of clinical gout [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Higher levels of uric acid in the blood are clearly associated with a greater risk for developing gout [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>], but not necessarily more severe gout. Obesity and ethanol ingestion further increase the risk for gout at any given level of hyperuricemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Among people with an established history of gout, consumption of alcohol or intermittent use of diuretics, which may result in abrupt changes in extracellular fluid urate levels, appear to acutely increase the risk of an attack [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>Several clinical features of gout remain incompletely understood, but may relate in part to the concentration of uric acid and the solubility of MSU; these features include the predilection of gout for the first metatarsal phalangeal (MTP) joint; the precipitation of acute attacks by trauma, surgery, or the initiation of urate-lowering therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>]; and the spontaneous resolution of attacks (see <a href=\"#H512727\" class=\"local\">'Resolution of acute MSU crystal-induced inflammation'</a> below). Plausible though unproven explanations for the frequent involvement of the first MTP include relative coolness of the feet (reducing the solubility of MSU); the repeated microtrauma to which the MTP joint is subjected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], possibly altering components of the tissue matrix; and differential reabsorption into the joint of exuded solvent (joint fluid) and solute (urate) from the periarticular area when weightbearing is replaced by recumbency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CRYSTALS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The solubility of monosodium urate (MSU), which is reduced by lower temperatures, is determined by its concentration together with factors that influence nucleation and growth of crystals. These elements explain, at least in part, why hyperuricemia is necessary but not sufficient for the development of gout and the increased risk of gout that is associated with increasing urate concentration.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Urate concentration</strong> &ndash; The solubility of MSU in physiologic saline at 37&ordm;C, about 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (416 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L),</span> is approximately the same concentration above which patients are at risk of developing gout [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Measurements of MSU solubility in plasma and serum have varied more widely than those in saline, although the average value is similar.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Temperature</strong> &ndash; The solubility of MSU falls rapidly with decreasing temperature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Noninflamed synovial fluid is significantly cooler than serum, being 90 to 91&ordm;F (32&ordm;C) in the knee [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], so the upper limit of urate solubility in tissue of a given joint could be considerably less than 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (416 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nucleation and growth</strong> &ndash; Both nucleation rates and subsequent growth rates of MSU crystals are directly proportional to the degree of MSU supersaturation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Solubility is a thermodynamic parameter determined when a fluid is in equilibrium with a solid phase. Supersaturation may persist if nucleation and growth of MSU crystals do not occur. Indeed, urate has been noted to remain in solution indefinitely at a concentration of 84 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Data are conflicting on whether particular components of cartilage or joint fluid promote or inhibit the critical nucleation step [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/31-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">INFLAMMATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H511996\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute inflammation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple cellular- and fluid phase-based mechanisms of innate immune activation by monosodium urate (MSU) crystals are recognized as critical to the development of the signs and symptoms of acute gout [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. Inflammatory responses to crystal deposition and release, and the phagocytosis of MSU crystals by neutrophils and a variety of other cells all contribute to the inflammatory response.</p><p/><p>An intense inflammatory response initiated in the synovium by MSU crystal deposition, or more often by release of MSU crystals from preformed deposits, is characteristic of acute gouty arthritis. Synovial lining cell hyperplasia and infiltration by neutrophils, <span class=\"nowrap\">monocytes/macrophages,</span> and lymphocytes are major histologic features of this process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The predominance of neutrophils and neutrophil phagocytosis of MSU crystals in the synovial fluid aspirated from an acute gouty joint, which is the accepted hallmark for definitive diagnosis of acute gout [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], focused attention on inflammatory processes mediated by neutrophils in the pathogenesis of acute gout. This view was also supported by suppression of acute MSU crystal-induced inflammation in experimental animals rendered neutropenic prior to MSU crystal joint injection and restoration of the inflammatory response to injection after neutrophil repletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>The identification of multiple additional events that precede or accompany neutrophil activation has contributed to further understanding of the complex processes involved in initiation and amplification of MSU crystal-induced inflammation. As an example, synovial cells, monocytes, and endothelial cells all phagocytose MSU crystals and release proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine mediators, and phagocytosis of MSU crystals by synovial lining cells, some of which have the phenotypic characteristics of macrophages, precedes the influx of neutrophils into the joint in vivo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/40-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-43</a>].</p><p>Study of MSU crystal-induced inflammation has further intensified since the early 2000s and revealed the importance of processes activating the innate immune system that are shared with rare inherited disorders, such as the cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cryopyrin-associated-periodic-syndromes-and-related-disorders#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes and related disorders&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>). Some studies have shown that MSU crystals derived from urate released from cells undergoing &ldquo;sterile&rdquo; cell death can also serve as a danger signal, activating both innate and adaptive immune responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/36,45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,45-47</a>]. Understanding the primacy and interactions of pro- (and anti-) inflammatory processes induced by MSU crystals and how environmental factors, including comorbidities, affect (and are affected by) these processes remains a work in progress. Still, considerable insight has been gained in identifying mediators of the sequential events in acute gouty inflammation: initiation, amplification, and resolution.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H512021\"><span class=\"h3\">Initiation of acute MSU crystal-induced inflammation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initiation of the acute inflammatory response to MSU crystals is affected by properties of the crystals themselves and proteins coating the crystals, cell-mediated mechanisms including signalling via membrane receptors, assembly and activation of the inflammasome, and the release of multiple cytokines.</p><p>Certain properties of MSU crystals, including size, electrostatic charge, state of aggregation, and the presence and nature of proteins coating the crystals, may impart or restrain the proinflammatory potential of MSU crystals deposited in the joint. For example, MSU crystals derived from tophi produce more inflammation than synthetic crystals, a difference that is eliminated by protease treatment of tophi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Binding of immunoglobulin G (IgG) to MSU crystals results in an increased release of superoxide and lysosomal enzymes from human neutrophils in vitro compared with protein-free, crystal-induced release of these substances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-51</a>]. Although these findings imply an amplification rather than initiation phase effect for crystal-IgG binding, reduction in the inflammation potential of MSU crystals bound by lipoproteins (particularly those containing apolipoprotein B [ApoB]) prior to injection in animal models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>] suggests that lipoprotein binding to crystals contributes to the resolution of acute gout (see <a href=\"#H512727\" class=\"local\">'Resolution of acute MSU crystal-induced inflammation'</a> below) and, perhaps, to the absence of MSU crystal-induced attacks in the joints of gout patients in whom MSU crystals without evidence of inflammation persist over the course of many months or years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>MSU crystal cell-mediated interactions supporting or essential for the initiation phase of MSU crystal-induced acute inflammation include membrane signaling through Toll-like receptors (TLR)-2 and TLR-4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]; and expression of MyD88 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]; and expression of MyD88 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>], an adaptor protein (CD14) shared by TLR-2 and TLR-4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>], and TREM 1 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Conflicting data have been presented regarding the necessity of one or more of these mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/54,56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,56-58</a>], although a central role for resident macrophages in the initiation of acute MSU crystal inflammation is widely acknowledged.</p><p>Monocytes and synoviocytes release interleukin (IL)-1, Il-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in response to MSU crystals in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/40,59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,59-61</a>], and increased levels of IL-6, IL-8, and TNF are found in gouty tissues in vivo. A major advance has been identification of the assembly and activation of the NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, with consequent caspase-1-catalyzed pro-IL-1 processing and release of IL-1 beta from macrophages and activated monocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. This work has clarified the sequence of molecular events related to initiation and amplification of MSU crystal-induced inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>]. Recruitment and activation of neutrophils, monocytes, dendritic cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], and other inflammatory cells appear to be dependent upon locally produced cytokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/64-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-66</a>], and IL-1 beta is a cytokine critical for initiation of gouty inflammation. Rodents deficient in IL-1 receptors do not mount as vigorous an inflammatory response as wild-type animals do to injected MSU crystals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>], and clinical trials showing the efficacy of IL-1 antagonists in treatment <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prophylaxis of acute gout flares support a role for IL-1 mediation in acute gout [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/24,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,67</a>].</p><p>An additional mechanism potentially germane to the clinically observed enhanced frequency of acute inflammatory response to MSU crystals by increasing soluble urate, nutritional stressors, alcohol excess, and specific comorbidities (such as obesity and metabolic syndrome) is suggested by in vitro and in vivo studies in mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. These studies examined regulation of the activity of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a metabolic biosensor with anti-inflammatory properties. Suppression and activation of AMPK alpha1 phosphorylation respectively enhanced or suppressed MSU crystal-induced IL-1 beta and CXCL1 release. Enhanced phosphorylation also promoted the macrophage antiinflammatory (M2) phenotype and inhibited NLRP3 gene expression and activation of caspase-1 and IL-1 beta. In addition, exposure of bone marrow-derived macrophages to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a>, at concentrations (10 micromolar) achievable in humans during gout flare prophylaxis, was associated with each of the above antiinflammatory responses. Prior research has established that hyperuricemia, alcohol consumption, nutritional stressors, obesity, and metabolic syndrome decrease tissue AMPK activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/69-73\" class=\"abstract_t\">69-73</a>]. Thus, the experimental results described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>] are consistent with the view that AMPK activity limits MSU crystal-induced inflammation and mediates at least some of the antiinflammatory effects of colchicine in macrophages.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H512713\"><span class=\"h3\">Amplification of acute MSU crystal-induced inflammation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neutrophils provide a central cellular mechanism for amplification of acute gouty inflammation, a role accurately reflected both by the synovial histology and the leukocyte profile of synovial fluid aspirated at clinical presentation of the human gout flare. Neutrophil recruitment to the joint requires cellular and fluid phase proinflammatory processes, such as mast cell degranulation, activation of the complement cascade, and expression of endothelium-derived selectins, which play their major roles in the neutrophil-centered amplification of inflammation.</p><p>Activation of the endothelium of blood vessels adjacent to the joint is mediated by MSU crystal-induced participation of activated resident macrophages, chondrocytes, mast cells, and dendritic cells, and by activation of both classical and alternative complement pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/37,74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,74,75</a>]. Endothelial cell activation results in vascular dilatation and increased vascular permeability; the activation of endothelial cells also results in the elaboration of adhesion molecules, including E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM), and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM) on the endothelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. As a consequence, neutrophils in the circulation undergo tethering, rolling, and adhesion to the endothelium, leading to their traversal of the vessel wall. Subsequently, extravasated cells follow the concentration gradients of chemotactic molecules to the site of inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,76</a>]. The major chemotactic molecule involved in crystal-induced inflammation is IL-8, with leukotriene B4, IL-1, and complement fragment C5a also contributing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/75,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,77</a>].</p><p>A study utilizing human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and murine macrophages found that free fatty acid engagement of TLR-2 on human PBMCs resulted in a synergistic increase in MSU crystal-induced IL-1 beta release that was dependent upon activation of components of the NLRP3 inflammasome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Interestingly, synergy between MSU crystals and TLR-2 ligands in IL-1 and IL-6 release is greater in PBMCs derived from gouty than from non-gouty persons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>], suggesting a possible basis for the clinical observation that constitutional events such as dietary indiscretions provoke acute gout attacks.</p><p>Neutrophils are involved in a positive feedback loop of inflammation. Once in the inflamed joint, some neutrophils are subject to either crystal phagocytosis-induced degranulation or direct crystal lysis of lysosomal or cell membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], with the release of further inflammatory mediators (prostaglandin E2, nitric oxide, leukotriene B4 [LTB-4], reactive oxygen species, S100A8, S100A9, IL-1 , and IL-8), as well as mediators of pain and tissue damage. Since most neutrophils in synovial fluid in acute gout do not contain detectable crystals, it seems likely that such cells may contribute to gouty inflammation in ways that do not require crystal phagocytosis, such as by downregulation of negative regulators of neutrophil activation like myeloid inhibitory C-type lectin-like receptor (MICL), which results in IL-1-independent increases in IL-8 production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Neutrophils activated by MSU crystals also recruit and activate <span class=\"nowrap\">monocytes/macrophages</span> to express proinflammatory molecules, including IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], and LTB-4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].</p><p>MSU crystal activation of fluid phase <span class=\"nowrap\">inflammatory/nociception</span> mediator systems includes the classical and alternative complement pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/75,77,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,77,82</a>]; formation of the complement membrane attack complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>], which activates endothelial cells to produce the potent neutrophil chemotaxin, IL-8 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]; the kallikrein-kininogen pathway (the product, bradykinin, contributing to vascular endothelial cell activation); prostaglandins; and substance P and LTB4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>], which are nociceptor sensitizers that result in the heightened pain associated with acute gout. The cellular biology and intracellular signaling mechanisms involved in neutrophil chemotaxis and activation in response to crystals are complex, involving transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally determined changes in the actions of kinases, phospholipases, chemoattractants, adhesion molecules, and other factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H512727\"><span class=\"h3\">Resolution of acute MSU crystal-induced inflammation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanisms by which a typical attack of acute gout resolves even without treatment within a few days to several weeks are uncertain, but serial analysis of synovial fluid during an acute attack has shown the emergence of increased levels of some negative regulators of inflammation in the course of attack resolution; changes in the physical properties of the crystals may also play a role.</p><p>In the synovial fluid, negative regulatory factors include antiinflammatory cytokines, transforming growth factor (TGF) beta-1, IL-1 receptor antagonist, IL-10, and soluble TNF <span class=\"nowrap\">receptor-I/II</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/83,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,84</a>]; in synovial fluid cells, levels of cytokine-inducible SH2 (src homology 2 domain)-containing protein (CIS), and suppressors of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) are upregulated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. Other mechanisms implicated in suppressing crystal-induced inflammation include inactivation of inflammatory mediators, deactivation or altered maturation of inflammatory cells, phagocytic disposal of apoptotic neutrophils, and enhanced expression of melanocortin 3 receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>] and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>].</p><p>Dissolution of urate crystals by products of phagocytes, including superoxide, or sequestration of crystals in the synovium could serve to turn off inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>], but resolution of an acute attack of gout appears to occur even in the ongoing presence of intracellular crystals. However, the physical properties of crystals may change with inflammation. Indeed, neutrophil-derived products remove IgG from MSU crystals, thereby making them less inflammatory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. Perhaps of greater importance is the observation that increasing amounts of antiinflammatory ApoB bind to MSU crystals over the course of an attack [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H512766\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic inflammation: tophaceous gout and gouty arthroprathy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">The tophus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tophi are deposits of MSU crystals surrounded by granulomatous inflammation; the tophus is a complex but organized and dynamic chronic inflammatory tissue response to MSU crystal deposition. Both innate immunity and adaptive immunity participate. The correlated expression of both pro- and antiinflammatory factors in these lesions suggests cyclic processes of tophus inflammation and resolution and of tissue remodeling.</p><p>Tophi are most often found in proteoglycan-rich articular, periarticular, and subcutaneous areas, including joints, bone, cartilage, tendons, and skin. Uncommonly, tophi may be found in parenchymal organs as well. The tissue reaction to a tophus is generally chronic inflammatory in type and involves both innate and adaptive immunity. Although clinical signs of acute inflammation sometimes occur in tophi, this is unusual.</p><p>Tophi surgically obtained from 12 established gout patients were analyzed by quantitative immunohistochemistry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. The coronal zone of the tophus (immediately surrounding a mass of MSU crystals and, in turn, surrounded by a fibrovascular zone) contains substantial numbers of CD68+ mononuclear macrophages, and lesser numbers of multinucleated CD68+ cells and plasma cells. Few neutrophils are present. CD20+ B cells are present in small numbers in the fibrovascular zone, and both mast cells and T cells are found in modest numbers in both coronal and fibrovascular zones. Of note, IL-1 beta is frequently expressed by CD68+ cells in the corona, and the number of mononuclear cells expressing the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1 beta correlates with the number expressing the antiinflammatory cytokine TGF beta-1.</p><p>Visible or palpable tophi are usually noted among patients who have had repeated attacks of acute gouty arthritis, often over many years. Tophi and ensuing tophaceous joint damage (gouty arthropathy) may develop, however, in joints which have never been the sites of an acute gout flare. In addition, microscopic examination of synovium from patients with acute gout who do not have clinically detectable tophi can show micro-tophi containing only a thin rim of fibrocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. Although unsubstantiated, the initiation of an acute gout attack may begin with the release of MSU crystals from micro-tophi into the synovial fluid or may actually begin in the tissue. The latter mechanism is consistent with the clinical observation that joint fluid obtained shortly after the onset of symptoms is sometimes free of crystals, while a repeat aspiration a day or more later is floridly positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. It is tempting to ascribe posttraumatic acute gout to this mechanism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H512773\"><span class=\"h3\">Chronic gouty arthropathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The histological and immunohistochemical study of the damaging effects of MSU crystal deposits have been substantially aided by the advent of newer imaging modalities (such as ultrasonography, dual-energy computed tomography [DECT], and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), which have highlighted the close relationship between MSU crystal deposits and the development of bone and cartilage erosions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. Tophi contribute to bone erosion and joint damage in gout [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>], and a role for activated osteoclasts in gouty bone erosion is suggested by the observation that MSU crystal deposits are surrounded by osteoclast-like cells at the interface of a tophus and bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. MSU crystals do not directly stimulate osteoclast formation, but may activate osteoclastogenesis by altering the ratio of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) to osteoprotegerin (OPG) in stromal cells such as osteoblasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/95,96\" class=\"abstract_t\">95,96</a>].</p><p>In addition, T cells expressing RANKL are present in the tophus, providing an alternative mechanism for disordered osteoclastogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. MSU crystals also compromise the viability, function, and differentiation of osteoblasts in primary culture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/98,99\" class=\"abstract_t\">98,99</a>], and osteoblasts are scarce at the tophus-bone interface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. These effects may reflect crystal activation of osteoblast phagocytosis and NLRP3-dependent autophagy, with associated functional dedifferentiation in these cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. The expression of matrix metalloproteinases in response to MSU crystals in tophi may also contribute to cartilage and bone matrix damage in tophaceous gout [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/100,101\" class=\"abstract_t\">100,101</a>].</p><p>MSU crystals also provoke negative effects on chondrocyte and cartilage viability and function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/93,102\" class=\"abstract_t\">93,102</a>]. Human chondrocytes, isolated or in cartilage explants, undergo increasing cell death in response to exposure to increasing doses of MSU-crystals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>], and chondrocyte production of cartilage matrix is also impaired by culture in the presence of crystals, as assessed by collagen, aggrecan, and versican gene expression. Examination of joints with extensive tophaceous deposits can show no intact hyaline cartilage, with only residual fragments of degenerate cartilage surrounded by tophaceous material [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. Finally, chondrocyte exposure to MSU crystals appears to upregulate the inflammatory milieu associated with tophi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-gout/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H244423514\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperuricemia can be caused by absolute or relative impairment of renal urate excretion, overproduction of uric acid, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> overconsumption of purine-rich foods that are metabolized to urate. In some affected individuals, a period of hyperuricemia leads to monosodium urate (MSU) crystal deposition, reaction to which can result in the acute <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chronic inflammation associated with the signs and symptoms of gout. Hyperuricemia is a necessary predisposing factor for gout, but the majority of hyperuricemic patients never develop gout. Individual differences in the formation of crystals <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> in inflammatory responses to those crystals may play a role in whether a person with hyperuricemia will develop gout.

Obesity and ethanol ingestion further increase the risk for gout at any given level of hyperuricemia. Among persons with an established history of gout, consumption of alcohol or intermittent use of diuretics, which may result in abrupt changes in extracellular fluid urate levels, appear to acutely increase the risk of an attack.

The solubility of MSU falls rapidly with decreasing temperature. It is unclear whether particular components of cartilage and joint fluid promote or inhibit crystal nucleation.

Release of IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and additional proinflammatory molecules also supports MSU crystal-induced inflammation.
