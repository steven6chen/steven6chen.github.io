This is because the radiation dose decreases by the square of the distance from the source (eg, doubling the distance decreases the exposure by a factor of four), a relationship known as the inverse square law. The protective effect of shielding in radiation accidents is limited. This is because radiation accidents usually involve high-energy gamma radiation and the amount of shielding that would be necessary for adequate protection is not practical [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-radiation-exposure-in-children-following-a-nuclear-disaster/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Respiratory protection for medical providers with an N-95 mask is recommended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Communities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As described above, maximizing the distance from the exposure source is the most effective protective strategy. Thus, if at all possible after radiation release from a nuclear disaster, evacuation of the area of exposure should be undertaken [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-radiation-exposure-in-children-following-a-nuclear-disaster/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Federal, state, and local agencies will determine whether the need for relocation is temporary or long-term depending upon the persistence of radiation, physical damage to roads and buildings, and other factors affecting population safety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-radiation-exposure-in-children-following-a-nuclear-disaster/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Shielding, or sheltering, is a reasonable alternative if evacuation is not possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-radiation-exposure-in-children-following-a-nuclear-disaster/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A safe place should be sought within the home or other building. The shielding factor (the ratio of the dose of radiation received within a structure to that if the structure were not present) varies depending upon the type of structure, and the location within the structure. As an example, the shielding factor for gamma radiation after a radioactive cloud release in various locations is as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-radiation-exposure-in-children-following-a-nuclear-disaster/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wooden frame structure &ndash; 0.9</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Home basement &ndash; 0.6</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Home basement in a masonry home &ndash; 0.4</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large office or industrial building &ndash; 0.2</p><p/><p>The need for evacuation or sheltering may arise while children are at school or day care. Families and school or child care facilities should make a plan for reunification in the event that a radiation accident occurs during these times. The duration of sheltering that is necessary depends upon the extent of environmental contamination from the nuclear disaster [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-radiation-exposure-in-children-following-a-nuclear-disaster/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Families should follow the instructions provided by the emergency broadcast system.</p><p>In addition, in December 2001, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) offered to provide two potassium iodide tablets (the mainstay of preventive treatment after known or suspected exposure to radioactive iodine) to every person living within 10 miles of a nuclear power plant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-radiation-exposure-in-children-following-a-nuclear-disaster/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Rapid administration of this drug, in the event of exposure to radioactive iodine, requires that supplies are pre-deployed at homes, schools, and day care centers that are located within the 10-mile radius.</p><p>Information on dose and available preparations (including instructions on how to mix the tablets with food or drink to make them palatable for infants and small children) can be found at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/EmergencyPreparedness/BioterrorismandDrugPreparedness/ucm072248.htm&amp;token=E/6ENHjwT3VwbJONSOIZzBkAcYVlczQvsOb/QndrCSq31Egp9Vhq/UVmpsmhCnGy92Rpghxegtc+mxkoTMpcrIVFFfc3jkv1RTEK8PRusJEhYxwEgrfi4Gb91n53+EhH&amp;TOPIC_ID=6588\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">website</a>.

To be able to handle such an emergency effectively, major referral hospitals and hospitals that function as the designated receiving center for victims of radiation accidents should rehearse the protocol until it is familiar to all staff members who may need to participate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-radiation-exposure-in-children-following-a-nuclear-disaster/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Rehearsal of and familiarity with the protocols help to expedite care, to prevent contamination, and to educate medical staff about the biologic risks of radiation and radiation safety. All emergency departments should have ready access to the supplies and equipment necessary in the management of radiation accidents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71406\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71406 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment area</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If possible, contaminated patients should enter the treatment facility through a separate entrance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-radiation-exposure-in-children-following-a-nuclear-disaster/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The entryway should be covered with paper or waterproof sheets that are taped to the ground or floor. If a separate entrance is not available, the contaminated patient can be placed on a clean stretcher outside the emergency department and wrapped in a cloth sheet before transport to the desired area of the hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-radiation-exposure-in-children-following-a-nuclear-disaster/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-of-radiation-exposure-in-children#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features of radiation exposure in children&quot;, section on 'Contamination'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, the areas traversed by contaminated patients should be taped off and labeled as radioactive. A buffer zone between the contaminated and uncontaminated areas helps to prevent the spread of radioactive material. Designated personnel should remain in this area to transfer material from &quot;clean&quot; to &quot;dirty&quot; by taking uncontaminated material from the clean side and directly handing it to personnel in the contaminated area without individual-to-individual contact. If at all possible, a radiation safety specialist should be on hand to monitor levels of radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-radiation-exposure-in-children-following-a-nuclear-disaster/abstract/6,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8,9</a>].</p><p>The decontamination room should be separate from the rest of the treatment areas of the emergency department. Areas, such as autopsy rooms, casting areas, or isolated areas of the emergency department, can be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-radiation-exposure-in-children-following-a-nuclear-disaster/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The ventilation system of the decontamination room should be separate from that of the remainder of the hospital. If a separate ventilation system is not in place, the ventilation to the room should be turned off to avoid the spread of radioactive particles. Nonessential equipment should be removed from the room. All handles, switches, and essential equipment should be covered with masking tape, paper tape, or other nonpermeable covering that is sealed with tape.</p><p>The decontamination room must be equipped with instruments for monitoring radiation (eg, alpha counters and Geiger-Muller counters). Scrub suits, gowns, gloves, masks, hats, and foot covers should be readily available. After the protective gear is donned by personnel, all openings should be taped closed to create a complete and intact barrier. Plastic bags, waste containers, and lead containers must be available for storage and disposal of contaminated material (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71406\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71406 \">table 1</a>). The decontamination process is discussed in detail below. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Decontamination'</a> below.).</p><p>Real-time dosimeters must be worn by healthcare providers to monitor their total radiation exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-radiation-exposure-in-children-following-a-nuclear-disaster/abstract/6,8-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8-13</a>]. Film badges are not recommended because they do not provide real time measurements. The National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements recommends a maximum of 100 rem (1 Sv) of exposure for providers in lifesaving emergency situations and 25 rem (0.25 Sv) in less urgent situations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-radiation-exposure-in-children-following-a-nuclear-disaster/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Personnel should be rotated to minimize exposure. Pregnant personnel should be excluded from the treating team.</p><p>Once decontamination is complete, all tape and protective coverings should be removed and disposed of in labeled bags, and the area should be rechecked. As they exit the decontamination room, decontamination personnel enter the buffer zone, where they remove their outer protection, turning the garments inside out. They label their dosimeter badges and turn them in to the radiation officer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-radiation-exposure-in-children-following-a-nuclear-disaster/abstract/6,8,9,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8,9,11,12</a>]. When decontamination is complete, the radiation safety inspector performs a final sweep of the entrance, the transferring area, the buffer zone, and the treatment area to ensure that no excessive radiation remains before the treatment team leaves the contamination area.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once notified of a radiation accident, the receiving facility should try to obtain a detailed account of the accident in order to determine the nature of the exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-radiation-exposure-in-children-following-a-nuclear-disaster/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What radioactive substances were involved (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82388\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82388 \">table 2</a>)?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What type of exposure(s) occurred (eg, contamination, incorporation, acute partial body exposure, acute whole-body exposure)?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How many victims were involved?</p><p/><p>A radiation safety officer at the receiving facility should be notified and made responsible for monitoring radiation levels, overseeing the storage and disposal of decontaminated materials, and ensuring that contamination is eliminated. A radiology technician with training in dosimetry can serve in this role if the facility does not have a designated radiation safety officer.</p><p>The Radiation Emergency Assistance Center and Training Site <span class=\"nowrap\">(REAC/TS)</span> at Oak Ridge, Tennessee is a part of the Department of Energy and provides 24-hour medical consultation and assistance (<a href=\"http://orise.orau.gov/reacts/&amp;token=KwI7QU3nQ/EQzsy+/4UGJL2/ClwCUaiMr8VlGVRgQOMqWJMj1hSngQDtciJLtzCM&amp;TOPIC_ID=6588\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://orise.orau.gov/reacts/</a>). The telephone number is 865-576-1005. Consultation with <span class=\"nowrap\">REAC/TS</span> is sometimes necessary before the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will release certain medications for management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-radiation-exposure-in-children-following-a-nuclear-disaster/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The treating facility is not required to notify <span class=\"nowrap\">REAC/TS</span>. However, the facility at which the exposure occurred is required to report all incidents of accidental exposure of nuclear compounds to the Department of Energy.</p><p>The first priority in the management of children who are exposed to radiation is stabilization of life- and limb-threatening conditions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency care of moderate and severe thermal burns in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Immediate therapy for radiation effects is rarely necessary except in individuals who received extremely high (and probably lethal) doses of radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-radiation-exposure-in-children-following-a-nuclear-disaster/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The effects of radiation exposure that require treatment usually manifest after a latency period of days to weeks. After medical stabilization, decontamination is initiated to minimize continued irradiation in individuals who have been contaminated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Triage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Emergency departments that are eligible to receive victims of radiation accidents must be prepared to manage large numbers of victims. In mass casualty situations, the receiving hospital must triage patients according to its capabilities, with priority given to those who are likely to survive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-radiation-exposure-in-children-following-a-nuclear-disaster/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. If resources are limited, it may be necessary to provide palliative care only (eg, pain control, antiemetics, antiepileptics) to victims who are known to have received a lethal dose of gamma radiation.</p><p>Appropriate triage of victims requires accurate estimation of the received dose of radiation. Initial estimates of radiation dose are based upon the timing, severity, and duration of symptoms; these estimates are revised based upon laboratory studies that are performed as soon as is practical.</p><p>As a general rule, patients who demonstrate symptoms within two hours of exposure should be assumed to have received a high and possibly lethal dose of radiation. However, it is important to remember that some symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, may be caused by stress rather than the acute radiation syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-radiation-exposure-in-children-following-a-nuclear-disaster/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The response to antiemetics can be helpful in distinguishing the origin of nausea and vomiting. Antiemetics are usually ineffective in patients who received lethal doses of radiation, whereas they may be helpful in patients who received lower doses. In addition, prodromal nausea and vomiting in patients who are likely to recover may last up to 48 hours (but usually not longer) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-radiation-exposure-in-children-following-a-nuclear-disaster/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The laboratory evaluation of patients exposed to radiation is performed to evaluate the biologic effects of radiation and to prepare for therapies that may be necessary (eg, blood transfusion, bone marrow transplantation, fluid and electrolyte therapy).

Metallic fragments can be highly radioactive and should be removed with tongs or forceps (to increase the distance between the exposure source and the healthcare provider&rsquo;s fingers) rather than the fingers. Wounds should then be copiously irrigated with warmed, normal saline until they are free of radioactivity, and then covered with a waterproof dressing. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Decontamination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To assess the possibility of internal contamination, separate saline- or water-moistened cotton-tipped applicators should be used to swab the skin, nares, ears, mouth, and wounds before and after decontamination.
