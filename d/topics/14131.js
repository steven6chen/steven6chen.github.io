Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is the severe form of PMS. Common symptoms include anger, irritability, depression, and internal tension that are severe enough to interfere with daily activities.</p><p>Mild PMS is common, affecting up to 75 percent of women with regular menstrual cycles; PMDD affects only 3 to 8 percent of women. This condition can affect women of any socioeconomic, cultural, or ethnic background.</p><p>PMDD is usually a chronic condition and can have a serious impact on a woman's quality of life. Fortunately, a variety of treatments and self-care measures can effectively control the symptoms in most women.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PMS AND PMDD CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tissues throughout the body are sensitive to hormone levels that change throughout a woman's menstrual cycle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79496\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79496 \">figure 1</a>). Studies suggest that rising and falling levels of hormones (eg, estrogen and progesterone) may also influence chemicals in the brain, including a substance called serotonin, which affects mood.</p><p>However, it is not clear why some women develop premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and others do not. Levels of estrogen and progesterone are similar in women with and without these conditions. The most likely explanation, based upon several studies, is that women who develop PMDD are highly sensitive to normal changes in hormone levels.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PMS AND PMDD SYMPTOMS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Common symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) are fatigue, bloating, irritability, depression, and anxiety. Other symptoms include the following (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-premenstrual-syndrome-and-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sadness, hopelessness, or feelings of worthlessness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tension, anxiety, or &quot;edginess&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Variable moods with frequent tearfulness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent irritability, anger, and conflict with family, coworkers, or friends</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased interest in usual activities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Difficulty concentrating</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fatigue, lethargy, or lack of energy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in appetite, which may include binge eating or craving certain foods</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive sleeping or difficulty sleeping</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feelings of being overwhelmed or out of control</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breast tenderness or swelling, headaches, joint or muscle pain, weight gain</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Disorders that mimic PMS and PMDD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other conditions have symptoms that are similar to those of PMS and PMDD, including depression, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, and perimenopause (the four- to five-year period before menopause). It is important to distinguish between underlying depression (which often worsens before menses) and true PMS or PMDD because the treatments are quite different.</p><p>Women with underlying depression often feel better during or after menses, but their symptoms do <strong>not</strong> resolve completely. On the other hand, women with PMS or PMDD have a complete resolution of symptoms when their menses begin. Some women who think they have PMS or PMDD actually have depression or an anxiety disorder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=depression-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Depression in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are other medical disorders that worsen before or during menstruation, such as migraines; chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also known as systemic exertion intolerance disease (SEID); pelvic and bladder pain; or irritable bowel syndrome. A careful medical history should be able to distinguish among these disorders. It is also possible for a woman to have PMDD in addition to another medical condition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=headache-causes-and-diagnosis-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Headache causes and diagnosis in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irritable-bowel-syndrome-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Irritable bowel syndrome (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Diagnosis of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PMS AND PMDD DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no single test that can diagnose premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). The symptoms must occur only during the second half (luteal phase) of the menstrual cycle, most often during the five to seven days before the menstrual period, and there must be physical as well as behavioral symptoms. In women with PMS or PMDD, these symptoms should not be present between days 4 through 12 of a 28-day menstrual cycle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood tests are not necessary to diagnose PMS or PMDD. A blood count may be recommended to screen for other medical conditions that cause fatigue, such as anemia. Thyroid function tests can detect hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid gland) or hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid gland), both of which have similar signs and symptoms to PMS and PMDD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypothyroidism-underactive-thyroid-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperthyroidism-overactive-thyroid-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Recording symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although a woman's symptoms may suggest PMDD, a clinician may request that she carefully record her symptoms on a daily basis for two full menstrual cycles</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">PMS AND PMDD TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Conservative treatments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conservative treatments for premenstrual syndrome (PMS) may be recommended first, including regular exercise, relaxation techniques, and vitamin and mineral supplementation. These therapies relieve symptoms in some women and have few or no side effects. If these therapies do not bring sufficient relief, prescription medication can be considered as a second option.</p><p>Conservative treatments are also recommended for women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), along with a prescription medication.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise &ndash; Exercise can help to reduce stress, tension, anxiety, and depression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Exercise (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relaxation&nbsp;therapy &ndash; PMS and PMDD can be worsened by stress, anxiety, depression, and other psychological conditions. Furthermore, living with PMS or PMDD can cause difficulties in interpersonal relationships, at work or school, and with general day-to-day living. Relaxation therapy can help to ease the stress and anxiety of daily life and may include techniques such as meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, self-hypnosis, or biofeedback.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vitamin and mineral supplements &ndash; Vitamin B6 (up to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> might have a small benefit for women with mild PMS. No more than 100 mg of vitamin B6 should be taken per day. The most effective medications are described in the next section.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SSRIs are a highly effective treatment for the symptoms of PMS and PMDD. The SSRIs include fluoxetine (Prozac and Sarafem), sertraline (Zoloft), citalopram (Celexa), and paroxetine (Paxil). Studies showed that SSRIs reduced the symptoms of PMDD significantly compared with placebo; between 60 and 75 percent of women with PMDD improve with an SSRI. It may not be necessary to take the medication every day. Taking the SSRI only during the second half of the menstrual cycle may be sufficient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-premenstrual-syndrome-and-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some women have sexual side effects with SSRIs. The most common sexual side effect is difficulty having an orgasm. If this occurs, using a lower dose or trying an alternative drug in the same drug class is recommended.</p><p>SSRIs should be taken for at least two menstrual cycles to measure their benefit. Approximately 15 percent of women do not experience relief with these drugs after two cycles, in which case an alternative treatment is recommended.</p><p>Other antidepressants that are effective are venlafaxine (Effexor) and escitalopram (Lexapro).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H232259005\"><span class=\"h2\">Birth control pills</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some women with PMS or PMDD get relief from their symptoms when they take a birth control pill. However, some women find that the birth control pill can aggravate their PMS symptoms and, in that case, they should move to an alternative treatment.</p><p>The pill can be taken continuously to avoid having a menstrual period. To do this, the woman takes all of the active pills in a pack and then opens a new pack; the placebo pills are discarded. In theory, taking the pill continuously prevents the usual cyclical hormone changes that could affect mood.</p><p>In the United States, one birth control pill (Yaz) is approved for the treatment of PMDD. Yaz contains 24 tablets of 20 mcg ethinyl estradiol and 3 mg drospirenone. It is thought that mood symptoms are improved with a shorter pill-free interval (number of placebo days). Yaz has only four days, instead of the typical seven days. However, there are some concerns that women who start Yaz might be at higher risk for blood clots in the legs and lungs (but the absolute risk of having a blood clot is very, very low).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists (eg, leuprolide acetate or goserelin acetate) are a type of medication that causes the ovaries to temporarily stop making estrogen and progesterone. This causes a temporary menopause and improves the physical symptoms (eg, bloating) and irritability caused by PMS and PMDD. However, the medication results in extremely low estrogen levels, which causes severe hot flashes and bone loss over time. Therefore, in addition to the GnRH agonist, women are treated with low doses of estrogen and progesterone to stop hot flashes and to prevent bone loss. Although this treatment is very effective, it is complicated and expensive and is only used if other treatments do not work.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Ineffective treatments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several treatments are of no proven benefit in relieving the symptoms of PMS. These treatments include progesterone, other antidepressant drugs (tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors), and lithium. There is also no proven benefit of several popular dietary supplements, including evening primrose oil, essential free fatty acids, and ginkgo biloba.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) causes symptoms one to two weeks before a woman's menstrual period.

PMDD can cause a woman to feel very sad or nervous, to have trouble with friends or family (eg, disagreements with husband or children), and can cause difficulty paying attention to work or school.
