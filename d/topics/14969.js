Children sometimes put small toys, objects, or food in their ears. Bugs can also crawl into the ear and get stuck.</p><p>The part of the ear where things can get stuck is called the &quot;ear canal.&quot; This is the tube that leads from the outside of the ear to the eardrum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F55121\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55121 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13207689\"><span class=\"h1\">Does an object stuck in the ear cause symptoms?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sometimes. Some children who have an object stuck in their ear have no symptoms. Other children have symptoms such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain inside the ear</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood or fluid leaking from the ear</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble hearing</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13207704\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I remove an object stuck in my child's ear on my own?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. Do not try to grab or pull out an object that is stuck in your child's ear. If you do, you might push the object deeper into the ear canal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13207719\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do to help my child on my own?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You can try to make the object fall out by itself. Have your child tilt his or her head so that the ear with the object in it is facing the ground. Then gently pull on your child's outer ear. This sometimes loosens the object so it falls out.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13207734\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I call my child's doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Call the doctor or nurse right away.</p><p>If the object doesn't fall out on its own, the doctor or nurse will need to remove it. Depending on the object and other factors, the doctor or nurse might be able to remove the object in the office. If not, he or she will have you go to the emergency room or to an ear, nose, and throat doctor to have it removed. Batteries (such as button or disc batteries) in the ear are an emergency and need to be removed right away. That's because the electric current from the battery can damage the inside of the ear.</p><p>Even if the object falls out of the ear by itself, your child will still need to see the doctor or nurse. He or she will do an exam and check that no other objects are in your child's ears or nose. (Children sometimes put objects in their nose, too.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13207749\"><span class=\"h1\">How will the doctor or nurse remove the object?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>First, the doctor or nurse will use a special light to look inside the ear to see the object. Depending on the object and where it is, he or she can remove it either by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Squirting water into your child's ear to flush the object out</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using a tool to remove the object</p><p/><p>If a bug is stuck in your child's ear and the bug is alive, the doctor will kill the bug before removing it. He or she can kill the bug by putting medicine or fluid in the ear.</p><p>Before the doctor removes an object from your child's ear, he or she might give your child medicine to make him or her relaxed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13207764\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my child need any other treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. An object stuck in the ear sometimes hurts the skin in the ear canal or causes an infection of the ear canal (called an outer ear infection). If these things happen, the doctor will probably prescribe ear drops that go in your child's ear.</p><p>If your child has an outer ear infection, he or she should keep the inside of the ear dry while the infection heals. Your child should not swim for 7 to 10 days after starting treatment. But he or she can take a shower. To keep the ear dry during a shower, put some petroleum jelly (Vaseline) on a cotton ball, and then put the cotton ball in your child's ear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13207779\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=removing-objects-stuck-up-the-nose-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Removing objects stuck up the nose (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=outer-ear-infection-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Outer ear infection (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ruptured-eardrum-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Ruptured eardrum (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=external-otitis-including-swimmers-ear-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: External otitis (including swimmer's ear) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
