Drug selection could potentially include at least 25 antiretroviral medications available in six major classes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F60927\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60927 \">table 1</a>). However, only a small proportion of these agents are recommended. For most individuals, an ART regimen consists of a dual nucleoside combination plus a third agent from a different class.</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of the different antiretroviral agents used to treat HIV.

The identification and understanding of these processes have provided the basis for antiretroviral drug discovery.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Entry</strong> &ndash; The process of entry involves the binding of HIV to receptors on the surface of the CD4 cell. Once initial binding occurs, the intimate association of HIV with the cell is enhanced by further binding to chemokine coreceptors, which promotes membrane fusion and internalization of the viral genetic material and enzymes necessary for replication. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maraviroc-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Maraviroc</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enfuvirtide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enfuvirtide</a> are antiretroviral agents that inhibit binding and fusion, respectively. However, these agents are not commonly used for the treatment of HIV infection. (See <a href=\"#H1322356540\" class=\"local\">'Entry inhibitors'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Reverse transcription</strong> &ndash; The genetic material of HIV is RNA, and the virus uses reverse transcriptase (one of three virally-encoded enzymes: reverse transcriptase, integrase, and protease) to convert its RNA into DNA. Following reverse transcription, the double-stranded viral DNA product migrates into the nucleus of the cell. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) inhibit the process of reverse transcription. There are several agents in each of these classes that are widely used for the treatment of HIV. (See <a href=\"#H1589706004\" class=\"local\">'Nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs)'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1322357618\" class=\"local\">'Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Integration &ndash;</strong> The virus uses the enzyme integrase to integrate (insert) its viral DNA into the DNA of the host CD4 cell. Once viral DNA has been integrated into the cell's DNA, the cell is infected for the remainder of its life. Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) inhibit the process of integration. In many countries, INSTIs are considered the preferred third agent (in combination with two nucleoside analogues) for treatment-na&iuml;ve individuals. (See <a href=\"#H1322359788\" class=\"local\">'Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs)'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Replication </strong>&ndash; After integration, HIV preferentially replicates in activated cells. Proviral DNA is formed by transcription using the machinery of the host CD4 cell to create new viral RNA. This viral RNA is translated into long polyprotein chains, which will become the protein and enzyme components of new viral particles. There are no antiretroviral agents that inhibit this step of the replication cycle. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Assembly</strong> &ndash; The new viral proteins and enzymes move to the cell's outer membrane where they assemble into an immature, noninfectious HIV particle or bud. There are no antiretroviral agents that inhibit this step of the replication cycle. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Budding and maturation</strong> &ndash; The virus bud is released from the host CD4 cell. The viral enzyme, protease, cuts the long HIV polyprotein chains into smaller functional HIV proteins to make a mature, infectious viral particle. Protease inhibitors are antiretroviral agents that inhibit the HIV protease enzyme, and therefore, prevent this final step in the replication cycle. (See <a href=\"#H1322359219\" class=\"local\">'Protease inhibitors (PIs)'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1322356540\"><span class=\"h1\">ENTRY INHIBITORS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1322356567\"><span class=\"h2\">CCR5-antagonists</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HIV enters CD4 cells via the CD4 receptor in conjunction with one of its coreceptors: the chemokine coreceptor 5 (CCR5) or the CXC chemokine coreceptor 4 (CXCR4). Viruses that use the CCR5 coreceptor are called &quot;R5 viruses,&quot; whereas others that use the CXCR4 coreceptor are called &quot;X4 viruses.&quot;</p><p>Agents that block CCR5 exert their antiviral activity against HIV by blocking entry of CCR5-tropic viruses into the CD4 T cell. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maraviroc-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Maraviroc</a> is the only approved CCR5-antagonist. If maraviroc is being considered, a tropism assay is essential prior to initiation of therapy. This assay determines whether a response from a CCR5 antagonist should be expected since maraviroc is not active against X4 or dual-mixed tropic viruses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hiv-drug-resistance-testing-assays#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of HIV drug resistance testing assays&quot;, section on 'Tropism assays'</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=maraviroc-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Maraviroc</a> is not commonly used for initial treatment of HIV.

This is an injectable agent that is effective in treatment-experienced patients who have not been exposed to this medication. However, enfuvirtide is difficult to administer for long periods of time due to the need for twice-daily injections, which often lead to local cutaneous reactions.

However, lamivudine and emtricitabine should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment of HBV given the high risk of developing HBV resistance with prolonged use. In addition, HBV flares can be seen if agents active against HBV are discontinued. A discussion of the treatment of HBV in HIV-infected patients is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-b-in-the-hiv-infected-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of chronic hepatitis B in the HIV-infected patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Resistance</strong> &ndash; All of the NRTIs can select for resistance mutations.
