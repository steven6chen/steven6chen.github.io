This makes the lung collapse (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F64892\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64892 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Other conditions can also cause a collapsed lung. But this article discusses a collapsed lung caused by air leaking out.</p><p>A pneumothorax can be mild (a small collection of air) or severe (a large collection of air). A severe pneumothorax is a medical emergency and can be life-threatening.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7871935\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes a pneumothorax?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A lung injury, such as from an accident or surgery, can cause a pneumothorax.</p><p>A pneumothorax can also happen in people who do not have a lung injury. Some lung conditions and behaviors make a pneumothorax more likely to happen. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease &ndash; This is a lung condition caused by smoking that makes it hard to breathe. It is also called &quot;emphysema.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain lung infections</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cystic fibrosis &ndash; This is a condition that some children are born with. It causes lung damage and lung infections.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoking</p><p/><p>Sometimes, a pneumothorax happens in people who have no known lung condition or injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7871950\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a pneumothorax?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with a small pneumothorax might not have any symptoms. They might find out that they have it when they have a chest X-ray for another reason.</p><p>When people do have symptoms, the symptoms usually start suddenly and include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain that can be sharp or stabbing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7871965\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I call the doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The symptoms listed above can also be caused by other conditions. But if you have these symptoms, call your doctor or nurse right away.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7871980\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for a pneumothorax?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms, do an exam, and do a chest X-ray.</p><p>He or she might also do a CT scan. A CT scan is an imaging test that can create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7871995\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a pneumothorax treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your treatment will depend on your symptoms and how small or big your pneumothorax is.</p><p>If your pneumothorax is small, your doctor might treat you by giving you oxygen and following your condition. That's because a small pneumothorax sometimes gets better on its own. To follow your condition, your doctor might do a few chest X-rays over time.</p><p>If your pneumothorax is large or causing symptoms, your doctor will remove the air that has collected outside of your lung. He or she can do this in different ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sometimes, the doctor can put a needle through your ribs, then suck out the air using a syringe.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other times, your doctor will make a small hole in between your ribs. He or she will put a tube through the hole and into the collection of air. The tube will stay in your chest for a few days.</p><p/><p>If your doctor uses a large tube (called a &quot;chest tube&quot;), you will need to stay in the hospital while it is in your chest. If your doctor uses a small tube, you might be able to go home during this time.</p><p>If this procedure doesn't work, your doctor might need to do lung surgery to close off the air leak. This surgery is called &quot;thoracoscopy.&quot; During thoracoscopy, the doctor will give you medicine to make you sleep. Then he or she will make 2 or 3 small cuts between the ribs in your chest. He or she will put long, thin tools in these openings and into the space where the air collected. One of the tools has a camera on the end, which sends pictures to a TV screen. The doctor can look at the image on the screen to do the surgery.</p><p>If you need thoracoscopy to treat your pneumothorax, your doctor might do another surgical procedure during thoracoscopy to help prevent a future pneumothorax. He or she might also do this procedure if you have had more than one pneumothorax, even if the air leak stopped quickly.</p><p>Another way to help prevent a future pneumothorax is for your doctor to put a substance in your chest tube. This substance goes into the space where the air collected and helps the lung stick to the chest wall. This helps prevent air from collecting again.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7872010\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do after treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you smoke, you should stop smoking. This can help lower your chance of getting another pneumothorax.</p><p>You should also ask your doctor when you can fly in an airplane or go scuba diving. Some people need to wait a certain amount of time after treatment before it's safe for them to fly or go scuba diving.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7872025\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cystic fibrosis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chest-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chest pain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd-including-emphysema-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including emphysema (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=shortness-of-breath-dyspnea-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Shortness of breath (dyspnea) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=going-home-from-the-hospital-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Going home from the hospital (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd-including-emphysema-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including emphysema (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=shortness-of-breath-dyspnea-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Shortness of breath (dyspnea) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
