Because the tumors have similar clinical presentations and are treated with similar approaches, many clinicians use the term &quot;pheochromocytoma&quot; to refer to both adrenal pheochromocytomas and catecholamine-secreting paragangliomas. However, the distinction between pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma is an important one because of implications for associated neoplasms, risk for malignancy, and genetic testing.</p><p>The clinical presentation and approach to diagnosis of pheochromocytoma are reviewed here. The genetics and treatment of pheochromocytoma and the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of paragangliomas are discussed separately.

It is estimated that the annual incidence of pheochromocytoma is approximately 0.8 per 100,000 person-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pheochromocytoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, this is likely to be an underestimate as 50 percent of pheochromocytomas were diagnosed at autopsy in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pheochromocytoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Although pheochromocytomas may occur at any age, they are most common in the fourth to fifth decade and are equally common in men and women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pheochromocytoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Tumor characteristics are described below. (See <a href=\"#H277138398\" class=\"local\">'Tumor characteristics'</a> below.)</p><p>Most catecholamine-secreting tumors are sporadic. However, approximately 40 percent of patients have the disease as part of a familial disorder; in these patients, the catecholamine-secreting tumors are more likely to be bilateral adrenal pheochromocytomas or paragangliomas.</p><p>Hereditary catecholamine-secreting tumors typically present at a younger age than sporadic neoplasms. Sporadic pheochromocytoma is usually diagnosed on the basis of symptoms or an incidental discovery on computed imaging, whereas syndromic pheochromocytoma is frequently diagnosed earlier in the course of disease because of biochemical surveillance or genetic testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pheochromocytoma-in-genetic-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pheochromocytoma in genetic disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are several familial disorders associated with adrenal pheochromocytoma, all of which have autosomal dominant inheritance: von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2), and less commonly, neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). The approximate frequency of pheochromocytoma in these disorders is 10 to 20 percent in VHL syndrome, 50 percent in MEN2, and 0.1 to 5.7 percent with NF1.

In 1999, at the Mayo Clinic, 15 of 150 patients with a pheochromocytoma were discovered serendipitously by abdominal computed tomography (CT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pheochromocytoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

In another study, 19 of 33 patients (57.6 percent) with adrenal pheochromocytoma diagnosed from 1995 to 2002 were asymptomatic, and their adrenal tumors were discovered incidentally on imaging done for other reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pheochromocytoma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> below.)</p><p>In many patients, pheochromocytoma is found only at autopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pheochromocytoma/abstract/4,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with familial pheochromocytoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When pheochromocytoma is associated with the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2), symptoms are present in only approximately one-half of patients, and only one-third have hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pheochromocytoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. It is not known whether this difference is due to screening for pheochromocytoma in patients with MEN2 or a real difference in the clinical expression of the disease.

Malignant pheochromocytomas are histologically and biochemically the same as benign ones. The only reliable clue to the presence of a malignant pheochromocytoma is local invasion into surrounding tissues and organs (eg, kidney, liver) or distant metastases, which may occur as long as 53 years after resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pheochromocytoma/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. Thus, even when pheochromocytomas or paragangliomas are considered &quot;benign&quot; on pathologic examination, long-term follow-up is indicated in all patients to confirm that impression. Patients with the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) subunit B mutations are more likely to develop metastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pheochromocytoma/abstract/10,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,32,33</a>].</p><p>A variety of immunohistochemical and other prognostic markers have been evaluated for association with malignancy in adrenal pheochromocytomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pheochromocytoma/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>], with mixed results to date.

In these cases, the imaging phenotype guides management (see <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> below). Of note, even among patients suspected to have a pheochromocytoma, the diagnosis is rarely confirmed. In one series, as an example, the diagnosis was established in only 1 of 300 patients evaluated for pheochromocytoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pheochromocytoma/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H277138776\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pheochromocytoma should be suspected in patients who have one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The classic triad of headache, sweating, and tachycardia, whether or not they have hypertension.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperadrenergic spells (eg, self-limited episodes of nonexertional palpitations, diaphoresis, headache, tremor, or pallor).

Tricyclic antidepressants interfere most frequently with the interpretation of plasma fractionated metanephrines and 24-hour urinary catecholamines and metabolites. To effectively screen for catecholamine-secreting tumors, treatment with tricyclic antidepressants (including the muscle relaxant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclobenzaprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclobenzaprine</a>) and other psychoactive agents (but not selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]) listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F80180\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80180 \">table 1</a>) should be tapered and discontinued at least two weeks before any hormonal assessments.</p><p>There are certainly clinical situations for which it is contraindicated to discontinue certain medications (eg, antipsychotics), and if biochemical testing is positive, then computed imaging (eg, computed tomography [CT] scan of the abdomen and pelvis) would be needed to exclude a catecholamine-secreting tumor. Furthermore, catecholamine secretion may be appropriately increased in situations of physical stress or illness (eg, any significant illness requiring hospitalization, stroke, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea). Therefore, the clinical circumstances under which catecholamines and metanephrines are measured must be assessed in each case.</p><p>Levodopa is the most common and only pharmacotherapeutic agent that causes markedly abnormal levels of dopamine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1675094797\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial biochemical tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of pheochromocytoma is typically made by measurements of urinary and plasma fractionated metanephrines and catecholamines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F81154\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef81154 \">algorithm 1</a>). However, there are major regional, institutional, and international differences in the approach to the biochemical diagnosis of pheochromocytoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pheochromocytoma/abstract/2,37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,37-39</a>].</p><p>We suggest initial biochemical testing based upon the index of suspicion that the patient has a pheochromocytoma. If there is a low index of suspicion, we suggest 24-hour urinary fractionated catecholamines and metanephrines; if there is a high index of suspicion, we suggest plasma fractionated metanephrines. Our approach differs from the 2014 Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline, which suggests initial biochemical testing using 24-hour urinary fractionated metanephrines or plasma fractionated metanephrines (drawn supine with an indwelling cannula for 30 minutes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pheochromocytoma/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. However, many clinicians do not measure plasma fractionated metanephrines under these ideal conditions, and the test is associated with a high false-positive rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pheochromocytoma/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Historically, many institutions relied upon measurements of 24-hour urinary excretion of catecholamines and total metanephrines. More recently, plasma fractionated metanephrines have been proposed by some as being a superior test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pheochromocytoma/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The majority of the metabolism of catecholamines is intratumoral, with formation of metanephrine and normetanephrine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pheochromocytoma/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

If the results are normal, no further testing is needed, while if the results are significantly elevated, imaging with CT or MRI is indicated.

This disorder, named pseudopheochromocytoma or hyperadrenergic spells, may be due to stress or emotional distress that is only uncovered after careful psychological evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pheochromocytoma/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

However, the supine position during pregnancy may allow the gravid uterus to compress the tumor, causing paradoxical supine hypertension with normal blood pressure in the sitting or erect position. Furthermore, if hypertension and proteinuria occur, pheochromocytoma may be difficult to distinguish from preeclampsia.</p><p>As in nonpregnant women, the diagnosis is usually based upon the results of 24-hour urinary fractionated metanephrines and catecholamines and plasma fractionated metanephrines.

Stimulation tests and iodine-123 (123-I) metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy are not considered safe for pregnant women.</p><p>Maternal and fetal mortality rates are high, particularly in those who are not diagnosed until delivery.
