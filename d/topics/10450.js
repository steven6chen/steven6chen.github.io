In contrast to extremity soft tissue sarcoma, for which the most common site of first recurrence (at least for intermediate- or high-grade tumors) is a distant site, the primary pattern of treatment failure after resection of RPS is local. In one multicenter series of 1007 patients undergoing resection of a primary RPS, 408 developed recurrent disease during follow-up, 219 with local recurrence alone (54 percent), 146 with distant metastases alone (36 percent), and the remainder (10 percent) with local plus distant recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-recurrent-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-evaluation-and-treatment-of-retroperitoneal-soft-tissue-sarcoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, evaluation, and treatment of retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Locoregional recurrences can occur in the tumor bed, and they may also be multifocal or multicentric. In an analysis of 247 patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">well-differentiated/dedifferentiated</span> liposarcoma arising in the retroperitoneum, 66 of 142 well-differentiated liposarcomas recurred locoregionally, and of these, 33 (50 percent) were unifocal and the remainder were multifocal (defined as the presence of two or more tumors in the retroperitoneum) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-recurrent-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Of the 33 multifocal recurrences, 11 (33 percent) were multicentric and outside field (defined as development of at least one tumor in a compartment remote from the index tumor). Patients with multifocal recurrent disease had inferior survival compared with those with unifocal recurrent disease. Of the 105 patients with dedifferentiated liposarcomas, 48 recurred locoregionally, and one-half of these were unifocal. Of the 33 multifocal recurrences, seven were multicentric and outside field. Survival was not significantly worse for those with multifocal recurrent disease.</p><p>Several factors contribute to a high rate of local recurrence for RPS compared with extremity soft tissue sarcoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-recurrent-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-evaluation-and-treatment-of-retroperitoneal-soft-tissue-sarcoma#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, evaluation, and treatment of retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma&quot;, section on 'Outcomes and prognostic factors'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RPS are often large at diagnosis and anatomically situated such that wide resection is often not achievable.

As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a single-institution prospective database of 675 patients treated surgically for primary nonmetastatic RPS from 1982 to 2010, the five-year cumulative incidence of local recurrence was 39 percent, and the independent factors for local recurrence were incomplete resection, tumor size, and histologic type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-recurrent-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The highest local recurrence rates were in liposarcomas of all subtypes (approximately 60 percent by 15 years), but early recurrences were especially pronounced with the dedifferentiated, round cell, and pleomorphic liposarcoma subtypes (the majority recurred within five years). Rates of local recurrence were lowest in leiomyosarcoma (approximately 22 percent) and solitary fibrous tumor (approximately 10 percent). Patients undergoing a macroscopically incomplete (R2) resection were 2.5 times more likely to have local progression compared with those with a complete or microscopically complete <span class=\"nowrap\">(R1/R0)</span> resection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The influence of histologic type on patterns of recurrence was further shown in a series of 1007 consecutive patients with localized primary RPS who underwent resection between January 2002 and December 2011 at eight international centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-recurrent-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

The median tumor size was 15 cm (range 2 to 70 cm), 31 percent presented with neurovascular or bone involvement, 39 percent had grade 3 lesions, and 30 percent had liposarcoma subtype. Complete (macroscopic) excision had been carried out in 94, and 60 of these patients received postoperative RT (median dose 50 Gy). Among the patients who underwent complete excision, the five-year actuarial local recurrence-free survival was significantly greater for the 60 irradiated patients compared with the 34 who did not receive it (55 versus 23 percent). The benefit of adjuvant RT for primary RPS is discussed in detail elsewhere.

All relevant imaging studies performed prior to resection of the primary RPS should be obtained and reviewed, as should all subsequent imaging studies, including the initial postoperative baseline imaging to determine the initial disease stage and whether residual gross disease remained after the initial resection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-evaluation-and-treatment-of-retroperitoneal-soft-tissue-sarcoma#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, evaluation, and treatment of retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma&quot;, section on 'Radiographic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>The current extent of local and distant disease should be determined using an oral and intravenous contrast-enhanced thin slice (2.5 to 5 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-recurrent-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]) multidetector row computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis to evaluate the primary site, as well as a chest CT to rule out metastatic disease to the lungs. The lungs are the first site of metastasis in the majority of cases. Current imaging should be compared with all prior imaging to ascertain the extent and progression of recurrent disease, with attention to the pattern of relapse (locoregional versus peritoneal versus distant to other sites), whether there is evidence of invasion into adjacent <span class=\"nowrap\">organs/critical</span> structures, and the rate of progression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-histopathology-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging-of-soft-tissue-sarcoma#H12227156\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, histopathology, diagnostic evaluation, and staging of soft tissue sarcoma&quot;, section on 'MRI and CT'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-histopathology-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging-of-soft-tissue-sarcoma#H12227107\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, histopathology, diagnostic evaluation, and staging of soft tissue sarcoma&quot;, section on 'Pattern of spread'</a>.)</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be a useful ancillary modality in selected cases to define the extent of local invasion into adjacent <span class=\"nowrap\">organs/structures</span> that is not clear on CT, but it is not required in most cases.

Integrated <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> scanning can achieve whole body imaging and is widely considered to be more sensitive than CT for the detection of occult distant metastases in a variety of solid tumors. One reported benefit in soft tissue sarcomas as a group is to detect sites of extrapulmonary metastatic disease. However, the risk is so low with most soft tissue sarcomas (including RPS) that routine use of PET for this purpose is unlikely to change the therapeutic plan. However, imaging with <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> may have a role in patients with clinical suspicion of recurrent RPS if the results on cross-sectional imaging are difficult to interpret. As examples, <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> may help to clarify the situation if the extent of active abdominal disease is difficult to evaluate, such as with possible peritoneal implants or when distinguishing postsurgical changes from tumor, or if there is uncertainty about different imaging characteristics in multifocal lesions that might alter management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-recurrent-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].

Patients are more appropriately referred, at least initially, for systemic chemotherapy.

Where feasible, reresection should be attempted for an isolated locally recurrent tumor. Approximately 60 percent of such tumors are potentially resectable, and five-year survival rates after reresection may be as high as 50 percent. Patients most likely to benefit from resection are those with a longer disease-free interval, no history of tumor rupture at primary resection, low-grade tumors (especially well-differentiated liposarcomas), and unifocal rather than multifocal disease. Multifocal intraabdominal disease is difficult to resect completely, will almost certainly recur again, and carries a poor prognosis, particularly with resection alone. Because the oncologic benefit of surgery is likely to be limited and the risk of morbidity substantial, a very careful approach to patient selection for surgical intervention is required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-recurrent-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The surgeon will need to weigh all factors, including the age of the patient, the tumor biology (ie, the strategy for a recurrent well-differentiated liposarcoma will be very different from that for a dedifferentiated liposarcoma or leiomyosarcoma), the likelihood of achieving a complete resection, and the anticipated surgical morbidity. (See <a href=\"#H2120018433\" class=\"local\">'Surgical reresection'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who did not receive radiation therapy (RT) as part of initial therapy for their sarcoma, we suggest adjunctive RT. For most patients, we prefer preoperative rather than postoperative RT. Intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) may also be an option. (See <a href=\"#H2702343972\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H285629381\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although not used in the United States, preoperative regional hyperthermia with systemic chemotherapy is another therapeutic option for locally recurrent tumors in parts of the world where it is available (mainly Germany), especially for previously irradiated patients. Whether this approach is superior to surgery, with or without RT, or chemoradiotherapy will require a randomized trial. (See <a href=\"#H4198176219\" class=\"local\">'Prior radiation therapy'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with an unresectable disease recurrence (ie, cannot be resected due to involvement or encasement of critical structures such as the aorta, superior mesenteric vessels, porta hepatis, or major nerve roots), the role of surgical debulking is unclear. Repeated debulking surgery may be a reasonable option for some patients with low-grade liposarcomas, although complete resection is preferred, if feasible. For other patients, debulking surgery does not improve long-term survival, and it should not be attempted. Some unresectable RPS may be controlled long term (and possibly cured) with the use of high-dose charged-particle irradiation. However, availability of this technology is limited to a few specialized centers. As noted above, the surgeon will need to weigh all factors, including the age of the patient, the tumor biology (ie, the strategy for a recurrent well-differentiated liposarcoma will be very different from that for a dedifferentiated liposarcoma or leiomyosarcoma), the likelihood of achieving a complete resection, and the anticipated surgical morbidity.

As an example, in one multicenter series of 219 patients with locally recurrent RPS, the two-year overall survival rates for those undergoing resection versus no resection were 73 and 43 percent, respectively, while at five years, overall survival rates were 43 and 11 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-recurrent-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The addition of IORT may improve the local control rate in patients undergoing an operation for recurrent RPS, although the available data are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-recurrent-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. In one series of 32 such patients, 20 of whom had locally recurrent disease, patients received maximal tumor resection, IORT, and postoperative RT where feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-recurrent-retroperitoneal-sarcoma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

However, with each local recurrence, there is a greater need for more complex en bloc resections, and tumor resectability dramatically diminishes with each reoperation.

However, in contrast to extremity soft tissue sarcomas, the primary pattern of treatment failure after resection of RPS is local. Recurrences may be delayed beyond five years. Factors that determine the frequency of local recurrence include tumor size, histologic subtype and grade, status of the surgical margins, and whether adjunctive radiation therapy (RT) was administered. (See <a href=\"#H3535677725\" class=\"local\">'Frequency of local recurrence, time course, and risk factors'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiographic imaging is a key component of the evaluation of a patient with a suspected local recurrence of RPS. The current extent of local and distant disease should be determined using an oral and intravenous contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis to evaluate the primary site, as well as a chest CT to rule out metastatic disease to the lungs. Current imaging should be compared with all relevant imaging studies performed prior to resection of the primary RPS and with the initial postoperative baseline imaging. (See <a href=\"#H1575095966\" class=\"local\">'Pretreatment assessment'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most significant predictor of outcome following local recurrence is the resectability of the recurrent disease. Where feasible, reresection should be attempted for an isolated locally recurrent tumor; approximately 60 percent of such tumors are potentially resectable, and five-year survival rates may be as high as 50 percent. Patients most likely to benefit from resection are those with a longer disease-free interval, no history of tumor rupture at primary resection, low-grade tumors (especially well-differentiated liposarcomas), and unifocal rather than multifocal disease. (See <a href=\"#H1295798909\" class=\"local\">'Potentially resectable disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who did not receive RT as part of initial therapy for their sarcoma, we suggest adjunctive RT (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, for most patients, we prefer preoperative rather than postoperative RT. Intraoperative RT may also be an option. (See <a href=\"#H70327997\" class=\"local\">'No prior radiation therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An option for patients who have received prior RT is preoperative systemic chemotherapy with or without regional hyperthermia. Although not used in the United States, preoperative regional hyperthermia with systemic chemotherapy is used for locally recurrent tumors in parts of the world where it is available (mainly Germany). Whether this approach is superior to surgery, with or without RT, or chemotherapy alone will require a randomized trial. (See <a href=\"#H4198176219\" class=\"local\">'Prior radiation therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with unresectable locally recurrent disease, the role of surgical debulking is unclear. Repeated debulking surgery may be a reasonable option for some patients with low-grade liposarcomas, although complete resection is preferred, if feasible. For other patients, debulking surgery does not improve long-term survival, and it should not be attempted. (See <a href=\"#H1664736976\" class=\"local\">'Surgical debulking'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some unresectable RPS may be controlled long term (and possibly cured) with the use of high-dose charged-particle irradiation. However, availability of this technology is limited to a few specialized centers. Another option is palliative systemic chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H535088708\" class=\"local\">'Locally unresectable disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following treatment, patients should be followed with regular cross-sectional imaging, given the high risk for further relapse.
