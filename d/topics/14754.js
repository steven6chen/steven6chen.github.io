The virus spreads by bites or scratches from animals that have rabies. It gets into the body from the animal's saliva and spreads to the brain.</p><p>In the United States, certain wild animals are more likely than other animals to give people rabies. These animals include bats, raccoons, skunks, foxes, and coyotes. Bat bites are especially likely to spread rabies. It is also possible to get rabies from dogs and cats that have not had a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabies-virus-vaccine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">rabies vaccine</a>.</p><p>In countries in Africa and Asia, dogs are the most likely wild animal to spread rabies. That's because in these countries, most dogs do not get a rabies shot. But other animals can also spread rabies in these countries.</p><p>Rabies is a very serious disease. People infected with rabies almost always die if they do not get treatment right away, before symptoms start.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17587927\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of rabies?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rabies symptoms in humans include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling sick, like you have the flu &ndash; A person with rabies might not feel like eating. He or she might have a fever, sore throat, headache, nausea, and vomiting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acting irritable, excited, or more active than normal</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Painful or tingling areas on the skin</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fear of water or choking on water</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weakness in the arms and legs &ndash; A person with this symptom might also leak urine.</p><p/><p>Animals with rabies can act strangely. For example, they might:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attack people and other animals</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Come out in daylight when they are normally out at night &ndash; For example, bats and raccoons are not usually out during the day.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17587942\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. See a doctor or nurse right away if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You are bitten by a wild animal, especially a bat, raccoon, skunk, fox, or coyote.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You were around a bat or woke up in the room with a bat (bat bites can be hard to see).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You were bitten by a dog, cat, or ferret you know or think has rabies. You should also see a doctor or nurse if you do not know if the dog, cat, or ferret that bit you had rabies shots. Many pets in the United States get rabies shots, but not all do.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You are in a country where rabies is common (for example, an African or Asian country) and an animal bites or scratches you.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17587959\"><span class=\"h1\">Can doctors tell if the animal that bit me has rabies?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sometimes. If a pet bites you and it seems healthy, it can go to a safe place such as an animal hospital for doctors to watch it. Doctors can watch it for 10 days to see if it gets sick. If it stays healthy, you do not need rabies shots. If the pet gets sick, you need shots right away.</p><p>If a wild animal bites you, or a strange pet bites you and gets away, you might need rabies shots. See your doctor or nurse right away.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17587976\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a doctor thinks you have rabies, he or she will do tests. The tests can show if you have the virus or were exposed to it. Also, some other diseases cause symptoms similar to rabies, so a doctor might do tests for these diseases too.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17587993\"><span class=\"h1\">How is rabies treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once rabies symptoms start, no treatment works well. Most people with rabies symptoms die. That is why preventing rabies is so important. If you think you were exposed to rabies, getting treatment right away can stop the virus from spreading in your body and causing symptoms.</p><p>If a person has rabies symptoms, doctors can give treatments to make him or her more comfortable. These treatments are given in the hospital. They include treatments to relieve pain and trouble breathing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17588008\"><span class=\"h1\">Can rabies be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If an animal bites you, do these things right away:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash the wound with lots of soap and water, even if it stings you. You can also use an antiseptic such as povidone-iodine (brand name: Betadine).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Call your doctor or nurse, or go to the emergency room right away.</p><p/><p>Other ways to prevent rabies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you have pets, make sure they get rabies shots as often as needed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not touch wild animals, even if they look dead.</p><p/><p>If you were bitten by an animal that could have rabies, you need a series of shots to prevent rabies.</p><p>Some people who work with animals can get shots to help prevent rabies, even if they have never had a scratch or bite. But they still need to see a doctor or nurse and get more shots if an animal that could have rabies bites them.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17588023\"><span class=\"h1\">Are rabies shots safe for pregnant women?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Shots to prevent rabies are safe for an unborn baby. If you are pregnant and an animal that could have rabies bites or scratches you, see a doctor or nurse right away.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17588040\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=animal-and-human-bites-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Animal and human bites (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-travel-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for travel (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabies-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Rabies (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
