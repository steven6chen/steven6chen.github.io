The cause of preterm cervical shortening is often unclear. It has been attributed to several sources, including occult uterine activity, uterine overdistention, congenital or acquired cervical insufficiency, decidual hemorrhage, infection, inflammation, and biological variation.</p><p>Management of pregnant women with a short cervix may involve progesterone supplementation or cerclage, which are discussed in detail separately.

A decrease in cervical length in the second trimester is predictive of spontaneous preterm birth, with the highest risk in women with early and substantial cervical shortening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-evaluation-of-cervical-length-for-prediction-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>]. Because effacement begins at the internal cervical os and progresses caudally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-evaluation-of-cervical-length-for-prediction-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>], it is often detected on ultrasound examination before it can be appreciated on physical examination.</p><p>Identification of women with a short cervix is important because treatment with vaginal progesterone can reduce their risk of preterm birth. In a 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials, vaginal progesterone treatment of women with a short cervix reduced the frequency of preterm birth by 35 percent and reduced composite neonatal morbidity and mortality by 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-evaluation-of-cervical-length-for-prediction-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

The number needed to screen to prevent preterm birth has been estimated to be 913 (95% CI 591-1494) with universal screening versus 474 (95% CI 291-892) when only women with one risk factor for preterm birth are screened and 125 (95% CI 56-399) when only women with two risk factors for preterm birth are screened [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-evaluation-of-cervical-length-for-prediction-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>Whether cervical length screening should be performed in all pregnant women or limited to those at high risk of spontaneous preterm birth is controversial. A 2013 Cochrane review of randomized trials did not find sufficient evidence to recommend routine cervical length screening for all pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-evaluation-of-cervical-length-for-prediction-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The value of cervical length screening could not be determined because of limitations of the included trials: The threshold for short cervix and timing of the screening examination(s) varied among the trials; there was no standard protocol for management of women based on cervical length, and the populations were heterogeneous. Population characteristics that could affect the performance of the test include the proportion of singleton versus multiple gestation, symptomatic versus asymptomatic women, intact membranes versus ruptured membranes, prior preterm birth versus no prior preterm birth, prior term birth versus no prior term birth, and prior cervical surgery versus no prior cervical surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-evaluation-of-cervical-length-for-prediction-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/1,28-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,28-36</a>]. </p><p>The overall value of universal cervical length screen continues to be debated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-evaluation-of-cervical-length-for-prediction-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>]; however, at least one decision analysis concluded that in women without a prior spontaneous preterm birth, universal cervical length screening was cost-effective compared with both risk-based screening and no screening in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-evaluation-of-cervical-length-for-prediction-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3545998719\"><span class=\"h2\">Recommendations from selected national and international organizations</span></p><p>In the United States:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) &ndash; The SMFM recommends routine transvaginal ultrasound cervical length screening between 16 and 24 weeks of gestation for women with a singleton pregnancy and history of prior spontaneous preterm birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-evaluation-of-cervical-length-for-prediction-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. They consider screening reasonable for women with a singleton pregnancy and no history of prior spontaneous preterm birth but have not recommended routine screening for this population.

Lower values have also been observed: A large prospective study reported 8 percent sensitivity for preterm birth among nulliparous women with singleton gestations and cervical length &le;25 mm at 16 to 22 weeks of gestation and 23 percent sensitivity for measurements performed at 22 to 30 weeks. However, clinicians and patients were informed when the cervical length was &lt;15 mm, and intervention to reduce the risk for preterm birth was initiated; cervical length screening was often started too early in these patients (&lt;18 weeks), and hundreds of women with high-risk factors for preterm birth could not be included because of missing outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-evaluation-of-cervical-length-for-prediction-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

We perform TVU cervical length screening in all pregnancies because this technique is more reliable than transabdominal measurement (see <a href=\"#H2190870338\" class=\"local\">'Use of transvaginal sonography'</a> below), and interventions are available that reduce the risk of preterm delivery in women with a short cervix.

All women with risk factors for preterm birth undergo transvaginal ultrasound cervical length screening. Although this approach decreases the number of transvaginal ultrasound examinations that need to be performed and thus saves time, in our experience, some cases of short cervix with subsequent preterm birth will be missed by this approach.

All women with risk factors for preterm birth undergo transvaginal ultrasound cervical length screening. </p><p>An American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine practice guideline for performance of obstetric ultrasound examination advises that if the cervix appears short or is not adequately seen during transabdominal evaluation, a TVU or transperineal approach can be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-evaluation-of-cervical-length-for-prediction-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. In patients who have a well-imaged long cervical length on transabdominal sonography, a prospective study concluded that TVU may be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-evaluation-of-cervical-length-for-prediction-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some clinicians find the cervix is easier to locate sonographically if a digital examination is performed first as gel from the examiner's glove left in the cervical canal makes the external os more echogenic. In addition, digital examination aids in the assessment of risk of premature delivery by providing information on cervical dilation, position, and consistency - features not optimally assessed by ultrasound. However, experienced sonographers generally omit digital examination, and we do not perform it.</p><p>The basic steps for the TVU technique are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient should empty her bladder prior to the examination.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultrasound gel is placed on a transvaginal probe before covering it with a condom (or specialized probe cover), and then more ultrasound gel is placed on top of the cover. If the membranes are ruptured, both the cover and the gel should be sterile.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With the real-time image in view, the transducer is gently inserted into the anterior fornix until the cervix is visualized while avoiding excessive pressure on the anterior cervical lip. The image of the cervix is enlarged to fill at least one-half of the ultrasound screen and oriented so that cephalad is to the left of the screen. Fetal membranes in the cervical canal or beyond the cervix should be noted, if present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The amniotic fluid in the lower uterine segment is assessed and then the lowest edge of the empty maternal bladder. The internal os is then located, often just below this edge.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The appropriate sagittal long-axis view for measuring cervical length includes the usually V-shaped notch at the internal os, the triangular area of echodensity at the external os, and the endocervical canal, which appears as a faint line of echodensity or echolucency between the two (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F82336\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82336 \">figure 1</a>). Excess pressure on the cervix can artificially increase its apparent length. This can be avoided by first obtaining an apparently satisfactory image, withdrawing the probe until the image blurs, and then reapplying only enough pressure to restore the image (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72281\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72281 \">image 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cervical length is represented by the line made by the interface of the mucosal surfaces (the closed portion of the cervix). It is usually the distance between calipers placed at the notches made by the internal os and external os. If the internal os is open (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F62467\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62467 \">image 2</a>), cervical length is measured from the tip of the funnel to the external os (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F82336\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82336 \">figure 1</a>). Cervical length should only be determined from images in which the lowermost edge of the empty maternal bladder and the internal and external os are visible and when the anterior and posterior lips of the cervix are of approximately equal thickness. If the cervix appears asymmetric (thin anteriorly and thicker posteriorly), this suggests excessive probe pressure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At times, the cervical canal is curved. In these cases, the length of the cervix can be measured in either of two ways:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The length of a single, straight line from the internal to external os can be measured.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The sum of two separate, straight lines joined at an angle along the curved length of cervix is determined: This sum is used for the cervical length if the distance between the angle and a straight line from the internal to external os is &gt;5 mm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F61433\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61433 \">image 3</a>) as it may provide a more accurate measurement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-evaluation-of-cervical-length-for-prediction-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We avoid tracing the cervical canal because it introduces unpredictable operator variation.

It is important to allow at least five minutes for the total examination and a couple of minutes between the gentle application of fundal pressure and recording the presence of a short cervix as it takes time for development of dynamic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> &quot;transfundal pressure elicited&quot; changes in the cervix [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-evaluation-of-cervical-length-for-prediction-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If a short (or shorter) cervical length is seen after application of fundal pressure, the length of the residual closed portion of the cervix is taken three times, with the shortest length recorded in millimeters as the best estimate of the true length of the cervix. This length best correlates with duration of pregnancy. Only one measurement should be reported: the shortest best cervical length (mm) of all measurements taken.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3056568696\"><span class=\"h2\">Pitfalls in measuring cervical length</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following pitfalls can lead to suboptimal measurement of cervical length, typically resulting in overestimation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Excessive pressure</strong> &ndash; Placing excessive pressure on the cervix during the examination is a common mistake in performing TVU. This creates an artificially longer cervix due to compression of the anterior cervical lip and lower uterine segment. As discussed above, this may be avoided by withdrawing the probe when the internal and external os are visualized until slight blurring occurs, and then the probe is inserted slightly until a clear image returns. The anterior and posterior lips of the cervix should be of approximately equal thickness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F82336\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82336 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Not allowing enough time to view dynamic changes</strong> &ndash; Measuring cervical length too quickly is common and can result in an accurate measurement. It is important to allow adequate time (approximately five minutes) for any effects of transient pressure on the cervix to resolve.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Uterine contractions</strong> &ndash; Contractions during the examination can cause a false impression of a long cervix. If the internal os is not clearly visualized and a contraction is present, the sonographer needs to wait until the contraction resolves before the cervical length can be measured accurately. Contraction of the lower uterine segment can mimic funneling with a normal residual cervical length.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Underdevelopment of the lower uterine segment</strong> &ndash; As discussed above, before 14 weeks, it is more difficult to differentiate between the lower uterine segment and true cervix as the pregnancy has not yet expanded to the whole uterus. Placenta previa may create this same problem, resulting in an artificially increased cervical length.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If the lower uterine segment is underdeveloped, it can be difficult to identify the true internal os, and some myometrium may be included in the cervical length measurement. This should be suspected when the cervix appears longer than 50 mm or the internal os is cephalad above the bladder reflection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-evaluation-of-cervical-length-for-prediction-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Funneling has been variably defined according to the depth of protrusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-evaluation-of-cervical-length-for-prediction-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the ratio of the funnel depth to the length of funnel plus the remaining closed cervix [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-evaluation-of-cervical-length-for-prediction-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. As the cervix effaces, the relationship between the lower uterine segment and the axis of the cervical canal also changes and is described according to the shape of the letters &quot;T,&quot; &quot;Y,&quot; &quot;V,&quot; and &quot;U&quot; (mnemonic: Trust Your Vaginal Ultrasound) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72366\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72366 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-trimester-evaluation-of-cervical-length-for-prediction-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. &quot;T&quot; represents the normal relationship of the area where the endocervical canal meets the uterine cavity, whereas &quot;U&quot; represents almost complete effacement and signifies the highest risk for preterm birth. Representative endovaginal ultrasound images that display these changes are shown in the following ultrasounds (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F77352%7EOBGYN%2F66107%7EOBGYN%2F52234\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77352 graphicRef66107 graphicRef52234 \">image 5A-C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The length of the funnel is often uncertain because landmarks, such as the shoulder of the internal os, may not be distinct; therefore, we do not measure funnel length or use it for clinical management.
