Severe generalized edema is known as anasarca. More localized interstitial fluid collections include ascites and pleural effusions.</p><p>The diagnostic approach to edema is based upon a thoughtful approach to the pathogenesis of its formation. Once a diagnosis is established, specific treatment of the underlying disorder can be given. If specific therapy is not available, general treatment such as optimization of fluid management can be considered.</p><p>The evaluation and management of edema in children will be presented in this topic review. The pathogenesis and etiology of edema in children are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-edema-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and etiology of edema in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of the evaluation of a child with edema include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determine the underlying pathophysiology, character of the edema (localized or generalized), and cause, as it will guide both evaluation and treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68106\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68106 \">table 1</a>). A more detailed discussion on the etiology based on the pathogenesis of the edema is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-edema-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and etiology of edema in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identify those conditions that are potentially life-threatening or have serious medical consequences, although most causes of edema are self-limiting disorders. Potentially life-threatening or serious medical disorders include anaphylaxis, hereditary angioedema with laryngeal involvement, decreased cardiac output (especially as a result of myocarditis or restrictive pericarditis), and hepatic and renal disease.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of a child with edema begins with a thorough history. The following should be included:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Edema location.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duration of symptoms. Establishing a time course is important in distinguishing an acquired condition from a congenital condition.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Associated complaints that suggest systemic disease or major organ dysfunction. As an example, shortness of breath suggests heart failure <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pulmonary edema.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional concurrent illnesses or signs. A streptococcal infection one to three weeks earlier may point to poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Past medical and family history. A family history of recurrent angioedema, for example, may suggest hereditary angioedema as a possible diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight gain and tight-fitting clothes and shoes. Such changes may have been ignored by parents as they were thought to be normal signs of growth, rather than the onset of edema because of nephrosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient age at time of edema onset. Edema of the hands and feet of a newborn girl is suggestive of Turner syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of allergies and current medications. Allergies and adverse reaction to certain medications can present as angioedema in childhood.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The focus of the physical examination includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measuring the child's growth parameters.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fully evaluating the cardiovascular system, including vital signs. Findings of tachycardia, tachypnea, gallop, rales, or hepatomegaly are seen in patients with heart failure, whereas tachypnea and rales alone may be indicative of pulmonary edema. Increased blood pressure (BP) levels may reflect hypervolemia resulting from <span class=\"nowrap\">acute/chronic</span> renal failure or glomerulonephritis. BP measurements are interpreted in relation to the patient's age, gender, and height percentile (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63856\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63856 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52646\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52646 \">table 3</a>). The age- and height-specific BP percentiles may be determined using calculators for boys (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-blood-pressure-percentiles-for-boys-0-to-17-years-old-revised-2017\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) or for girls (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-blood-pressure-percentiles-for-girls-0-to-17-years-old-revised-2017\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-diagnosis-of-hypertension-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and diagnosis of hypertension in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Characterizing the edema as localized or generalized, and assessing the extent of edema. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Edema'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Edema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Peripheral edema is detected by the presence of pitting after pressure is applied to the edematous area. Pitting reflects movement of the excess interstitial water in response to pressure. Because peripheral edema locates preferentially in dependent areas, it is primarily found in the lower extremities of ambulatory patients and over the sacrum in patients at bed rest.</p><p>When the edema is nonpitting, lymphedema (which may also be associated with pitting edema) or pretibial myxedema should be considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-lymphedema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of peripheral lymphedema&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pretibial-myxedema-thyroid-dermopathy-in-autoimmune-thyroid-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pretibial myxedema (thyroid dermopathy) in autoimmune thyroid disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As mentioned above, the evaluation is affected by the location of edema:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Generalized edema &ndash; If generalized edema is present, the child should be evaluated for pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, ascites, <span class=\"nowrap\">scrotal/labial</span> edema, or evidence of skin breakdown in regions of edema.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pulmonary findings of decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion are consistent with pleural effusion, although pulmonary edema is suggested by adventitial sounds such as rales. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ascites is associated with abdominal distention, and shifting dullness and a fluid wave on percussion of the abdomen. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with the nephrotic syndrome also may have prominent periorbital edema because of the low tissue hydrostatic pressure in this area; this finding is usually worse in the morning and improves with ambulation due to the dependent nature of this type of edema.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Localized edema &ndash; With regional edema, the clinician should localize the area of swelling to help deduce where a region of venous or lymphatic obstruction is likely to be present, or if localized allergen exposure has occurred. Because cellulitis also can manifest with regional edema, assessment of the patient for fever and local signs of inflammation is important. If the edema is localized to the face, the child also should be carefully evaluated for concurrent airway involvement, which can be life-threatening.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Clues from constellations of symptoms and signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The child with edema must be assessed for associated symptoms or other medical conditions that may help suggest the underlying etiology. The following are groupings of signs and symptoms found in a variety of diseases that cause edema in children.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A child with diaphoresis, dyspnea on exertion, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a history of heart disease may have edema secondary to cardiac failure. Findings on clinical examination include tachycardia, tachypnea, rales, hepatomegaly, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> gallop.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A child with a history of food allergies may present acutely with urticaria and angioedema after allergen exposure. If there is airway involvement, this is a medical emergency and requires emergent therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-airway-management-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic airway management in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A history of jaundice, failure to thrive, steatorrhea, or abdominal pain should point the clinician toward a diagnosis of chronic liver disease or possibly a protein-losing enteropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-edema-in-children/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A child with progressive anasarca with a significant periorbital component, but minimal systemic complaints, may have nephrotic syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cola-colored urine with either generalized or facial edema strongly suggests acute glomerulonephritis. These patients also may have hypertension.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Edema, anorexia, and growth impairment can be seen in a child with chronic renal failure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family history of angioedema favors a diagnosis of hereditary angioedema.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A newborn girl with edema of the hands and feet, webbed neck, nail dysplasia, high palate, and short fourth metacarpal may have Turner syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Findings on urinalysis, complete blood count (CBC), serum chemistry tests (serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen [BUN], albumin, and liver function studies), echocardiography (if clinically indicated), and other tests may suggest or confirm the underlying cause of edema.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Urinalysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A urinalysis including a dipstick for proteinuria must be obtained in all children with edema. Dipstick testing principally detects albumin. The finding of a markedly positive dipstick for protein in combination with hypoalbuminemia and clinical edema is virtually diagnostic of the nephrotic syndrome. False-positive results may be obtained with very alkaline or concentrated urines, or when urine is contaminated by some antiseptic agents (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">chlorhexidine</a> or benzalkonium chloride). However, highly positive results (&gt;300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> cannot be explained by a concentrated urine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-proteinuria-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of proteinuria in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-idiopathic-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-and-infantile-nephrotic-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital and infantile nephrotic syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Examination of the urine sediment may reveal hematuria, pyuria, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cellular casts. In the edematous child with renal disease, different patterns of urinary findings favor different renal diseases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinalysis-in-the-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinalysis in the diagnosis of kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>With glomerular diseases, for example:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hematuria with red cell casts and dysmorphic red cells, with or without heavy proteinuria, is virtually diagnostic of glomerulonephritis, such as poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. This constellation of urinary findings is called a nephritic sediment. The absence of red cell casts does not exclude the diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heavy proteinuria, but few cells or casts, is most consistent with a noninflammatory cause of nephrotic syndrome such as minimal change disease (MCD) or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Serum laboratory tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial serum laboratory evaluation in the child with edema without an apparent cause should include a CBC, and serum chemistries including renal and liver function tests and albumin level. Based upon the results of these initial tests, the clinical history, physical examination, and urinalysis; additional serum laboratory tests may be helpful.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal disease:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In the child with suspected acute glomerulonephritis, the serum complement component 3 (C3) level is a useful diagnostic test, as causes of glomerulonephritis can be classified as either hypocomplementemic or normocomplementemic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53697\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53697 \">table 4</a>). In addition, the presence of antistreptococcal antibodies, antinuclear antibodies (ANA), antiglomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibodies, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA) favors the diagnosis of specific disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glomerular-disease-evaluation-and-differential-diagnosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glomerular disease: Evaluation and differential diagnosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If only nephrotic syndrome is present, a series of serologic tests also are frequently ordered as part of the routine evaluation. These include C3, C4, ANA, and anti-double stranded DNA to screen for underlying diseases such as membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Serologic screening for markers of occult viral infection that affects the kidneys include tests for hepatitis B (hepatitis B surface antigen and core antibody), hepatitis C (antibody), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (antibody) infection. However, a positive serology does not prove that the renal disease is a result of the viral infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glomerular-disease-evaluation-and-differential-diagnosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glomerular disease: Evaluation and differential diagnosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Most causes of acute or chronic renal failure in children can cause edema. The evaluation of this problem is discussed in detail separately.

In this setting, liver function tests, total serum protein levels, and prothrombin times should be obtained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-edema-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In addition, stool level of alpha-1 antitrypsin is the best screening test for protein-losing enteropathy.

If thrombosis is diagnosed, additional studies may include the measurement of antithrombin III, protein S, protein C concentrations, factor V Leiden, and antiphospholipid antibody levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-edema-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

One notable cause for hydrops is hemolytic disease of the newborn, which may be because of ABO blood type incompatibility or Rh disease. To diagnose this disorder, a CBC and serology testing should be obtained.

With the inherited forms, C4 and C2 levels are chronically low in the majority of patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary angioedema: Pathogenesis and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different imaging studies may be indicated based upon the results of the clinical evaluation and laboratory studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Renal ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of safety, ease of use, and the information provided, the most commonly used radiographic technique in patients presenting with renal disease is renal ultrasonography. Ultrasonography allows the clinician to characterize kidney size and assess for cystic renal disease and hydronephrosis. Renal ultrasonography is helpful in the following clinical settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An edematous newborn male with bilateral hydronephrosis may have obstructive uropathy from posterior urethral valves (PUV).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A teenager with renal failure and small shrunken kidneys may have congenital renal hypoplasia, scarring from reflux nephropathy, or simply chronic renal failure of any cause.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Doppler ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doppler ultrasonography (or other studies assessing vascular flow) is indicated in the child with suspected venous thrombosis.

A biopsy also may be obtained in the setting of unexplained acute or subacute renal failure.</p><p>A child with presumed idiopathic nephrotic syndrome is <strong>not</strong> typically biopsied at the outset of the disease. A trial of corticosteroid treatment is typically offered, with a renal biopsy reserved for steroid-resistant patients.

A sodium-restricted diet is tailored to provide the child with approximately 2 to 3 mEq of <span class=\"nowrap\">sodium/kg</span> per day, the amount of sodium required for a growing child. A 10 kg child should therefore receive between 20 to 30 mEq of sodium per day or 460 to 690 mg of sodium per day. This strategy is continued up to a maximum sodium intake of 2000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> in larger children.</p><p>Fluid restriction can be considered in patients with generalized edema, but must be done cautiously in patients with reduced effective circulating blood volume of noncardiac origin. This includes children with nephrotic syndrome and hepatic cirrhosis. Fluid limitations are based on specific patient characteristics and underlying cause. Patients with edema associated with the nephrotic syndrome who are being managed in the outpatient setting should be treated with sodium restriction, but not fluid restriction. Fluid restriction may result in a compromised intravascular volume, which could exacerbate the thrombotic tendency of this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-edema-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Diuretics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with edema and an associated expanded intravascular volume may be candidates for diuretic therapy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with heart failure with increased hydrostatic pressure and hypervolemia due to water and sodium retention may benefit from fluid removal. This can be achieved with the use of loop diuretics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">furosemide</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diuretics also are useful in the treatment of edema resulting from renal dysfunction with acute glomerulonephritis and acute or chronic renal failure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>However, diuretics need to be used cautiously in children with edema and a reduced effective circulatory volume, as observed with ascites due to cirrhosis. There are two major concerns with diuretic therapy for cirrhotic ascites: overly rapid removal of fluid and progressive electrolyte imbalance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aggressive diuresis of these patients may precipitate hepatorenal syndrome and overt renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-edema-in-children/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. The clinician must therefore closely monitor the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine concentration, as any unexplained deterioration of renal function would imply an untoward effect on renal blood flow.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loop diuretics can induce a hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, which can lead to increased ammonia production by the renal tubules and result in a hepatic coma in patients with early hepatic encephalopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-edema-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p>Thus, in the child with cirrhotic ascites, it is probably most prudent to use sodium restriction and possibly add <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">spironolactone</a> to avoid the risks of hypokalemia. Spironolactone also is occasionally combined with loop diuretics in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-edema-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ascites in adults with cirrhosis: Initial therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Sodium and fluid restriction'</a> above.)</p><p>In the child with nephrotic syndrome, diuretic therapy also should be used sparingly and with great caution. Some affected children, particularly those with severe hypoalbuminemia, may be intravascularly volume depleted. Thus, an aggressive diuresis may lead to further intravascular volume depletion, thereby possibly precipitating acute renal failure and increasing the risk of thrombosis in this already susceptible group of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-edema-in-children/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>Diuretics without albumin administration are not currently recommended in the setting of the childhood nephrotic syndrome. Albumin raises the intravascular oncotic pressure and thereby protects the intravascular compartment against volume contraction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-kidney-injury-aki-in-minimal-change-disease-and-other-forms-of-nephrotic-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute kidney injury (AKI) in minimal change disease and other forms of nephrotic syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=symptomatic-management-of-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Symptomatic management of nephrotic syndrome in children&quot;, section on 'Diuretics'</a>.)</p><p>If diuretics are utilized in patients with either appropriate or depleted intravascular volume, BUN levels should be monitored. In general, a significant decrease in tissue perfusion secondary to excessive diuresis and inadequate mobilization of peripheral edema can be detected simply by an otherwise unexplained rise in the BUN. A stable BUN implies that perfusion to the kidneys (and therefore to other organs) is being well maintained and that the diuresis can be continued if the patient is still edematous.</p><p>Diuretics are usually of little benefit in chronic lymphedema resulting from obstruction, and may promote the development of volume depletion. The reason for this is as follows: When diuretics are given to treat the usual forms of peripheral edema, the initial fluid loss comes from the intravascular space. The ensuing reduction in venous and therefore intracapillary pressure allows the interstitial fluid to be mobilized and the plasma volume to be maintained. However, this sequence does not occur with lymphatic obstruction, as interstitial fluid cannot be mobilized into the vascular space.</p><p>In addition, the use of systemic therapy such as diuretics for a regional problem (lymphedema) will undoubtedly result in untoward effects in unaffected regions of the body, such as effects in the central venous circulation that result in undesirable hemodynamic effects. Therefore, diuretics should not be used in this clinical setting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Intravenous albumin infusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some children with edema secondary to low oncotic pressure may benefit from intravenous albumin infusions in conjunction with loop diuretics.

The first step is a thorough history and physical examination to guide in the diagnosis.</p><p>The focus of the history should include edema location, duration of symptoms, any associated complaints, additional concurrent illnesses or signs, medical and family history, age of edema onset, and a history of allergies and current medications. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p>The focus of the physical examination involves measuring the child's growth parameters, fully evaluating of the cardiovascular system, and characterizing the edema as localized or generalized. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If generalized edema is present, the child should be evaluated for pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, ascites, <span class=\"nowrap\">scrotal/labial</span> edema, or evidence of skin breakdown in regions of edema.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If regional edema is present, the clinician should localize the area of swelling to help deduce where a region of venous or lymphatic obstruction is likely to be present.</p><p/><p>Clues from constellations of symptoms and signs may help suggest the underlying etiology. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clues from constellations of symptoms and signs'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Laboratory testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unless the diagnosis is apparent from the history and physical examination, the following laboratory studies are recommended in the evaluation of a child with edema:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinalysis including a dipstick for proteinuria</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete blood count (CBC)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum chemistries including serum albumin, and renal and liver function tests</p><p/><p>Based upon the results of these tests, the clinical history, physical examination, and urinalysis, additional laboratory tests and imaging studies may be indicated. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most effective therapeutic intervention is to treat the underlying cause. However, general supportive measures can be used as adjunctive therapy or when specific intervention is not available. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sodium restriction is the mainstay of general supportive therapy. The recommended dietary intake is 2 to 3 mEq of sodium per kg weight of the patient (maximum intake 90 mEq [2000 mg] per day). (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Sodium and fluid restriction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diuretic therapy is recommended in patients with increased hydrostatic pressure as a result of increased intravascular volume. It should be used cautiously, if at all, in patients with either reduced or appropriate intravascular volume. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Diuretics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravenous albumin infusions are recommended in a small subset of patients with low intravascular oncotic pressure and significant clinical complications from their edema.
