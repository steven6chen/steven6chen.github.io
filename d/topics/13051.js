In large part, this limitation is related to the lack of a suitable animal model of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Rhesus monkeys develop viremia similar in pattern to humans after dengue virus challenge but do not develop clinical disease. Careful epidemiologic and experimental challenge studies in humans have provided valuable information on dengue virus infection, but detailed data on virus distribution in vivo are available only from small numbers of patients with more severe disease, unusual manifestations, or the later stages of infection. Little pathogenetic information is available concerning milder infections, which constitute the vast majority of cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">THE DENGUE VIRAL REPLICATION CYCLE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dengue viruses are members of the family Flaviviridae genus <em>Flavivirus</em>. They are small, enveloped viruses containing a single-strand RNA genome of positive polarity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Dengue viruses infect a wide range of human and nonhuman cell types in vitro. Viral replication involves the following steps:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attachment to the cell surface</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Entry into the cytoplasm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Translation of viral proteins</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Replication of the viral RNA genome</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Formation of virions (encapsidation)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Release from the cell</p><p/><p>Binding of dengue virions to cells, which is mediated by the major viral envelope (E) glycoprotein, is critical for infectivity. The determination of the three-dimensional structures of the dengue E glycoprotein and the intact virion has facilitated the understanding of this process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Dengue viruses bind via the E glycoprotein to viral receptors on the cell surface, which may include heparan sulfate or lectins such as DC-SIGN and CLEC5A [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]; they can also bind to cell surface immunoglobulin receptors in the presence of antibodies to the E glycoprotein or precursor membrane (pre-M) protein, as described further below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Following fusion of viral and cell membranes in acidified endocytic vesicles, the viral RNA enters the cytoplasm. The viral proteins are then translated directly from the viral RNA as a single polyprotein, which is cleaved to yield the three structural and seven nonstructural proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Cleavage of several of the viral proteins requires a functional viral protease encoded in the nonstructural protein NS3. The nonstructural protein NS5 is the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which assembles with several other viral proteins and several host proteins to form the replication complex. This complex transcribes the viral RNA to produce negative-strand viral RNA, which serves as the template for the production of the viral genomic RNA.</p><p>The assembly and budding of progeny virions is still poorly understood. The pre-M structural protein is cleaved by a cellular enzyme, furin, as one of the final steps in maturation of progeny virions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Cleavage of the pre-M protein enhances the infectivity of the virions 100-fold.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">COURSE OF INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The course of dengue virus infection is characterized by early events, dissemination, and the immune response and subsequent viral clearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F63173\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63173 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Early events</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dengue virus is introduced into the skin when an infected mosquito, most commonly <em>Aedes aegypti</em>, takes a blood meal from a susceptible host. The spread of virus early after subcutaneous injection has been studied in rhesus monkeys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. During the first 24 hours, virus could only be isolated from the injection site. The major cell type infected was not defined; both Langerhans cells and dermal fibroblasts have been proposed to be target cells for dengue virus infection in the skin. One study using human skin dendritic cells demonstrated expression of dengue virus antigens following in vitro exposure, suggesting that these cells are permissive for dengue viral infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In rhesus monkeys, virus was detected in regional lymph nodes 24 hours after infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In one study using a mouse model deficient in both type I and type II interferon (IFN) receptors, macrophages and dendritic cells were demonstrated to be early cellular targets for infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Dissemination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Viremia begins in rhesus monkeys between two and six days after subcutaneous injection and lasts for three to six days. In humans infected with &quot;natural&quot; dengue viruses, viremia begins approximately one day later than in monkeys, but the duration of viremia is similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Viremia is detectable in humans 6 to 18 hours before the onset of symptoms and ends around the time fever resolves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>In rhesus monkeys during the period of viremia, virus was frequently detected in lymph nodes distant from the site of inoculation and less commonly from spleen, thymus, lung, and bone marrow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Virus was also isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes at the end of the viremic period and sometimes for one day after.</p><p>The distribution of virus in humans has been studied in blood, biopsy, and autopsy specimens from patients with natural dengue virus infection. Infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells persists beyond the period of detectable viremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. Conflicting data have been published regarding the principal infected cell type in the peripheral blood. An older study reported more frequent isolation of infectious virus from the adherent cell population than the nonadherent population, suggesting that monocytes are the primary target cell for infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A similar conclusion was reached in a study using flow cytometry, which reported the detection of dengue viral antigen in a very high percentage of circulating monocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, an earlier study using flow cytometry reported that the majority of cell-associated virus was contained in the CD20+ (B lymphocyte) fraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Another study using polymerase chain reaction found the highest levels of dengue viral RNA in B cells but could not exclude passive binding as an explanation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The yield of dengue virus from tissues obtained at autopsy has generally been low. However, in one study using the most sensitive techniques for virus isolation, virus was isolated most often (4 of 16 cases) from liver tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Antigen staining has suggested that the predominant cell types infected are macrophages in the skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] and Kupffer cells in the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]; dengue viral antigens have also been detected in hepatocytes in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Immune response and viral clearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both innate and adaptive immune responses induced by dengue virus infection are likely to play a role in the clearance of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Infection of human cells in vitro induces antiviral responses, including the production of interferons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Consistent with these observations, elevated serum levels of IFN-alpha have been demonstrated in children with dengue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>The role of these cytokine responses is uncertain. Interferon inhibits dengue virus infection in vitro. In addition, dengue virus&ndash;infected cells are susceptible to lysis by natural killer cells in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, dengue viral proteins are able to inhibit both the production of interferons and their antiviral function in infected cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. In one study of host cell gene expression by microarray analysis of blood samples obtained from 14 adults with dengue, a cluster of 24 gene transcripts, many reflecting type I interferon signaling, was identified as significantly less abundant in the six patients with dengue shock syndrome (DSS) than in the eight patients without DSS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. These subjects had low to undetectable plasma viral RNA and IFN-alpha levels when studied. Whether attenuated interferon responses are the result or cause of severe dengue disease is unknown.</p><p>The antibody response to dengue virus infection is primarily directed at serotype-specific determinants, but there is a substantial level of serotype&ndash;cross-reactive antibodies. E, precursor membrane (pre-M), and NS1 are the principal viral proteins that are targeted. In vitro, E protein&ndash;specific antibodies can mediate neutralization of infection, direct complement-mediated lysis or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of dengue virus&ndash;infected cells, and block virus attachment to cell receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Pre-M&ndash;specific antibodies only bind to virions that have not fully matured and have remaining uncleaved pre-M protein. NS1 is not found in the virion; NS1-specific antibodies are therefore incapable of neutralization of virus infection but can direct complement-mediated lysis of infected cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>The basis of neutralization of virus by antibody is not well understood. Neutralization clearly requires a threshold level of antibodies; when the concentration of antibodies is below this threshold, the uptake of antibody-bound virus by cells that express immunoglobulin (Ig) receptors is paradoxically increased, a process termed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. Since monocytes, the putative cellular targets of dengue virus infection in vivo, express immunoglobulin receptors and manifest ADE in vitro, this phenomenon is thought to be highly relevant in natural dengue virus infections (see below). In rhesus monkeys, passive transfer of low levels of dengue-immune human sera or a humanized chimpanzee dengue virus&ndash;specific monoclonal antibody resulted in a 2- to 100-fold increase in dengue-2 or dengue-4 viremia titers as compared with control animals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. An increase in viral titers in blood and tissues and enhanced disease were also observed after passive transfer of low levels of dengue virus&ndash;specific antibody in mice lacking interferon receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Dengue virus entry via ADE has also been found to suppress innate immune responses in infected monocytes in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>One study characterized 301 human dengue virus&ndash;specific monoclonal antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Pre-M&ndash;specific antibodies represented a larger fraction of the monoclonal antibodies detected than antibodies directed at E or NS1. Pre-M&ndash;specific antibodies showed poor neutralization of infection in vitro but could mediate ADE.</p><p>The T lymphocyte response to dengue virus infection also includes both serotype-specific and serotype&ndash;cross-reactive responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Dengue virus&ndash;specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells can lyse dengue virus&ndash;infected cells in vitro and produce cytokines such as IFN-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and lymphotoxin. In vitro, IFN-gamma can inhibit dengue virus infection of monocytes. However, IFN-gamma also enhances the expression of immunoglobulin receptors, which can augment the antibody-dependent enhancement of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary versus secondary infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infection with one of the four serotypes of dengue virus (primary infection) generally provides long-lasting immunity to infection with a virus of the same serotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In contrast, immunity to the other dengue serotypes is transient, and individuals can subsequently be infected with another dengue serotype (secondary infection). Two prospective cohort studies found that the interval between primary and secondary dengue virus infections was significantly longer among children who experienced a symptomatic secondary infection than those who had a subclinical secondary infection, suggesting that heterotypic protective immunity wanes gradually over one to two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].</p><p>In one report, the distribution of dengue virus in secondary infections was evaluated in eight rhesus monkeys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The onset and duration of viremia were similar to primary infections. Autopsy specimens from six monkeys yielded virus somewhat more frequently from various tissues than specimens from primary infections. Another study found higher plasma virus titers in secondary than primary dengue-2 virus infections but not in secondary infections with dengue viruses of the other serotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>There is little information from human studies to allow comparisons of virus distribution or titer in primary and secondary infections. Several studies have reported that higher peak plasma virus titers in secondary dengue infections were associated with more severe illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]. Two studies failed to demonstrate higher viremia titers in patients with secondary dengue infections than in patients with primary dengue infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>], but a study using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction reported higher viral RNA levels in CD14+ monocytes among dengue fever patients with secondary infections compared with dengue fever patients with primary infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The kinetics of dengue virus&ndash;specific antibodies in secondary dengue infections differ from those of primary dengue infections in several ways.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low concentrations of antibodies to the virus serotype causing the secondary infection are present before exposure to the virus. As a result, antibody-dependent enhancement of infection could occur early in secondary dengue virus infections. Consistent with this hypothesis, an analysis of data from a longitudinal cohort study of children in Nicaragua found that the risk of more severe dengue illness was highest within a narrow range of preexisting anti-dengue virus antibody titers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concentrations of dengue virus&ndash;specific antibodies increase earlier in secondary infection, reach higher peak titers, and have a lower IgM:IgG ratio, suggestive of an anamnestic response. Thus, the levels of dengue virus&ndash;specific antibodies are much higher during the late stage of viremia in secondary infections, with greater potential for forming immune complexes of dengue virions and activating complement.</p><p/><p>The kinetics of the T lymphocyte response in secondary infections also would be expected to differ from those of primary infections, with an earlier onset and higher level of dengue virus&ndash;specific T lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production in secondary infections. Studies of circulating T lymphocytes during acute secondary infections have shown a high percentage of cells expressing markers of activation and high frequencies of dengue antigen&ndash;specific cells, consistent with this hypothesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/49-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-52</a>]. However, a study that compared the frequencies of T cells specific for an immunodominant dengue epitope between symptomatic primary and secondary dengue virus infections found no significant differences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>The severity of dengue disease has been correlated with the level and quality of the dengue virus&ndash;specific T lymphocyte responses in some studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>] but not in others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>].</p><p>Some serotype&ndash;cross-reactive T cells present after primary infection display qualitatively altered functional responses to other dengue serotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In one prospective cohort study, specific T cell responses prior to secondary dengue virus infection were associated with the subsequent occurrence of dengue hemorrhagic fever, such as production of TNF-alpha in response to stimulation with dengue antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. In contrast, higher frequencies of CD4+ T cells producing IFN-gamma or interleukin 2 in response to stimulation with dengue antigens were associated with subclinical dengue infection, suggesting a protective effect as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">FACTORS INFLUENCING DISEASE SEVERITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most dengue virus infections produce mild, nonspecific symptoms or classic dengue fever (DF). The more severe manifestations, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS), occur in less than 1 percent of dengue virus infections. Thus, considerable attention has been focused upon understanding the risk factors for DHF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F58587\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58587 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Viral factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DHF can occur during infection with any of the four dengue serotypes; several prospective studies have suggested that the risk is highest with dengue-2 viruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/14,57-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,57-59</a>]. Genetic analyses of dengue virus isolates from the Western hemisphere strongly suggest that DHF only occurs during infection with viruses that fall into specific genotypes within each dengue serotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. These &quot;virulent&quot; genotypes were originally detected in Southeast Asia but are now widespread. Several studies have suggested that &quot;virulent&quot; and &quot;avirulent&quot; genotypes differ in their ability to replicate in monocytic cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>], but it is not clear that this difference in in vitro replication is the factor responsible for virulence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Prior dengue exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple epidemiologic studies have shown that the risk of severe disease (DHF and DSS) is significantly higher during a secondary dengue virus infection than during a primary infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/9,57,64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,57,64,65</a>].</p><p>The increased risk of DHF in secondary dengue virus infections is felt to reflect the differences in immune responses between primary and secondary dengue virus infections described above: antibody-dependent enhancement of infection, enhanced immune complex formation, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> accelerated T lymphocyte responses.</p><p>The increased risk for DHF associated with secondary dengue virus infections appears not to apply to infections with &quot;avirulent&quot; genotypes (see above). A prospective study in Peru found no cases of DHF or DSS during an outbreak of dengue-2 virus infections that was estimated to involve over 49,000 secondary infections in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. At least 880 cases of DHF would have been expected based upon previous studies in Thailand. Furthermore, there are numerous documented cases of DHF occurring during primary infection, suggesting that differences in viral virulence, as discussed above, are also important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/1,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk for DHF appears to decline with age, especially after age 11 years. During the 1981 epidemic of DHF in Cuba, the modal age of DHF cases and deaths was 4 years, although the frequency of secondary dengue-2 infections was similar in those 4 to 40 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>].</p><p>A specific population at higher risk for DHF in endemic areas is infants, particularly those between 6 and 12 months of age. These children acquire dengue virus&ndash;specific antibodies transplacentally and become susceptible to primary dengue virus infection when antibody levels decline below the neutralization threshold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. This observation is taken to support the hypothesis of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection as a primary factor in determining the risk for DHF. A direct correlation between antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) activity of preinfection serum and the severity of infection has not been demonstrated, however [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Nutritional status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some studies have reported that, unlike other infectious diseases, DHF and DSS are less common in malnourished children than in well-nourished children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>], and this has been taken to reflect the role of the immune response in disease pathogenesis.

Racial differences have been described in viral replication in primary monocytes and in the level of dengue serotype&ndash;cross-reactive T cell responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>], but it is unclear if either of these explains the genetic association.</p><p>Genome-wide association studies conducted in Vietnam [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>] and Thailand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>] have found significant genetic associations of two single-nucleotide polymorphisms, one in the major histocompatibility complex class I polypeptide-related sequence B (<em>MICB</em>) gene and one in the phospholipase C epsilon 1 (<em>PLCE1</em>) genes, with both dengue shock syndrome and less severe dengue. The mechanisms for these associations have not been defined.</p><p>In focused studies, DHF has been associated with specific human leukocyte antigen genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/77-80\" class=\"abstract_t\">77-80</a>], with blood group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>], and with polymorphisms of tumor necrosis factor&ndash;alpha, vitamin D, Fc gamma IIa, and DC-SIGN genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/82-84\" class=\"abstract_t\">82-84</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF DISEASE MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Capillary leak syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plasma leakage, due to an increase in capillary permeability, is a cardinal feature of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) but is absent in dengue fever (DF). The enhanced capillary permeability appears to be due to endothelial cell dysfunction rather than injury, as electron microscopy demonstrated a widening of the endothelial tight junctions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. Dengue virus infects human endothelial cells in vitro and causes cellular activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. Additionally, soluble NS1 protein, which can be detected in the serum during acute infection, has been reported to bind to endothelial cells, to activate cells through toll-like receptor 4 signaling, and to serve as a target for antibody binding and complement activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. However, the effects on endothelial cell function during infection are thought more likely to be indirectly caused by dengue virus infection for the following reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Histologic studies show little structural damage to capillaries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection of endothelial cells by dengue virus is not apparent in tissues obtained at autopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased capillary permeability is transient, with rapid resolution and no residual pathology.</p><p/><p>Most investigations have focused on the hypothesis that circulating factors induce the transient increase in capillary permeability. Multiple mediators are likely to be involved in vivo, and interactions between these different factors have been demonstrated in experimental animals. Nitric oxide has been associated with increased vascular permeability and severe dengue in two prospective studies in Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/89,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">89,90</a>]. However, the most important mediators are still thought to include tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interferon (IFN)-gamma, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-8, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and complement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F75407\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75407 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. The sources of these cytokines have been proposed to include virus-infected monocytes, dendritic cells and mast cells, activated platelets, and dengue virus&ndash;specific CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes.</p><p>Elevated serum levels of TNF-alpha, IL-8, IFN-gamma, IL-2, and free VEGF have been observed in patients with DHF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. Other studies have found reduced serum levels of the complement proteins C3 and C5 in patients with DHF, with a corresponding increase in the serum concentrations of anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/92,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">92,93</a>].</p><p>It is difficult to detect elevated cytokine levels in the circulation, because of the short half-life of these molecules. Analysis of more stable markers of immune activation has provided additional, although indirect, support for the immunopathogenesis model of plasma leakage. Several studies have shown that children with DHF have elevated circulating levels of the soluble forms of CD8, CD4, IL-2 receptors, and TNF receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. Increased plasma concentrations of soluble TNF receptor II were found to correlate with the subsequent development of and with the magnitude of plasma leakage into the pleural space. The intensity of the immune response may ultimately be determined by the level of viral replication, however, as one study found that the plasma viremia titer was the strongest independent factor that correlated with plasma leakage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood and bone marrow</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and a hemorrhagic diathesis are the typical hematologic findings in dengue virus infections. Leukopenia is apparent early in illness and is of similar degree in DHF and dengue fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. It is thought to represent a direct effect of dengue virus on the bone marrow. Bone marrow biopsies of children in Thailand with DHF revealed suppression of hematopoiesis early in the illness, with marrow recovery and hypercellularity in the late stage and during early clinical recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. In vitro studies have shown that dengue virus infects human bone marrow stromal cells and hematopoietic progenitor cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/96,97\" class=\"abstract_t\">96,97</a>] and inhibits progenitor cell growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>].</p><p>Some degree of thrombocytopenia is common in both dengue fever and DHF, but marked thrombocytopenia (&lt;100,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">platelets/mm<sup>3</sup>)</span> is one of the criteria used to define DHF. Multiple factors are thought to contribute to the fall in platelet count, which is most severe late in the illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. Bone marrow suppression may play a role, but platelet destruction is probably more important. In one study, 10 of 11 Thai children with DHF had a shortened platelet survival time, ranging from 6.5 to 53 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. Adsorption of dengue virions or virus-antibody immune complexes to the platelet surface, with subsequent activation of complement, are thought to be responsible for the platelet destruction.</p><p>Manifestations of the hemorrhagic diathesis in dengue virus infections range from a positive tourniquet test to life-threatening hemorrhage. Fatal DHF may be associated with diffuse petechial hemorrhages involving the stomach, skin, heart, intestine, and lungs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dengue-virus-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dengue virus infection: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Despite the nomenclature, however, the occurrence of hemorrhage does not define DHF as compared with dengue fever since a positive tourniquet test may occur with equal frequency in the two disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. Several different mechanisms, possibly acting synergistically, contribute to bleeding tendency of dengue virus infections. Both the vasculopathy and thrombocytopenia described above create a predisposition to bleeding.</p><p>Endothelial cell activation and injury and activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis have been reported in dengue, particularly in severe infections. Abnormalities that have been described include increased numbers of circulating endothelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>], elevated levels of von Willebrand factor, tissue factor, tissue plasminogen activator, and platelet activator inhibitor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>], and an increased fractional catabolic rate of fibrinogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. However, most of these findings are based on small studies and comparison with non-dengue controls. Frank coagulopathy is uncommon except in patients with shock.</p><p>A final etiologic factor may be molecular mimicry between dengue viral proteins and coagulation factors. One study of 88 Tahitian children with dengue virus infection found that antibody responses to homologous peptides derived from the dengue virus E protein cross-reacted with plasminogen; these antibodies correlated with the occurrence of hemorrhagic signs (including petechiae) but not with thrombocytopenia or shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. Another study reported that monoclonal antibodies directed at the dengue virus NS1 protein bound in vitro to human fibrinogen, platelets, and endothelial cells and induced hemorrhage in mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Liver</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elevations of serum aminotransferases that are usually mild are common in dengue virus infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. Typical pathologic findings in the livers of fatal cases of dengue include hepatocellular necrosis and Councilman bodies with relatively little inflammatory cell infiltration, similar to the findings in early yellow fever virus infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. The pathologic similarities between these two diseases and the relatively frequent isolation of dengue virus from liver tissues of fatal cases suggest that liver injury is directly mediated by dengue virus infection of hepatocytes and Kupffer cells. Dengue virus has been shown to infect and induce apoptosis in a human hepatoma cell line in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-pathogenesis/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>].
