Determining the optimal pressure settings for PAP in patients with OSA is of paramount importance to help assure patient adherence to therapy and improve important outcomes. However, in the era of multiple available PAP technologies, the clinician should be aware of the methods of titration relevant to each mode of PAP.</p><p>Selecting a titration method to determine the optimal pressure in patients with OSA is discussed in this topic.

The optimal method for PAP titration in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is unknown with no data demonstrating superior outcomes using one titration method compared with another. While an attended in-laboratory PAP titration is the traditional standard and preferred method of determining an effective continuous PAP (CPAP) setting by many clinicians, some insurers in the United States require that patients receive auto-titrating PAP (APAP) without formal in-laboratory PAP titration. Factors that influence this choice include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>OSA-related factors &ndash; The type of OSA is a major factor that determines what method is chosen for PAP titration. (See <a href=\"#H1048117019\" class=\"local\">'Uncomplicated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)'</a> below and <a href=\"#H883135088\" class=\"local\">'Uncomplicated OSA with persistent or new symptoms'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1048117566\" class=\"local\">'Patients with complicated OSA'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non OSA-related factors &ndash; Other factors that influence the decision include the device used for diagnostic testing, the presence or absence of complicating medical conditions, and the values and preferences of the patient (eg, access to a sleep laboratory), the practices of the institution, the preference of the payer in appropriate patients, as well as previous response to PAP therapy (if known). </p><p/><p>The approach described below is<strong> </strong>consistent with the published literature, our practice, and, where appropriate, the <a href=\"http://www.aasmnet.org/practiceparameters.aspx?cid=102&amp;token=TCZoDJKkgSsgDea9026wfO9zkQ/pG/ck8OytXG/pisqrpnTdJ3my00EUB8Wu7WZ9uziOG6lKDPjuJwRis/Mmgg==&amp;TOPIC_ID=99556\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM)</a> practice guidelines for sleep-disordered breathing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mode-selection-for-positive-airway-pressure-titration-in-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].

However, since patients with mild OSA (eg, respiratory events between 5 and 14 per hour) who have symptoms are also frequently offered PAP therapy, a similar approach is appropriate in that population.

While an attended in-laboratory approach is traditionally considered the gold standard, randomized trials and meta-analyses of patients with <strong>uncomplicated</strong> moderate to severe OSA have failed to demonstrate substantial difference in efficacy or adherence between in-laboratory continuous PAP (CPAP) and in-home auto-titrating PAP (APAP) titration strategies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mode-selection-for-positive-airway-pressure-titration-in-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>].

In-laboratory PAP titration has received the most study, and many experts, including contributors of this topic, utilize it as the ideal first-line mode of PAP titration. However, efficacy data also suggest that a trial of in-home auto-titrating CPAP (APAP) may be suitable for this population such that other experts, including contributors of this topic, utilize APAP as an initial strategy provided no contraindications exist and the threshold to perform an in-laboratory study is low when APAP is suspected to be inadequate. Factors that affect this choice are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H1454987556\" class=\"local\">'Choosing in-laboratory CPAP titration or in-home APAP titration'</a> below.)</p><p>Strategies for PAP titration in patients with uncomplicated OSA to determine initial settings for fixed level CPAP and PAP titration for patients with uncomplicated OSA who have persistent or new symptoms following CPAP therapy are discussed in the sections below.

Choosing among these options is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H23383546\" class=\"local\">'Attended in-laboratory CPAP titration'</a> below and <a href=\"#H23383591\" class=\"local\">'Unattended auto-titrating CPAP (APAP)'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1454987556\" class=\"local\">'Choosing in-laboratory CPAP titration or in-home APAP titration'</a> below.)</p><p>Bilevel PAP devices are not typically used as the initial approach to the titration of PAP in patients with uncomplicated OSA.

However, a split-night study may be performed in patients with severe OSA during the initial portion of an attended baseline sleep study, provided there is adequate time (minimum of three hours) to perform a proper PAP titration. Additional details regarding split-night studies are provided separately.

In addition, for patients who cannot access a sleep laboratory, alternate PAP titration modules should be considered.

Auto-titrating positive airway pressure devices utilize proprietary algorithms to resolve obstructive sleep-disordered breathing as detected by the device. They can be used to determine a fixed CPAP setting for patients with uncomplicated OSA, which is discussed in this section [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mode-selection-for-positive-airway-pressure-titration-in-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-15</a>].

However, the optimal method for unattended APAP titration is not clear as many studies have used different approaches to determine a fixed CPAP setting. Variations in APAP titration protocols include different durations of time (eg, 3 to 14 days) using the APAP to determine an optimal pressure, different APAP ranges, and different definitions of trial success. We typically perform 7 to 14 days of APAP titration to determine a starting fixed CPAP pressure. However, in the absence of consensus, shorter or longer periods can also be tried. There is also no consensus on the appropriate initial APAP range, which typically varies from 5 to 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O; the range can be further adjusted based on the presence or absence of symptoms and on data calculated from the device. The optimal fixed CPAP setting is typically the level of pressure at or below which obstructive events measured by the APAP device are eliminated for more than 90 or 95 percent of the time (&quot;P90 and P95 pressure&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mode-selection-for-positive-airway-pressure-titration-in-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/11,13,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13,16</a>]. However, the P90 and P95 can be affected by several factors including nightly adherence to therapy, pressure range settings, and extent of mask leak. Thus, in clinical practice, the P90 and P95 are typically starting points to determining a fixed CPAP setting with empiric adjustments in CPAP settings being required over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mode-selection-for-positive-airway-pressure-titration-in-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13</a>].

Although an attended in-laboratory auto-titration of CPAP is technically feasible, it is only occasionally performed to determine initial settings, or to assess efficacy of auto-titrating CPAP for a given patient. Split-night studies are not practical for unattended in-home settings with auto-titrating devices, as these devices have not been validated for the diagnosis and management of OSA in most patients.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1454987556\"><span class=\"h4\">Choosing in-laboratory CPAP titration or in-home APAP titration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While an attended in-laboratory approach is traditionally considered the gold standard, randomized trials and meta-analyses of patients with <strong>uncomplicated</strong> moderate to severe OSA have failed to demonstrate substantial difference in efficacy or adherence between in-laboratory and in-home APAP titration strategies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mode-selection-for-positive-airway-pressure-titration-in-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>].</p><p>Choosing among these two options in patients with <strong>uncomplicated </strong>OSA varies among sleep clinicians and sleep institutions and is dependent upon a number of factors including medical and practical issues that influence success of the chosen titration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> costs associated with a third party payer. While in-laboratory CPAP titration is ideal, many patients with <strong>uncomplicated</strong> moderate to severe OSA can be considered for an initial trial of APAP titration. Patients with uncomplicated OSA who may be considered for APAP titration include those in whom access to a sleep laboratory is delayed or not feasible, patients prescribed APAP as a therapy (eg, those with risk factors that may vary pressure requirements including fluctuations in weight and use of alcohol), and those in whom cost is prohibitive. In contrast, patients with uncomplicated OSA in whom in-laboratory CPAP titration is the titration mode of choice include those who fail an in-home APAP titration, those who need additional PAP education, and patients who may have medical problems (eg, severe arthritis) or cognitive difficulties (eg, dementia) that may limit in-home titration success. For some patients with severe OSA who have severe nocturnal desaturations and have undergone APAP follow up oximetry is appropriate to ensure that desaturations have been adequately treated. Importantly, for patients with <strong>complicated</strong> OSA (eg, OSA with co-existent COPD, CHF), in-laboratory CPAP titration should be performed. Detailed discussion of the data that support the use of both of these strategies to titrate CPAP in this population and titration in patients with complicated OSA are discussed separately.

Thus, titration with devices that deliver a fixed level of CPAP and BPAP are best suited to this setting. While auto-titrating devices can technically be used in an attended setting, they are more commonly used in an in-home setting, since they collect useful data that can be used to determine the response to positive airway pressure (PAP). PAP titration in the sleep laboratory may be performed on a separate night, following a diagnostic test for OSA, but it can also be performed during the same night the diagnostic test takes place (eg, split-night protocol).

The reasons for this are unclear but may be due to difficulty achieving an optimal setting from the outset or to an inability of a single study to estimate variable pressure needs over a more prolonged period of use.

Although in-laboratory titration is traditionally considered ideal, in practice, choosing among these two options in this population varies among sleep clinicians and sleep institutions. The choice is frequently dependent upon several factors including medical and practical issues that influence success of the chosen titration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> costs associated with a third party payer. Bilevel devices, prediction formulas, or empiric strategies are not typically used to titrate PAP in patients with uncomplicated OSA.
