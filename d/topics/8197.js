These defects impair the elastic deformability that is essential to the normal RBC lifespan, and they are responsible for the spherocytic (rather than biconcave disc) shape of HS RBCs.

No abnormality was detected in 15 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 1996 study that evaluated 46 HS families using DNA-based methods (sequencing of coding and promotor regions) of <em>ANK1 </em>(gene for ankyrin) and <em>SLC4A1</em> (gene for band 3) found mutations in <em>ANK1</em> to be more common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p>Defects in band 4.1, encoded by the <em>EPB41</em> gene, have not been reported in HS, although they are known to cause hereditary elliptocytosis (HE). Defects in the Rh-associated glycoprotein, encoded by the <em>RHAG</em> gene, cause hereditary stomatocytosis.</p><p>The studies that have evaluated specific gene mutations have generally found that pathogenic mutations in these genes tend to be distributed throughout the gene rather than localized to specific &quot;hotspots&quot;; this is illustrated in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F55451\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55451 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p>Most (approximately three-fourths) of HS mutations act in an autosomal dominant fashion (ie, a single mutant allele is sufficient to confer disease). This includes mutations in <em>SPTB</em>, <em>ANK1</em>, <em>SLC4A1</em>,<em> </em>and <em>EPB42</em>. However, autosomal recessive transmission also occurs, particularly with <em>SPTA1 </em>and <em>EPB42</em> mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. De novo mutations are often described, although the relative frequency has not been determined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/8-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-13</a>].</p><p>The roles of these mutations in causing spherocytosis has been studied in several genetically engineered animal models (eg, transgenic mice) and in naturally occurring mutations in mice and cattle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>]. In the neonatal anemia (Nan) mouse, mutation of another gene that encodes the transcription factor <em>KLF1</em> results in deficiencies of multiple membrane proteins (alpha spectrin, beta spectrin, ankyrin, band 3, and band 4.1) and clinical features of HS (spherocytic anemia), but abnormalities of <em>KLF1</em> have not been reported in patients with HS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>Additional information about the assembly of these proteins is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-membrane-structure-organization-and-dynamics#H1830324319\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell membrane: Structure, organization, and dynamics&quot;, section on 'Composition of the membrane/cytoskeleton'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2322072687\"><span class=\"h3\">Ankyrin and spectrin deficiencies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ankyrin is the major protein responsible for the mechanical coupling between the RBC plasma membrane and the underlying cytoskeleton. Spectrin is a flexible, rod-like protein that binds ankyrin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F79183\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79183 \">figure 2</a>). Spectrin maintains the composition of other proteins and lipids in the RBC membrane, confers the biconcave disc shape of the cell, and allows RBCs to undergo reversible deformations without alterations in surface area as they traverse the microvasculature.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When ankyrin deficiency is accompanied by spectrin deficiency, the usual cause is an <em>ANK1</em> mutation with secondary loss of spectrin from the RBC membrane due to reduced incorporation of spectrin into the membrane; this occurs because ankyrin is the principal binding site for spectrin in the membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Over 60 ankyrin mutations have been described, most of them private (ie, found in only a single kindred) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><em>ANK1</em> mutations typically act in an autosomal dominant fashion, but autosomal recessive presentations have also been reported. One study found that missense mutations in the coding region and a mutation in the promotor region were typically associated with recessive HS, whereas frameshift and nonsense mutations were more likely to cause autosomal dominant HS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Another study found a frameshift mutation, designated Ankyrin Florian&oacute;polis, in three independent families with severe autosomal dominant HS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Patients with a deletion of the short arm of chromosome 8, which contains the <em>ANK1</em> gene, have been described; these individuals have HS, intellectual disability, and other congenital anomalies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A smaller proportion of cases of isolated spectrin deficiency may be caused by mutations affecting the <em>SPTA1</em> or <em>SPTB</em> genes, which encode alpha and beta spectrin, respectively. In cases caused by spectrin mutations, beta spectrin (<em>SPTB</em>) mutations tend to act in an autosomal dominant fashion and alpha spectrin (<em>SPTA1</em>) mutations tend to act in an autosomal recessive fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/24-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-32</a>]. This is because beta spectrin is rate limiting for assembly of the alpha-beta tetramer, whereas alpha spectrin is synthesized in excess. However, missense mutations affecting beta spectrin with autosomal recessive inheritance have also been reported; these are presumed to have a milder clinical presentation because they do not completely abolish beta spectrin production.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some individuals may have more severe disease when an HS spectrin mutation is inherited together with a low-expression alpha spectrin allele such as alpha-spectrin Bughill, alpha spectrin Lepra, or possibly alpha spectrin low-expression Lyon (Lely) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/31,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,33</a>]. These alpha spectrin alleles are discussed separately.

It provides cohesion between the RBC plasma membrane and the underlying cytoskeletal proteins, preventing membrane surface loss, and it exchanges bicarbonate for chloride ions, maintaining RBC water content and preventing cellular dehydration.</p><p>S<em>LC4A1</em> mutations typically act in an autosomal dominant fashion and typically cause mild, compensated hemolytic anemia. Documented pathogenic variants include frameshift, missense, splicing, or nonsense mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/3,5,34-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,34-39</a>]. Hemolysis may be aggravated by compound heterozygosity for pathogenic <em>SLC4A1 </em>mutation plus a low-expression band 3 allele [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].</p><p><em>SLC4A1</em> mutations can also cause secondary band 4.2 deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

The typical patient with band 4.2 deficiency is of Japanese ancestry with an autosomal recessive transmission of an <em>EBP42</em> mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. A number of missense and splicing mutations have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/50-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-54</a>]. Other cases of band 4.2 deficiency may be secondary to a mutation in S<em>LC4A1</em> (encodes band 3) that alters the stability of the band 4.2 protein <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> its interactions with the cytoskeleton [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/55-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-59</a>].</p><p>As noted above, deficiencies of band 4.2 are rare causes of HS. (See <a href=\"#H56136727\" class=\"local\">'Overview of mutations'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4028347511\"><span class=\"h2\">Changes in the RBC membrane</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, most of the pathogenic HS variants reduce the level of one or more RBC membrane proteins that link the cytoskeleton to the overlying plasma membrane. It is also possible for HS variants to affect protein-protein binding rather than protein abundance. (See <a href=\"#H3833308762\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above.)</p><p>Studies from animal models suggest that one of the mechanisms of secondary cytoskeletal protein deficiencies involves aberrant sorting of these proteins during the enucleation stage of RBC maturation (ie, when the nucleus is extruded, certain proteins are expelled with the extruded cell nucleus) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>The loss of these proteins results in reduced vertical associations between the cytoskeleton and membrane, which in turn leads to microvesiculation and progressive membrane loss, the central abnormality that defines HS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/61-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-63</a>]. Loss of membrane reduces the ratio of RBC surface area to volume, in turn creating progressively more spherical cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70611\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70611 \">picture 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-membrane-structure-organization-and-dynamics#H3991963788\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell membrane: Structure, organization, and dynamics&quot;, section on 'Surface area to volume ratio (SA/V)'</a>.)</p><p>There is evidence that membrane loss is present as early as the reticulocyte stage; this distinguishes HS from acquired, autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), in which only mature RBCs become spherocytic due to membrane loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>Two hypotheses have been advanced to explain how deficiencies or qualitative defects in these membrane proteins lead to vesiculation and membrane loss. In the first, spectrin deficiency acts directly on the bilayer to create areas of weakness that allow membrane loss. In the second, band 3 deficiency or dispersion causes vesiculation by reducing the integrity of the lipid bilayer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p>Some individuals with HS have abnormal RBC ion transport, the severity of which may depend on the degree of band 3 deficiency (band 3 is the anion transporter) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. On the other hand, all spherocytes demonstrate increased passive permeability to monovalent cations (sodium and potassium) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of red blood cell hydration&quot;, section on 'Passive gradient-driven systems'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1623571274\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanisms of hemolysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spherocytes are prone to hemolysis. The mechanisms include reduced deformability, which impairs passage through constricted regions of the microcirculation, and phagocytosis by splenic macrophages, which occurs in response to splenic trapping. Loss of spectrin appears to be especially correlated with the severity of hemolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p>Once RBCs become spherocytic, successive phagocytosis during repeated passages through the splenic cords (a process termed splenic conditioning) promotes further membrane loss and a progressively more spheroidal shape (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70611\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70611 \">picture 2</a>). This in turn further impairs passage through the narrow fenestrations of the splenic cords [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>]. In severe cases, reduced membrane stability may contribute to mechanical RBC destruction.</p><p>In addition to phagocytosis, the spleen also exposes RBCs to an acidotic, oxidizing, metabolically unfavorable environment. RBCs may also become depleted of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG; previously called 2,3-diphosphoglycerate [2,3-DPG]), and in certain cases, there may be methylation of membrane proteins (in spectrin deficiency but not in band 3 deficiency) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p>Case reports have described individuals with the same familial mutation who have different severities of hemolysis (ie, variable clinical penetrance). In some cases, this variability has been due to concomitant mutations in other genes that affect RBC function. As an example, in a family with mild autosomal dominant HS due to partial band 3 deficiency, one family member had more severe clinical features than others, and this was attributed to an exacerbating effect of a pyruvate kinase (PK) gene (<em>PKLR</em>) mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. It was speculated that low ATP levels from his partial PK deficiency increased the osmotic fragility of his RBCs.</p><p>As discussed below, splenectomy virtually eliminates hemolysis and anemia in moderately severe cases of HS and partially corrects the anemia in severe cases. However, it has been reported that splenectomy is more effective in reducing hemolysis when HS is due to <span class=\"nowrap\">spectrin/ankyrin</span> deficiency than when HS is due to band 3 deficiency, perhaps due to different degrees of reticuloendothelial clearance as a mechanism of hemolysis in different individuals. Elegant studies have demonstrated that this may be related to greater opsonization (binding of naturally occurring antibodies) with <span class=\"nowrap\">spectrin/ankyrin-deficient</span> RBCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. The role of splenectomy in HS management is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Splenectomy'</a> below.)</p><p>Hemolysis may transiently lessen if an individual with HS develops obstructive jaundice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. This is thought to be because transient hepatic obstruction produces an abnormal plasma lipid profile that increases RBC membrane surface area and partially corrects the reduced surface area to volume <span class=\"nowrap\">(SA/V)</span> ratio characteristic of spherocytes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-membrane-structure-organization-and-dynamics#H3991963788\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell membrane: Structure, organization, and dynamics&quot;, section on 'Surface area to volume ratio (SA/V)'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15480082\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HS is seen in all populations but appears to be especially common in people of northern European ancestry.

However, anemia can develop after several days, and is most likely to be severe during the second or third week of life. Some infants require chronic transfusions during the first year; however, transfusion dependence beyond the first year of life is unusual. Red blood cell (RBC) indices are described below.

A commonly cited cause of transient aplastic crisis is parvovirus B19 infection; other viral or bacterial infections may also cause transient aplasia. This is because individuals with chronic hemolysis are highly dependent on the accelerated production of new RBCs by the bone marrow, and they can experience a rapid drop in hemoglobin level when the bone marrow is unable to compensate for hemolysis.

The mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) is often the most useful parameter for assessing spherocytosis; an MCHC &ge;36 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> is consistent with spherocytes.

Spherocytes on the blood smear are helpful if present, but up to one-third of neonates with HS do not have prominent spherocytes, and some neonates without HS have spherocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].</p><p>It may be difficult to assess spherocytes on the peripheral blood smear in a neonate, either because neonates with HS may have fewer spherocytes or because spherocytic cells are often present after birth in neonates without HS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>].

EMA (eosin-5-maleimide) is an eosin-based fluorescent dye that binds to RBC membrane proteins, especially band 3 and Rh-related proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. The mean fluorescence of EMA-labeled RBCs from individuals with HS is lower than controls, and this reduction in fluorescence can be detected in a flow cytometry-based assay. Two case series of individuals with HS have found the EMA fluorescence in individuals with HS to be approximately two-thirds that of controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/97,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,98</a>]. Samples can be stored and tested; one of the studies also analyzed the effect of delayed testing and found that samples stored for 24 hours in the darkness gave similar results to those tested immediately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Advantages of EMA binding include its high sensitivity and specificity; rapid turnaround time (approximately two hours); and need for only a minimal amount of blood (a few microliters), which is especially advantageous for testing neonates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/99-101\" class=\"abstract_t\">99-101</a>]. In addition, EMA testing can be used to identify HS in a patient who has recently received a transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. In various studies, the sensitivity and specificity of the test appear to be in the ranges of 93 to 96 and 93 to 99 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/99,103-105\" class=\"abstract_t\">99,103-105</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">EMA binding may also be positive in some forms of hereditary elliptocytosis (HE; eg, hereditary pyropoikilocytosis [HPP] and Southeast Asian ovalocytosis [SAO]), in individuals with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA) type II, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> in autoimmune hemolytic anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/98,103\" class=\"abstract_t\">98,103</a>].

In this test, RBCs are incubated in hypotonic buffered salt solutions of various osmolarities, and the fraction of hemoglobin released (due to hemolysis) is measured.

The usual course of parvovirus-associated anemia is spontaneous resolution within a few days or weeks. Infected individuals are monitored with twice-weekly complete blood counts (CBCs) and reticulocyte counts to determine the expected hemoglobin nadir and the need for transfusion.

Typically, this can be discontinued around the age of nine months.

Of the 46 who did not undergo concomitant cholecystectomy, 16 (35 percent) developed gallstones, typically several years after splenectomy. There were no severe infections requiring hospitalization and no thrombotic complications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two reports from 2015 and 2016 described outcomes in a consortium registry of patients with a variety of congenital hemolytic anemias (Splenectomy in Congenital Hemolytic Anemia [SICHA]) that included 61 children and adolescents with HS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/119,120\" class=\"abstract_t\">119,120</a>]. Procedures were evenly divided between total and partial splenectomy; most were performed laparoscopically. Hemoglobin increased in all of the children with HS (mean increase, 4.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL;</span> greater increases with total than partial splenectomy), and transfusion dependence in the group as a whole decreased from 22 to 4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2001 series of 48 individuals with HS reported that those who had undergone splenectomy had a mean hemoglobin of approximately 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> and those who had not undergone splenectomy had a mean hemoglobin of approximately 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F54945\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54945 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p/><p>Additional smaller series have reported similar findings, although some have observed more concerning complications such as post-splenectomy sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/121-126\" class=\"abstract_t\">121-126</a>].</p><p>In our experience, the typical post-splenectomy course includes an increase in hemoglobin, a decrease in reticulocyte count, and a decrease in serum bilirubin levels, all of which occur over the course of several days. Often, the hemoglobin and bilirubin become normal or near normal, although RBC survival remains shorter than normal and the reticulocyte count may remain mildly elevated. In individuals with severe disease, the risk of life-threatening anemia and the need for regular transfusions is often eliminated, although some degree of anemia may persist; adverse effects on growth and development and pain due to splenomegaly will also be ameliorated. This is consistent with observations published by other experts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/80,114,115,127\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,114,115,127</a>]. The likelihood of requiring cholecystectomy for gallstone disease may also be reduced, as noted above; however, reducing the need for cholecystectomy is rarely an indication for splenectomy.</p><p>In patients for whom splenectomy is appropriate but surgery is refused or contraindicated, partial splenic embolization has been employed, with anecdotal reports of success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/128\" class=\"abstract_t\">128</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H721792272\"><span class=\"h3\">Pre-splenectomy considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For individuals considering splenectomy (total or partial), it is prudent to ensure that all immunizations for encapsulated organisms have been administered with sufficient time to develop an antibody response (typically approximately two weeks before the surgery). For children two years or older who have received all recommended routine vaccinations, the following is appropriate:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pneumococcal disease</strong> &ndash; If standard four doses of PCV13 have not previously been administered, one or two doses should be given to complete the series.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of sepsis in the asplenic patient&quot;, section on 'Immunizations'</a>.)</p><p>For individuals with gallstones, it may be advantageous to perform simultaneous cholecystectomy at the time of splenectomy. This decision takes into account the size and symptoms of the stones as well as other operative factors. The use of cholecystectomy in individuals with asymptomatic gallstones is controversial; patient values and preferences should be factored into this decision. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-incidental-gallstones\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with incidental gallstones&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As noted separately, it is important to confirm that the diagnosis is HS rather than another inherited hemolytic anemia such as hereditary stomatocytosis (HSt), for which outcomes with splenectomy are considerably worse.

If not removed, an accessory spleen may grow and result in the recurrence of symptomatic anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/129\" class=\"abstract_t\">129</a>].</p><p>However, laparoscopic splenectomy is increasingly used by surgeons with expertise in this technique. There are no randomized trials comparing open versus laparoscopic splenectomy in HS; however, observational studies in broader pediatric populations and case series have observed that, when performed properly, laparoscopic splenectomy is associated with lower complication rates and shorter hospital stays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/130-135\" class=\"abstract_t\">130-135</a>]. Laparoscopic splenectomy appears to be equally effective in locating and removing an accessory spleen if present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/133\" class=\"abstract_t\">133</a>]. Thus, laparoscopic splenectomy is used when there is appropriate institutional and surgical expertise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. In rare cases with a very large spleen, it may be necessary to extend the incision.</p><p>For younger children who cannot delay splenectomy until after six years of age, we suggest partial splenectomy (also called subtotal or near-total splenectomy). There are no randomized trials comparing partial splenectomy with total splenectomy in HS, and the decision between total and partial splenectomy is made on a case-by-case basis. Compared with total splenectomy, partial splenectomy is likely to be effective in reducing hemolysis while maintaining splenic immune function, although it is probably less effective than total splenectomy in reducing hemolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/121,122,136-144\" class=\"abstract_t\">121,122,136-144</a>].</p><p>Following partial splenectomy, the spleen eventually regrows and regains part or all of its previous size, and a second (complete) splenectomy may be required. In many cases, this is performed at a time when the patient is considerably older, with a reduced risk of sepsis. Some individuals who undergo near-total splenectomy may have less regrowth of the splenic remnant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/139\" class=\"abstract_t\">139</a>]. <span class=\"nowrap\">Partial/subtotal</span> splenectomy should be accompanied by all of the precautions regarding potential sepsis risk (eg, vaccinations, antibiotics) in case of secondary necrosis of the splenic remnant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/136\" class=\"abstract_t\">136</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Splenectomy has a number of known risks of which patients (or parents) should be aware [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Operative risks (eg, infection, bleeding, or injury to adjacent organs such as the stomach or tail of the pancreas); these are relatively infrequent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infections, including overwhelming sepsis, from encapsulated organisms (eg, <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, H. influenzae</em>) that can no longer be removed by normal splenic clearance mechanisms, as well as certain other microorganisms including plasmodia, <em>Babesia</em>,<em> Bordetella</em>, and <em>Capnocytophaga</em> species (from animal bites) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>].

Four deaths from sepsis occurred 2, 18, 23, and 30 years after splenectomy, and the estimated mortality from overwhelming sepsis was 0.73 per 1000 patient-years. The mortality rates for the 35 children who underwent splenectomy prior to six years of age and for the 191 individuals who underwent splenectomy at an older age were 1.12 and 0.66 per 1000 years, respectively, both of which were far higher than those seen in the general population.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A 1999 review of 264 children who underwent splenectomy at a single medical center reported that 10 (3.8 percent) developed post-splenectomy sepsis within a mean period of two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-spherocytosis/abstract/147\" class=\"abstract_t\">147</a>]. Nine of the 10 episodes occurred in patients whose surgery was performed between the ages of zero and five years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, risks of sepsis are likely to have declined with improved options for preoperative vaccinations and postoperative prophylactic penicillin.

These abnormalities decrease the levels of proteins that link the RBC inner membrane skeleton to the outer lipid bilayer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F79183\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79183 \">figure 2</a>), which in turn leads to membrane vesiculation, progressive spherocyte formation, and hemolysis. Approximately three-fourths of these variants act in an autosomal dominant manner, with the remainder autosomal recessive. (See <a href=\"#H4155002310\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HS is seen in all populations but appears to be especially common in people of northern European ancestry. In these individuals, HS affects as many as 1 in 2000 to 1 in 5000 (prevalence, approximately 0.02 to 0.05 percent). HS may account for as many as 1 percent of infants with neonatal jaundice. (See <a href=\"#H15480082\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HS can present at any age and with any severity. The majority of affected individuals have mild or moderate hemolytic anemia. Neonates with HS often present with jaundice and hyperbilirubinemia; the serum bilirubin level may not peak until several days after birth. In older children and adults, the presentation may be that of an incidental finding of hemolytic anemia or spherocytes on the blood smear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70611\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70611 \">picture 2</a>), or the individual may be symptomatic from anemia, splenomegaly, or pigment gallstones. Exacerbations of anemia may occur in certain settings such as parvovirus infection, mononucleosis, or pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All individuals suspected of having HS based on a known family history <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> clinical findings should have complete blood count (CBC) with reticulocyte count and RBC indices, review of the blood smear by an experienced individual, testing for hemolysis, and Coombs testing. In neonates or infants, a mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) &ge;36 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> is highly suggestive of HS. Spherocytes and reticulocytosis are less reliable indicators in infants but are important in older children and adults. (See <a href=\"#H11594793\" class=\"local\">'Initial testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of tests are available for confirming the diagnosis of HS in individuals in whom the disorder is suspected based on the history, examination, and results of initial laboratory testing. Of these, EMA (eosin-5-maleimide) binding is our preferred test because of its high sensitivity and specificity. Other options include osmotic fragility, glycerol lysis and modifications (acidified glycerol lysis, pink test), and cryohemolysis. In atypical cases, two tests can be combined, and if the diagnosis remains in question, DNA testing can be performed. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Confirmatory tests'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2584322989\" class=\"local\">'Specialized testing for selected cases'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3487876878\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of HS includes a number of other hemolytic anemias with spherocytes on the blood smear. Other inherited RBC membrane disorders include hereditary elliptocytosis (HE) and hereditary stomatocytosis (HSt). Other possible diagnoses in neonates include hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN), infantile pyknocytosis, and congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA) type II. Other possible diagnoses in adults include autoimmune or drug-induced hemolytic anemias. (See <a href=\"#H15480232\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of HS is directed at minimizing complications of chronic hemolysis and anemia. Neonates may require therapy for hyperbilirubinemia and in severe cases, transfusion or even exchange transfusion. Erythropoietin may be used in some infants to reduce transfusion requirements. For those with moderate to severe hemolysis, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> supplementation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>); a typical dose is 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. Pregnant women with HS require higher doses of folic acid, as presented separately.

For children who are under six years of age, we suggest partial rather than total splenectomy (provided there is adequate surgical expertise) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>); total splenectomy, if necessary, can be delayed until after the age of six years to reduce the risk of sepsis. Some children closer to six years may reasonably elect to have a total splenectomy rather than partial splenectomy as the initial procedure. Observational data demonstrate a dramatic reduction in transfusion requirements after splenectomy. The use of splenectomy in individuals with moderate disease is individualized based on symptoms (eg, discomfort from splenomegaly, distress from jaundice).

Patients should be aware of different operative techniques available (partial versus total splenectomy; open versus laparoscopic procedures) and potential complications of splenectomy, which include potentially life-threatening sepsis, venous thromboembolism (VTE), and possibly arterial thromboembolic events or pulmonary hypertension. It is important to confirm that the patient does not have HSt, for which outcomes with splenectomy are considerably worse.
