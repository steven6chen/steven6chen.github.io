It is one of three disorders within the exstrophy-epispadias complex.</p><p>The diagnosis, clinical features, and initial management of bladder exstrophy are reviewed here. The surgical management and postoperative care of children with bladder exstrophy are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-and-postoperative-outcome-of-children-with-bladder-exstrophy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management and postoperative outcome of children with bladder exstrophy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EXSTROPHY-EPISPADIAS COMPLEX</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The exstrophy-epispadias complex (EEC) encompasses the following congenital anomalies, including bladder exstrophy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epispadias, the least severe defect of the group, is characterized by failure of the urethra to close normally, and as a result, the inner lining of the urethra lays flat and exposed on the dorsal (top) surface of the penis. Patients with bladder exstrophy will also have epispadias. However, isolated epispadias is less common than classical bladder exstrophy and is diagnosed in 1 in 200,000 to 400,000 live births.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bladder exstrophy is classically characterized by an open, inside-out bladder (the inner surface exposed) on the surface of the lower abdominal wall and an open exposed dorsal urethra (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73750\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73750 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53828\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53828 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59654\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59654 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58943\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58943 \">picture 3</a>). Bladder exstrophy usually involves several organ systems in the body, including the urinary tract, the reproductive tract, the digestive system, the muscles and the skin of the lower abdominal wall, and the muscles and bones of the pelvis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cloacal exstrophy, the most severe defect, is classically characterized by exstrophy of the urinary bladder and large intestine (hindgut) through an abdominal wall defect, anal atresia, hypoplasia of the colon, omphalocele, and anomalous genitalia. In some cases, there may also be hypoplasia of the small intestine. The pelvic bone abnormalities are typically more pronounced in cloacal exstrophy relative to bladder exstrophy. The vertebral column (backbone) and spinal cord are also often abnormally developed. Individuals with cloacal exstrophy require evaluation and management by orthopedic and neurosurgery specialists. There may also be associated abnormalities of one or both kidneys such as impaired development, abnormal function or position, or absence of a kidney. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=body-stalk-anomaly-and-cloacal-exstrophy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Body stalk anomaly and cloacal exstrophy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of bladder exstrophy appears to be due to an embryological defect in abdominal wall development. The most universally accepted theory proposed by Marshall and Muecke is that lower abdominal wall development is disrupted by the overdevelopment of the cloacal membrane, which prevents medial migration of the mesenchymal tissue towards the midline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-infants-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The subsequent rupture of the cloacal membrane results in herniation of the lower abdominal components to the surface of the lower abdominal wall and the characteristic features of the exstrophy-epispadias complex. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Exstrophy-epispadias complex'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reported incidence of bladder exstrophy ranges from 3 to 5 per 100,000 live births (ie, 1 per 20,000 to 33,000 live births) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-infants-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. It occurs more often in males than females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-infants-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/2,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,5</a>], and is more frequent in firstborn children, as well as in white compared with nonwhite infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-infants-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. There appears to be a genetic predisposition, as the risk of bladder exstrophy increases in offspring of affected individuals to 1 in 70 live births, approximately a 500-fold greater incidence than the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-infants-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with classic bladder exstrophy typically have a constellation of findings that affect the bladder, abdominal wall, pelvic bones, anus, and genitalia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73750\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73750 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53828\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53828 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59654\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59654 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58943\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58943 \">picture 3</a>). In most cases, bladder exstrophy is an isolated anomaly to the bladder and pelvis without other associated malformations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-infants-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>These include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Open bladder plate and exposed urethra through its entire length &ndash; The triangular defect caused by the premature rupture of the abnormal cloacal membrane contains the exstrophied bladder and exposed urethra.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low set umbilicus &ndash; The umbilicus lies just above the apex of the defect (at the uppermost extent of the exposed bladder) in a more caudal position than normal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diastasis of the symphysis pubis &ndash; Diastasis of the symphysis pubis is caused by outward malrotation of the pelvic bones, more specifically the innominate bones (ilium, ischium, and pubis) that form the acetabulum. This results in the widening or separation of the pubic bones from the anterior midline (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55640\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef55640 \">image 1</a>). Other findings include an increased distance between the hips and outward rotation of the acetabula and lower limbs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-infants-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In one study, computerized tomography demonstrated greater external rotation of both the iliac wing angle and sacroiliac joint angle in children with bladder exstrophy compared with age and gender-matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-infants-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Other findings included a greater mean pubic diastasis (4.2 versus 0.6 cm) and an increase in inferior rotation in patients with bladder exstrophy compared with controls. These deformities, if not corrected, may result in an abnormal gait in affected children. Infants with classic bladder exstrophy are also at risk for hip dysplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-infants-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Developmental dysplasia of the hip: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anteriorly displaced anus &ndash; The perineum is short and broad with displacement of the anus anteriorly, directly behind the urogenital diaphragm, which demarcates the posterior limit of the triangular fascial defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-infants-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The anterior anal displacement and associated abnormalities in the pelvic floor musculature may predispose patients with bladder exstrophy to fecal incontinence and rectal prolapse, and are important considerations for surgical correction. However, surgical reconstruction of this component of the anatomical defects present in bladder exstrophy is usually unnecessary.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inguinal hernia &ndash; Inguinal hernias are common in patients with bladder exstrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-infants-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/4,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genitalia &ndash; Although genitalia defects occur in both sexes, defects are generally more severe and complex in affected males.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Males &ndash; In affected males, clinical features include epispadias with the urethral opening along the dorsal (top) surface aspect of the penis, dorsal (upward) curvature with absent dorsal foreskin, and an open prostate gland, which does not encircle the urethra but lies posterior to it (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53828\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53828 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59654\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59654 \">picture 2</a>). The penis is shortened because of marked deficiency of anterior corpora cavernosa tissue and the diastasis of the symphysis pubis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75574\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75574 \">figure 2</a>). Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrates shorter anterior corporal (erectile <span class=\"nowrap\">body/tissue)</span> length in both neonatal and adult male patients with bladder exstrophy compared with normal controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-infants-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Females &ndash; Affected females have epispadias with a bifid clitoris and small, laterally displaced labia minora (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73750\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73750 \">picture 1</a>).The vagina, which is of otherwise normal caliber, is shortened compared with normals. In the sexually active mature female, vaginal dilation may occasionally be required to allow satisfactory sexual intercourse. The fallopian tubes and ovaries are generally normal. Female patients may be predisposed to the development of uterine prolapse, which may require corrective surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-infants-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Variants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are also rare variants of the classic bladder exstrophy that include the following findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Superior vesical fissure &ndash; These patients have the typical muscular and skeletal defects of classic bladder exstrophy, but only the upper (cephalad) portion of the bladder is affected. The urethra may be intact.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pseudoexstrophy &ndash; These patients have the typical muscular and skeletal defects of classic bladder exstrophy but do not have any urinary tract abnormality (ie, intact normal urinary system).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duplicate exstrophy &ndash; These patients have a duplicated lower urinary tract, which includes one closed system and one open system with an exposed bladder and urethra on the surface of the lower abdominal wall, anterior to the inner closed bladder.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Covered exstrophy &ndash; These patients have the typical muscular and skeletal defects of classic bladder exstrophy with only a skin covering over the bladder and urethra.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Often the diagnosis of bladder exstrophy is made by prenatal ultrasound and, in some cases, may be confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In the event that a prenatal diagnosis is not made, the diagnosis should be clinically apparent and recognizable at birth in the delivery room. In our center, 43 percent of patients who presented from 1996 to 2004 were diagnosed prenatally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-infants-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Prenatal ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a review of 40 prenatal US examinations performed in 25 pregnancies in which the offspring had classic bladder exstrophy, the following findings were consistent with the prenatal diagnosis of bladder exstrophy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64600\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64600 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-infants-with-bladder-exstrophy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of bladder filling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low-set umbilicus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pubic bone diastasis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diminutive genitalia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower abdominal mass that increases in size as the pregnancy progresses and as the intraabdominal viscera increase in size.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Delivery room</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a prenatal diagnosis is not made, the diagnosis of bladder exstrophy should be clinically recognizable at delivery. A careful physical examination will differentiate bladder exstrophy from other congenital anomalies that involve abdominal wall defects, such as omphalocele, gastroschisis, and cloacal exstrophy.</p><p>Important features of the initial physical examination include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Size of the bladder template &ndash; The size of the bladder template may affect the timing of surgical closure. Patients with a small bladder plate may have delayed reconstruction in order to allow further growth of the bladder to facilitate successful bladder closure. However, other factors, such as surgeon and institutional preference, affect timing of initial surgery (within 48 to 72 hours after birth versus 6 to 12 weeks of life).

In boys with bladder exstrophy, the testes may appear to be undescended in their course from the widened pubic tubercles to the flat, wide scrotum. However, most males with bladder exstrophy do not have cryptorchidism and do not require orchiopexy.

However, omphalocele (protruding, covered intraabdominal organs) may occasionally be associated with bladder exstrophy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=body-stalk-anomaly-and-cloacal-exstrophy#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Body stalk anomaly and cloacal exstrophy&quot;, section on 'Cloacal exstrophy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Position of the anus &ndash; The anus is usually displaced anteriorly, which may have important clinical implications for urinary and fecal continence, pelvic organ prolapse, and surgical reconstruction. However, surgical revision of the anus is generally uncommon.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Degree of pubic symphysis diastasis and malleability of the pelvis &ndash; The need for pelvic osteotomy at the time of bladder closure is dependent upon the severity of these two features.

We prefer using transparent adhesive dressing because it adheres to the intact skin immediately surrounding the exposed bladder and provides protection of the bladder by covering without sticking to the surfaces of the bladder and urethra and prevents diaper abrasion. It also allows egress of urine along the scrotum in boys and the genitalia in girls, and prevents irritation to the exposed bladder and urethra from abrasive diapers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The bladder may be irrigated intermittently with sterile saline during diaper changes, although this is not absolutely necessary. The bladder may be submersed in water for a tub bath.

Suggested measures include replacement of the plastic clamp routinely used to occlude the umbilical cord with a soft silk ligature or umbilical tape, and covering the bladder with transparent adhesive dressing that adheres to the intact skin immediately surrounding the exposed bladder and urethra to protect against diaper abrasion, or if this is unavailable, soft plastic wrap.
