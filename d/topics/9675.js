If there is a significant rise in the neutrophil count within 24 hours of the glucocorticoid dose, there must be neutrophils in the marrow. However, if the neutropenia is the presentation of lymphoblastic leukemia, such a challenge may delay diagnosis. Thus, we would not recommend using a glucocorticoid challenge because of the possibility of obscuring the diagnosis of lymphoid leukemia or lymphoma. A dose of 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) will release neutrophils within 12 to 24 hours of injection if the marrow reserve pool is replete. It is not clear that absence of a response to either of these challenges means the marrow is empty. &#160;</p><p>Specific findings that may be helpful include the bone marrow cellularity, presence of an arrest at a specific stage of neutrophil maturation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=regulation-of-myelopoiesis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Regulation of myelopoiesis&quot;, section on 'Neutrophil production and maturation'</a>), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abnormalities of myeloid cells (eg, nuclear findings, malignant populations of cells). </p><p>An early myeloid arrest is associated with a higher risk of infection due to inability to deliver mature neutrophils to the tissues, whereas even severe neutropenia in the face of a late myeloid arrest is rarely associated with increased propensity for infection due to the neutropenia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F101294\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101294 \">figure 1</a>).

Thus, once a defect in neutrophil production is documented, a search for related disorders such as lupus, or genetic testing for specific neutrophil defects, is often the next step.

Although there are some subtle findings that may lead one to suspect either neutropenia or neutrophil dysfunction as a cause of recurrent infection, there is a great deal of overlap in the clinical presentations with those of other immune deficiency states. Additional discussion of typical presenting findings for immunodeficiency and patterns seen in specific syndromes are presented separately.

These normal neutrophil functions are described in more detail in review articles and in a separate topic review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-evaluation-of-neutrophil-disorders/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Superoxide production is the major mechanism of intracellular killing of bacteria (the final step in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F100385\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100385 \">figure 2</a>)). Neutrophils in patients with CGD have markedly impaired ability to kill bacteria. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-granulomatous-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic granulomatous disease: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Approximately 70 percent of patients with CGD are males who have X-linked disease; the remaining cases are autosomal recessive. Female carriers of X-linked disease have no increased risk of infection. Rarely, in cases of extreme lyonization (skewed X-inactivation), female carriers who have &lt;5 to 10 percent of neutrophils able to make superoxide may have clinical symptoms of mild CGD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-granulomatous-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic granulomatous disease: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The diagnosis of CGD is established by showing absence of the ability to make superoxide in response to stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F100391\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100391 \">table 1</a>). Superoxide production is indirectly assayed as an inability to reduce dihydrorhodamine (DHR) to its fluorescent form (which can be assayed using flow cytometry) or to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT), which is assayed using the NBT slide test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F100539\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100539 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-evaluation-of-neutrophil-disorders/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The DHR flow cytometry testing is generally preferred, though in experienced hands, the NBT test is excellent for detection of the disease state. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Individuals with X-linked or recessive disease are unable to reduce DHR and have no blue staining on the NBT slide test. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Individuals with recessive CGD, particularly defects in p47phox component of the oxidase, and some very rare patients with X-linked disease may make a very small amount of superoxide that is detectible by DHR reduction. This small amount of superoxide production is generally not detectable by the NBT slide test. The patients who make a small amount of superoxide have fewer infections and improved survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-evaluation-of-neutrophil-disorders/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In female carriers of X-linked disease, approximately 50 percent of the neutrophils have no superoxide production, and 50 percent have completely normal superoxide production. Thus, there is usually a clear bimodal distribution of DHR fluorescence by flow cytometry and a bimodal distribution of NBT reduction on the NBT slide test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F100539\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100539 \">figure 3</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Of note, the reaction with DHR depends on myeloperoxidase; thus, patients with concomitant complete myeloperoxidase deficiency can have a false positive DHR-based test (ie, no fluorescence detected) and a CGD-like phenotype. Some female patients with a high degree of lyonization may have low percentages of DHR-positive or NBT-positive cells. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Carriers of X-linked disease with less than 10 to 15 percent activity may have symptomatic infections and may require treatment for mild disease. Some patients, particularly the patients with defects in p47phox, may make a very small amount of superoxide and have a somewhat milder clinical course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-evaluation-of-neutrophil-disorders/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Genetic testing is recommended for the proband, to classify the defect and permit prenatal diagnosis if required. NBT or DHR on fetal blood samples has been performed but is very difficult and unreliable. Essentially, all of the patients have a detectable genetic defect.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>LAD-I</strong> &ndash; Leukocyte adhesion deficiency I (LAD-I) is caused by reduction or absence of the transmembrane protein CD18, the common chain of the beta 2 integrin family, which in turn reduces the amount of the linked alpha subunit receptors CD11a, CD11b, and CD11c used for neutrophil adhesion to the vessel wall (the second step in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F100385\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100385 \">figure 2</a>)). These integrins mediate firm adhesion at sites of endothelium where intracellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs) are upregulated on vascular endothelium due to local infection and cytokines. Subsequently, transmigration and chemotaxis are triggered. This receptor also mediates complement-mediated phagocytosis. Motility is affected because the cells cannot grip the endothelial substrate. Patients with LAD-I have high white blood cell (WBC) counts and severe infections from birth, due to motility and phagocytosis defects. The diagnosis is established by flow cytometry with fluorescently labeled antibodies against CD11b (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F100524\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100524 \">figure 4</a>) or CD18 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F74505\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74505 \">figure 5</a>) that show absent (severe form) or markedly reduced (mild phenotype) surface labeling (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F100391\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100391 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F74505\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74505 \">figure 5</a>).

These form the &quot;marginated pool&quot; of neutrophils that move slowly on the vessel wall and are prepared to engage the strong adhesion medicated by <span class=\"nowrap\">CD18/CD11b</span> and ICAMs. Patients have mental retardation, short stature, and distinctive facial appearance with a depressed nasal bridge, and mild neutrophilia.

These are significant lesions and are characterized by the absence of exudate in the setting of significant leukocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-evaluation-of-neutrophil-disorders/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The skin infections associated with severe chemotactic defects tend to be severe enough to lead to permanent scarring. Attempts to drain these lesions are often unsuccessful because neutrophils cannot migrate to the site of infection to form abscesses.</p><p>Unlike patients with severe neutropenia, patients with neutrophil dysfunction rarely present with overt sepsis but rather with more indolent infections in the lymph nodes, lung, or liver. The fevers are usually low-grade, and it is often difficult to culture organisms. Certain organisms such as <em>Serratia</em>, <em>Nocardia</em>, <em>Aspergillus</em>, and <em>Burkholderia cepacia </em>(formerly known as <em>Pseudomonas cepacia</em>) are unusual in normal hosts and immediately raise the possibility of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). <em>Staphylococcus </em>is also a common organism in CGD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H257036\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of assay</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary neutrophil dysfunction significant enough to cause clinical disease accounts for less than 10 percent of all primary immune deficiency states. Thus, unless there is a family history suggestive of a neutrophil dysfunction syndrome (eg, known familial syndrome, history of frequent skin and soft tissue infections without evidence of cellular immunodeficiency), it is appropriate to eliminate other disorders first, including those of immunoglobulins, complement, or T cells, before a primary neutrophil dysfunction syndrome is considered. Details of the diagnostic evaluation for humoral and T cell disorders are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-evaluation-of-the-immune-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory evaluation of the immune system&quot;</a>.)</p><p>One possible exception to this rule is an evaluation for CGD, because of the ease of performing the screening NBT slide test or DHR florescence assay. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-disorders-of-phagocytic-function-an-overview#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary disorders of phagocytic function: An overview&quot;, section on 'Chronic granulomatous disease'</a>.).</p><p>Once other immune defects have been eliminated, the choice of initial assay for neutrophil dysfunction depends on a variety of factors, including the presence of a known familial defect, characteristic physical or laboratory findings (eg, depressed nasal bridge and mental retardation in LAD-II, giant azurophilic granulocyte granules in Chediak-Higashi syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F57556\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57556 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F71313\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71313 \">picture 1</a>), absence of granules and bilobed neutrophils in neutrophil-specific granule deficiency (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F71996\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71996 \">picture 3</a>)) and the urgency of diagnosis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have characteristic clinical or laboratory findings, or a known family history of a specific disorder, may proceed directly to genetic testing. (See <a href=\"#H80309260\" class=\"local\">'Genetic testing'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients without findings characteristic for a specific disorder should be evaluated for CGD using flow cytometry with dihydrorhodamine (DHR). This test is quantitative and is useful in the identification of affected individuals and heterozygotes (ie, carriers). This procedure is widely available in reference laboratories and has generally replaced the nitroblue tetrazolium test (NBT test). However the NBT test can be used for screening purposes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flow-cytometry-for-the-diagnosis-of-primary-immunodeficiencies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flow cytometry for the diagnosis of primary immunodeficiencies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-granulomatous-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic granulomatous disease: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients suspected of having LAD-I can be evaluated with flow cytometry for deficiency of <span class=\"nowrap\">CD11b/CD18</span> (characteristic of LAD-I).

Ultimately, definitive diagnosis may require specialized flow cytometric or molecular methods available in reference laboratories or specialized centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-evaluation-of-neutrophil-disorders/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H80310358\"><span class=\"h2\">Challenges in more specialized neutrophil function testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of assays have been developed to assess neutrophil adhesion, transmigration, shape change, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, bactericidal killing, and respiratory burst. These have been employed in clinical settings. However, these assays measure cellular behavior; they have tremendous inherent variability and require special laboratory expertise and constant practice to make them work, along with careful determination of normal age-related controls. Thus, while these assays have been useful in the research laboratory setting to clarify the cellular physiology of various specific disease states, they have essentially no place in routine clinical practice, with the exception of measurement of the respiratory burst for the diagnosis of CGD. </p><p>In addition to the challenges of performing these biological assays, another issue is the effect of clinical factors other than primary neutrophil dysfunction on the results. As examples, neutrophil functions are significantly affected by general inflammation, methods of blood drawing, age of the specimen, and myriad other issues, making the interpretation very difficult. Thus, with the exception of genetic disorders that impair neutrophil production, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to tell if the measured change in neutrophil function is the cause of infection or if the infection and attendant inflammation is causing the decrease in neutrophil function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H80309260\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genetic testing is appropriate for patients with a suspected genetic cause of neutropenia or neutrophil dysfunction based on findings from the patient and family history, physical examination, complete blood count, peripheral blood smear, bone marrow, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neutrophil function assay. Specific gene defects associated with each of the disorders are presented in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F100391\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100391 \">table 1</a>). The choice of gene test, and decision of whether to test for all genetic defects or to test a panel of genes, is individualized depending on specific clinical factors, available testing, and input from a clinician with expertise in immunodeficiency and hematologic disorders.

Bone marrow evaluation, including an aspirate and a biopsy, often plays an important role in evaluating neutropenia and distinguishing between decreased production and peripheral <span class=\"nowrap\">destruction/sequestration</span>. An early myeloid arrest (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F101294\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101294 \">figure 1</a>) is associated with a higher risk of infection due to inability to deliver mature neutrophils to the tissues. (See <a href=\"#H80308544\" class=\"local\">'Overview of causes (neutropenia)'</a> above and <a href=\"#H80308607\" class=\"local\">'Bone marrow evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Causes of neutrophil dysfunction can be understood as defects in one or more steps in normal neutrophil processes, including adhesion to the vascular wall, chemotaxis into the tissues, phagocytosis of pathogens, and bacterial killing; these steps are illustrated in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F100385\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100385 \">figure 2</a>). All of the genetic neutrophil dysfunction disorders that result from defects along this pathway are very rare disorders and, with the exception of a few disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F100391\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100391 \">table 1</a>), including chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) I and II, Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS), and hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (HIES, Job syndrome), these cannot be diagnosed without the help of a specialized research laboratory and an immunologist with special expertise in neutrophil disorders.
