As the lifespan of HIV-infected patients has increased, malignancies have become a known cause of morbidity and mortality in this population. Before the advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART), malignancies accounted for approximately 10 percent of HIV-related deaths. Since the routine implementation of ART, a cancer diagnosis is made in over 40 percent of HIV-infected patients during the course of the HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], and over 28 percent of HIV-related deaths are attributable to malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>There are three acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining malignancies: Kaposi sarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) of high-grade pathologic type and of B cell or unknown immunologic phenotype, and invasive cervical carcinoma. In addition, non-AIDS-defining malignancies contribute to mortality in HIV-infected persons.

Some behave indolently with lymphadenopathy waxing and waning over years. Others are highly aggressive, resulting in death within weeks if left untreated. Although indolent lymphoma may occur, most lymphoma in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive population is clinically aggressive. Less common presentations of systemic lymphoma include abnormal laboratory results, such as unexplained cytopenias, hypercalcemia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, or tumor lysis syndrome (ie, lactic acidosis, hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia).

Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), a non-AIDS-defining malignancy, has a lower incidence with severe immunosuppression than with moderate immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. While the incidence of AIDS-defining illnesses (ADI) has decreased overall since the introduction of ART, the proportion of AIDS defining illnesses attributable to NHL has increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/19,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,24</a>]. NHL is one of the most common and most frequently fatal of the AIDS-defining illnesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], though survival has improved significantly since the introduction of ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. HIV-associated lymphoma typically presents in an aggressive fashion, with diffuse large B cell lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma comprising the majority of cases; low-grade (indolent) lymphomas are less common and typically occur in patients with relatively high CD4 counts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>When compared with lymphoma in the HIV-negative population, systemic NHL in the HIV-positive population is characterized by frequent B symptoms (ie, fever, weight loss, night sweats), extranodal disease, involvement of unusual locations (eg, body cavity, rectum, soft tissue), and advanced stage disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/8,28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,28-31</a>] &#160; Often, the clinical manifestations of systemic NHL in HIV-infected patients are protean, with no pathognomonic features. Initial symptoms include diffuse adenopathy, low-grade fevers, and minor hematologic or biochemical abnormalities that may be more suggestive of a viral or bacterial infection. A subset of HIV-positive patients with NHL will present with fever of unknown origin (FUO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. In two case series, lymphoma was the underlying etiology in approximately 6 percent of HIV-infected patients with FUO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. A subsequent case-control study found that of patients with FUO, lymphoma was the etiology in 14 percent of patients on antiretroviral therapy and 8 percent of those who were not (a difference that was not statistically significant) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

Mass lesions can cause obstruction of, or bleeding within, the hollow viscera. Tumor infiltration can also interfere with normal organ function. The most common sites of extranodal involvement are the gastrointestinal tract, bone marrow, liver, lung, and central nervous system. These extranodal sites are commonly involved in aggressive NHL, regardless of HIV status.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastrointestinal tract</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most information regarding gastrointestinal (GI) lymphoma in the HIV-positive population comes from the era before the routine implementation of ART, since this condition is most commonly associated with advanced HIV and low CD4 counts. Based on older series, the gastrointestinal tract is the presenting site of AIDS-related systemic lymphoma in 30 to 50 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/16,36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,36-38</a>], and is the most frequent site of extranodal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>]. A more recent series indicates the rate of GI involvement to be 14 percent of AIDS-related lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The area of gastrointestinal tract involvement is different from that in the non-HIV setting. Virtually any area of the gastrointestinal tract may be involved, including the oral cavity, esophagus, bile duct, pancreas, mesentery, small bowel, perianal area, and anal canal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/29,36,37,39,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,36,37,39,41</a>]. </p><p>In one series of 48 patients with HIV-associated gastrointestinal lymphoma, involvement was multifocal in 23 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

Bone marrow involvement may manifest as peripheral cytopenias (ie, anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia) or related symptoms such as weakness and easy fatigability, infections of variable severity, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bleeding. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Meninges and central nervous system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 5 to 20 percent of patients with HIV-associated systemic NHL have spread to the central nervous system (CNS) at the time of presentation, typically in the form of lymphomatous meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>]. It is not clear that patients with HIV infection are inherently at higher risk for leptomeningeal involvement. It is more likely that the high incidence of CNS disease is related to the greater frequency of extranodal disease and Burkitt histology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/48,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,50</a>]. Lymphomatous meningitis may also present at the time of disease recurrence, particularly in patients at high risk for occult leptomeningeal involvement not treated with intrathecal prophylactic therapy during initial treatment of the lymphoma. Primary CNS lymphoma (ie, NHL of the CNS without systemic disease) accounts for up to 15 percent of NHLs in HIV-infected patients, although its incidence has decreased since the advent of ART. Patients with a diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma do not have a significant risk of CNS involvement. Primary CNS lymphoma is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;AIDS-related lymphomas: Primary central nervous system lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The presence of leptomeningeal disease may not be apparent from the history and physical examination. Almost one-quarter of patients with leptomeningeal involvement are asymptomatic and, even when symptoms occur, only a minority have meningeal signs (ie, nuchal rigidity, Kernig sign, Brudzinski sign) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Other symptoms of leptomeningeal involvement include headache, radicular pain, vague back or neck pain, mental status changes, focal weakness or sensory loss, and cranial nerve palsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

Specific historical features and physical findings that are important to the diagnosis of lymphoma in both the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositive and HIV seronegative populations are presented in detail separately. The following sections review aspects of the evaluation that are specific for patients with HIV. The evaluation choice of specific diagnostic tests varies with the organ site of suspected lymphoma involvement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although few patients diagnosed early in the HIV epidemic were cured of their lymphoma, the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the late 1990s resulted in a marked improvement in the ability of these patients to tolerate standard chemotherapy regimens and in clinical outcomes that now approach those in the general population. Thus, a diagnosis of AIDS-related lymphoma should not discourage appropriate surgical procedures for diagnosis and therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1201065586\"><span class=\"h2\">Biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the diagnosis may be suggested by findings on imaging studies, a definitive diagnosis of lymphoma requires a biopsy. A biopsy should be obtained urgently if an aggressive lymphoma is suspected. Approximately 25 to 35 percent of AIDS-related non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) can be found in the bone marrow at the time of presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/44,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,46</a>]; thus, bone marrow biopsy is part of the standard staging evaluation for NHL and may be a useful diagnostic procedure when obtaining tissue at other sites would result in greater morbidity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-staging-and-response-assessment-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation, staging, and response assessment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Staging'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aids-related-lymphomas-treatment-of-systemic-lymphoma#H6237308\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;AIDS-related lymphomas: Treatment of systemic lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Pretreatment evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Lymph node and tissue biopsy'</a>.)</p><p>Biopsy has a diagnostic yield that ranges from 75 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. The ideal biopsy site is not always clear upon presentation. Initial lymph node biopsies may reveal HIV-related hyperplasia. As such, multiple biopsies may be required to ascertain the diagnosis. 18F-2-deoxyglucose positron-emission tomography (FDG-PET) may be helpful in identifying the most metabolically avid and potentially highest yield site for biopsy. Only excisional biopsy of an intact node consistently allows sufficient tissue for histologic, immunologic, molecular biologic assessment, and classification by experienced hematopathologists. While fine needle aspiration (FNA) of enlarged lymph nodes may demonstrate lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>], a negative result on FNA does not exclude the presence of lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>], and FNA is generally not recommended for diagnosis in patients with suspected lymphoma, as it does not always provide the diagnosis of the specific subtype of lymphoma.

One or more of the following is encountered in at least 80 percent of small intestinal lymphomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-systemic-lymphoma/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Solitary lesions that cause annular infiltration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wall thickening</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focal cavitary lesions</p><p/><p>Endoscopy allows for detection and biopsy of abnormalities located in the esophagus, stomach, or colon. Although technically difficult, endoscopic evaluation of the small bowel with biopsy of lesions can also be diagnostic. Proximal small bowel lesions may be detected by &quot;push&quot; enteroscopy, while lesions in the distal small bowel may be assessed with intubation of the terminal ileum during colonoscopy.

Lumbar puncture should be performed at the time of diagnosis to rule out occult CNS spread for all patients with Burkitt <span class=\"nowrap\">lymphoma/leukemia</span> and for patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma who have &gt;2 extranodal sites of disease accompanied by elevated LDH, or specific high-risk sites such as paranasal sinuses, testes, epidural space, and bone marrow.
