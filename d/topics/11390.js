Effective evaluation of the hip depends upon an understanding of local anatomy and function and the proper performance of a focused physical examination. This topic will review the clinical anatomy and examination of the hip and groin. Specific injuries of structures in the hip or groin are discussed separately in the program.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H517329936\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY AND BIOMECHANICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pelvis is a bony ring-like structure that provides postural support when stationary and during movement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57811\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57811 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F99545\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99545 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-examination-of-the-hip-and-groin/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, the pelvis provides a stable platform for the hip, a ball and socket joint positioned at each inferolateral aspect of the pelvis that enables rotation, flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, and rotation of each lower extremity. The bones forming the hip include the ilium, pubis, and ischium bones. The hip joint consists of the femoral head (ball) and the acetabulum (socket), a cavity created by the hips bones. The depth of the acetabulum is increased by a triangular fibrocartilage structure called the labrum that attaches along its outer rim. </p><p>Posteriorly the ilium articulates with the sacrum. This sacroiliac joint provides a stable connection between the pelvis and the lower spine. This allows force transmitted down the spine to be transferred in part to the pelvis. Conversely, forces absorbed during impact with the ground and transmitted up the lower extremities, during such activities as running and jumping, can be dissipated through the pelvis and spine. The sacroiliac joint is diarthrodial, involving bony surfaces of the ilium and sacrum. The ilial surface is slightly convex and the sacral surface slightly concave, which increases stability and limits motion. Motion is only approximately 3 degrees in both the longitudinal and transverse planes but appears important for normal rotation of the hemipelvis and for flexion and extension of the hip. Below the sacrum, the coccyx forms the distal portion of the spine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-examination-of-the-hip-and-groin/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>The pelvis must support the entire torso and upper extremities, and support of the bony articulations is provided by powerful ligaments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F106837\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106837 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98481\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98481 \">figure 4</a>). At the same time, pelvic motion is a critical aspect of normal walking and running so the left and right hemipelvis have articulations at the sacroiliac joint that allow some rotation and both flexion and extension of the trunk. The sacroiliac ligaments, as well as the sacrotuberous and sacrospinal ligaments, prevent anterior translation of the hemi-pelvis and help to stabilize the joint during motion. The iliolumbar ligament assists in stabilizing the posterior pelvis. The sacroiliac joint is a stress point during motion and thus a frequent location for injury. Anteriorly, the pelvis has a strong ligament that encompasses a disk lying between the superior pubic rami and forms the symphysis pubis. Together the symphysis pubis and sacroiliac joint allow a small degree of anterior translation of the hemipelvis. Combined with posterior translation of the opposite hemipelvis, this motion is sufficient to allow for pelvic rotation in an anteroposterior plane, thereby enabling efficient walking and running. </p><p>Key muscular attachments to the hip and pelvis include those for muscles that stabilize and move the hip joint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F99546\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99546 \">figure 5</a>). On the anterior surface of the hip, the iliacus and psoas descend from the ilium and lumbar vertebrae respectively and fuse to form the iliopsoas muscle, a major hip flexor. The iliopsoas tendon attaches to the lesser trochanter of the proximal femur. Just medial to the iliopsoas on the anterior surface is the pectineus muscle that arises from the anterior aspect of the superior pubic ramus. The pectineus inserts on the superior femur along the pectineal line. The rectus femoris is part of the quadriceps complex but also an important hip flexor. Its major tendinous attachment is found at the antero-inferior iliac spine. Superficial anterior hip muscles include the Sartorius, which arises from the antero-superior iliac spine and crosses the thigh to attach at the pes anserine area. The sartorius is a weak hip flexor and assists with external rotation of the thigh. The tensor fascia lata muscle lies just superior and anterior to the hip and attaches to the iliotibial band [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-examination-of-the-hip-and-groin/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Muscles at the medial surface of the hip control adduction of the hip and thigh and assist with hip flexion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F99547\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99547 \">figure 6</a>). These include the adductor longus, adductor brevis, adductor magnus, and gracilis.</p><p>Muscles lateral to the hip include the gluteus medius and gluteus minimus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98482\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98482 \">figure 7</a>). The tensor fascia lata forms the anterior border of the lateral hip and the anterior fibers of the gluteus maximus form the posterior aspect of the lateral hip. While the gluteus medius is the strongest pure hip abductor, the gluteus minimus and tensor fascia lata assist with abduction when the hip is flexed. Similarly, the gluteus maximus assists with hip abduction when the hip is in extension. </p><p>Muscles at the posterior hip include the gluteus maximus, the major hip extender (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98483\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98483 \">figure 8</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98484\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98484 \">figure 9</a>). Deep to gluteus maximus are smaller muscles that assist in stabilizing the hip during single leg stance and perform hip external rotation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98485\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98485 \">figure 10</a>). These include the piriformis, superior and inferior gemellus, obturator internus, and quadratus femoris muscles.</p><p>Large muscles that attach to pelvis play important roles in providing postural stability and determining pelvic position. At the antero-superior aspect of the pelvis, these muscles include the rectus abdominis and lateral abdominal obliques (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F99548\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99548 \">figure 11</a>). The antero-inferior attachments include the adductor muscles and hip flexors. Posteriorly, the thoracolumbar fascia, latissimus dorsi, erector spinae, and quadratus lumborum muscles all contribute to stability and position of the pelvis. The hamstrings attach to the ischial tuberosity inferiorly.</p><p>The neuroanatomy of the hip and groin region is complex. The lumbosacral plexus is formed by the ventral rami of T12 to S3 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F75983\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75983 \">figure 12</a>). The major nerves that emanate from the plexus include the femoral, obturator, superior and inferior gluteal, and sciatic nerves. The femoral nerve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F66562\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66562 \">figure 13</a>) serves the sartorius, pectineus, and quadriceps musculature, and is most commonly injured by direct trauma. The obturator nerve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F64767\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64767 \">figure 14</a>) originates from the L2 to L4 nerve roots and provides motor innervation to the obturator externus, gracilis, and adductor musculature, and sensory innervation to the medial thigh. The superior gluteal nerve originates from the L4 to S1 nerve roots and provides motor innervation to the gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and the tensor fascia lata. Injury to this nerve can result in a Trendelenburg gait (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74735\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74735 \">picture 1</a>). The inferior gluteal nerve innervates the gluteus maximus. The sciatic nerve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F77473\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77473 \">figure 15</a>) arises from nerve roots L4 to S3 and divides into the tibial and peroneal branches, providing motor innervation to the hamstrings and much of the musculature of the lower leg. The sciatic nerve can be injured by compression at the sciatic notch, possibly by tight piriformis or gluteus muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-examination-of-the-hip-and-groin/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H517329943\"><span class=\"h1\">TIPS FOR A PRODUCTIVE EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following tips may be helpful for performing the hip and groin examination effectively and efficiently:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Observe the patient closely, noting their posture, ability to bear weight, and gait. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Observe the patient walking, looking for Trendelenburg shift (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74735\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74735 \">picture 1</a>), uneven pelvis, inability to flex the hip, or a limp.

Particularly for older adults, consider skipping tests that are likely to cause discomfort or modify them so they are easier on the patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H517330093\"><span class=\"h1\">NEUROVASCULAR ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among patients without a history of trauma or neurologic complaints, a focused neurovascular examination confirming basic motor function and sensation and adequate distal blood flow is sufficient. If there is a history of trauma or a lumbar radiculopathy is suspected based upon the history, it is important to perform the relevant elements of the neurologic evaluation, including examination of the reflexes and lower extremity strength and sensation, and any specific tests relevant to the diagnosis being considered, such as the straight leg raise for lumbar radiculopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute lumbosacral radiculopathy: Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute lumbosacral radiculopathy: Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-detailed-neurologic-examination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The detailed neurologic examination in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21041960\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most athletes or active adults, groin or hip pain that is related to activity stems from a musculoskeletal problem. Thus, the examination of such patients focuses on the soft tissues and bones most likely to be involved. However, depending upon the clinical scenario, it may be important to rule out medical or neurologic conditions (eg, inguinal hernia, urinary tract infection, lumbar radiculopathy, abscess, tumor) and an appropriate physical examination, including evaluation of the genitourinary system, may be necessary. </p><p>The patient with groin pain likely due to a musculoskeletal problem is examined using a standard approach, including: inspection, palpation, range of motion testing, strength testing, and special tests. The emphasis and scope of the examination is focused based upon the most likely diagnoses, as determined by the history. Having the patient indicate the site of pain helps to direct the examination; this area should be examined last to minimize the effects of voluntary guarding. The physical examination is tailored to the individual, and typically includes an assessment of gait, followed by an examination while standing, then lying, and finally special testing based upon the most likely presumptive diagnoses. At each stage, the basic progression of observation, palpation, range of motion testing (both passive and active), and strength testing (both active and resisted) is used. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H517329993\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment of gait and the standing patient</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Begin the examination by watching the patient walk into the room or move from a seated position to lying supine on the examining table; look for signs of weakness, instability, or pain. It is useful to have the patient walk at least six to eight strides while watching for asymmetry, stride length, and internal or external hip rotation. In addition, the presence of snapping or clicking should be assessed as these can be associated with tight iliotibial band structures or intra-articular hip pathology. Trendelenburg gait consists of the trunk lurching toward the affected side during the stance phase of gait (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67453\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67453 \">figure 16</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74735\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74735 \">picture 1</a>), often due to weakness of the abductor muscles on the ipsilateral side that prevents the pelvis from dropping. Trendelenburg gait can also be seen in patients with hip pathology who are trying to avoid the compressive loading of the hip that occurs when the abductors contract. </p><p>Next, with the patient standing, palpate the lumbosacral spine and the sacroiliac joints for tenderness or deformity. Focal tenderness in these areas may indicate spine rather than hip or groin related pathology. Assess for leg length discrepancy by noting the height of the iliac crests. Have the patient bend forward and touch the ground, bend to each side, and rotate and extend their spine. When the patient performs these motions, assess the segmental motion at each level of the lumbar spine: Is it smooth or is there dysfunction, pain, or loss of motion? The Trendelenburg test should be performed with the patient standing while the clinician observes from behind to look for abductor weakness. The Gillet test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98473\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98473 \">picture 2</a>) should be performed to assess for sacroiliac joint dysfunction. (See <a href=\"#H3509051\" class=\"local\">'Special tests for specific conditions'</a> below.)</p><p>The patient should be asked to stand on one leg with the other knee flexed, and then to bend backwards, first on one side then the other. This can help to determine if the sacroiliac joints are functioning normally, and may identify pain or weakness of the pelvic girdle. Significant lumbar pain with one-legged hyperextension may indicate a stress injury of the pars interarticularis (spondylolysis), a common injury among gymnasts, or other posterior elements of the spine. Hyperextension is important to the examination as stronger athletes may compensate using muscle strength and not develop pain until they hyperextend. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spondylolysis-and-spondylolisthesis-in-child-and-adolescent-athletes-clinical-presentation-imaging-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis in child and adolescent athletes: Clinical presentation, imaging, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H517329999\"><span class=\"h2\">Examination with the patient supine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With the patient lying supine, inspect the skin for obvious swelling, scars, lesions, ecchymosis, and erythema or other discoloration. Compare the hips and lower extremities looking for asymmetries. Assess potential leg length discrepancy with the patient supine by measuring the distance from the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) to the medial malleolus. Alternatively, determine whether the ASIS are level (on the same line in the frontal plane) and compare this with how the medial malleoli align. Repeating the assessment of the leg length with the patient going from lying to sitting is useful in excluding a fixed pelvic rotation or sacroiliac joint dysfunction (which can give the false impression of a leg length discrepancy). </p><p>Bone and soft tissue structures that are best evaluated with the patient lying supine include the following: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ASIS</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Greater trochanter of the hip</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Iliac crest</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower lateral border of the rectus abdominis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Iliopsoas</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adductor tendons</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rectus femoris and sartorius muscles and tendons</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pubic symphysis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conjoint tendon </p><p/><p/><p>Palpating the pubic symphysis for tenderness as well as the muscle regions below and above the inguinal ligament can help to determine the source of pain. The adductor tendon, lateral rectus abdominis muscle border, and the iliac crest can all be palpated easily with the patient lying supine. </p><p>Evaluating passive abduction of the hip is easiest with the patient supine. Abduct one leg by lifting at the ankle, while keeping the other ankle fixed in place. Normal abduction is approximately 45 degrees. Adduction is tested using the same grips by bringing one leg across the body, and is normally 20 to 30 degrees, though motion can be limited by tight abductors. Hip flexion is evaluated by having the patient bring both knees towards their chest; normal is approximately 120 degrees. Evaluating internal and external rotation of the hip is performed passively by flexing both the hip and knee to 90 degrees, and then internally and externally rotating the hip. Normal hip internal rotation is 20 to 35 degrees; normal external rotation is 30 to 70 degrees. Another technique is to passively &ldquo;log-roll&rdquo; the fully extended lower limb such that the hip internally and external rotates. Excessive hip rotation raises the question of joint hypermobility in adults. Normally the hip can internally rotate about 10 degrees in this position, and the motion should not be painful. Assessment of mobility is used not only to determine the range of motion but also to detect asymmetries or pain. Asymmetry may indicate arthritis, joint effusion, or other internal derangements, including femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). The FADDIR test can be used to assess further for FAI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98467\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98467 \">picture 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3509051\" class=\"local\">'Special tests for specific conditions'</a> below.)</p><p>After evaluating for passive hip motion, it is useful to evaluate for active and resisted range of motion of the lower extremities to assess for strength as well as pain. The iliopsoas, rectus, adductors, and abductors are often easiest to test with the patient supine. Assess the hip flexors by having the patient perform a straight leg raise with the knee in full extension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98479\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98479 \">picture 4</a>). If they can perform this easily without pain, have them lift the leg again against resistance. Both the iliopsoas and rectus femoris are assessed with this maneuver. The rectus femoris is also a knee extensor and can be tested by resisting knee extension (patient straightens their knee while the examiner resists). The Stinchfield test is used to assess the strength of the iliopsoas, while the Thomas test is used to assess hip flexor tightness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F89742\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89742 \">picture 5</a>). Tight hip flexors can contribute to a number of hip and groin problems, including tendinopathy, rectus femoris tears, and avulsion fractures particularly of the AIIS. </p><p>Evaluate the adductors and abductors with the knees fully extended, then repeat with the knees flexed. Alternatively, hip abduction can be tested while the patient lies on their side or by having them perform repeated lateral straight leg raises, which isolates the gluteus medius and may help to identify subtle weakness. Similarly, an inside straight leg lift with the patient lying on their side and lifting the lower leg against resistance can isolate pure adduction. Test the right sartorius muscle by having the patient place their right heel on their opposite ankle, externally rotate their right hip, and then bring their right heel up to their knee. This motion can be tested with or without resistance. The sartorius can also be tested from a seated position with the examiner applying resistance to an internally rotated lower leg with the hip and thigh in mild flexion and external rotation. </p><p>Hamstring inflexibility contributes to pelvic dysfunction and abnormal pelvic tilt. Since the hamstrings attach to the ischial tuberosity, excessive tightness may pull the inferior pelvis posteriorly and cause the pelvis to rotate if this is unilateral or if bilateral to tilt anteriorly. Hamstring flexibility may be assessed with the patient lying supine by assessing the popliteal angle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F89743\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89743 \">picture 6</a>). With the hip flexed to 90 degrees, and the knee flexed to 90 degrees, the lower leg is slowly lifted in an attempt to straighten the leg completely. If this is possible, the popliteal angle is 0 degrees. Anything short of this is given a positive value. As an example, a popliteal angle of 10 degrees exists when the patient lacks 10 degrees of full knee extension. Hamstring tightness may contribute to knee and low back dysfunction in some athletes. A similar test is used to assess recovery following hamstring injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries#H23895031\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hamstring muscle and tendon injuries&quot;, section on 'Return to work or sport'</a>.)</p><p>With the patient lying supine, the sacral compression and FABER tests (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79475\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79475 \">figure 17</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98468\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98468 \">picture 7</a>) can be performed to assess sacroiliac function. The sacral compression test consists of pushing down on both sides of the pelvis simultaneously. Lack of motion on one side suggests a fixed sacroiliac joint. A positive FABER (or Patrick) test is associated with sacroiliac dysfunction and osteoarthritis of the hip, but sometimes pain is caused by conditions like degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine, iliopsoas contracture, or femoroacetabular impingement. </p><p>Pain patterns differ with the FABER test depending upon the condition causing the limitation. As an example, sacroiliac joint dysfunction may occur at the joint tested or at the contralateral side. Lumbar spine pathology may lead the patient to arch or rotate their lumbar region as the motion of the test becomes uncomfortable. Osteoarthritis and iliopsoas contracture both may cause excessive tightness during this test. FAI can occur from several different anatomic abnormalities and whether the FABER test elicits pain will depend on the nature of the abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-examination-of-the-hip-and-groin/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>While the patient is supine, it may be useful to evaluate for sports hernia, also called athletic pubalgia, and other abnormalities around the pubic symphysis. Palpate the inguinal ligament, pubic symphysis, adductor origins, and conjoined tendon. Patients often feel pain just below the inguinal ligament close to the conjoint tendon but may also experience pain at the insertion of the rectus abdominis and origin of the adductor muscles at the pubic symphysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sports-related-groin-pain-or-sports-hernia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sports-related groin pain or 'sports hernia'&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other pathologies that can present with pain in or near this location include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osteitis pubis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Direct or indirect hernia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Iliopsoas strain or tendinosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adductor strains or tendinosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rectus abdominis strains</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pubic rami stress fractures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Septic arthritis of the pubic symphysis</p><p/><p>Sport hernia (athletic pubalgia) can sometimes be exacerbated by the combined motions of resisted adduction and straight leg raising or with trunk flexion. If the examiner has the patient bring their legs together against resistance and then asks the patient to lift both legs up off the table, pain is often elicited on the side of the sportsman&rsquo;s hernia. Having the patient find the location of maximal pain, and pushing down on this location and then repeating the maneuver can sometimes be associated with decreased pain. Another sign of sportsman&rsquo;s hernia is discomfort while performing a regular hernia check by palpating the inguinal ring through the scrotum for a male. This is often very painful on the side of sportsman&rsquo;s hernia but not painful on the uninvolved side. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H517330005\"><span class=\"h2\">Examination with patient lying on their side</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several structures of the hip and groin are best evaluated with the patient lying on their side. These include the greater trochanter and its surrounding bursa, tensor fascia lata, gluteus musculature, and the lateral aspect of the iliac crest. The tightness of the iliotibial tract can also be assessed from this position. Resisted hip abduction while the knee is held in extension, allows the strength of the gluteus medius to be evaluated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98477\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98477 \">picture 8</a>). Ober&rsquo;s test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63810\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63810 \">picture 9</a>), performed in three different positions, can be used to assess the tightness of the tensor fascia lata, iliotibial tract, and gluteus musculature respectively. Lateral compression of the pelvis, performed by pushing down on the greater trochanter and iliac crest, may produce pain if a pelvic stress fracture or osteitis pubis is present at the pubic symphysis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H517330012\"><span class=\"h2\">Examination with the patient prone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With the patient lying prone, the lower sacrum, sacroiliac joints, sciatic nerve, and lower lumbar spine can be evaluated, as well as the posterior musculature, primarily the hamstrings (biceps femoris, semitendinosus, semimembranosus), gluteals, and piriformis. Injury or dysfunction of these muscles is not commonly a direct cause of groin pain but can contribute to hip and groin pathology, and these muscles should be examined if the history and initial examination suggest such involvement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries#H4095688\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hamstring muscle and tendon injuries&quot;, section on 'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Point tenderness at the ischial tuberosity may be due to hamstring tendinosis or bursitis. Assessment involves testing muscle strength at varying degrees of knee flexion. Tightness of the hip flexors can be assessed by extending the hip with the knee flexed (Ely test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64226\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64226 \">figure 18</a>)) looking for rectus femoris tightness, and with the knee in extension looking for tightness of both the rectus and iliopsoas (modified Thomas test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F89742\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89742 \">picture 5</a>)). (See <a href=\"#H3509051\" class=\"local\">'Special tests for specific conditions'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3509051\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIAL TESTS FOR SPECIFIC CONDITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of special tests for evaluating the hip and groin are used to refine the differential diagnosis and guide diagnostic testing. The tests that we have found to be most useful are described below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-examination-of-the-hip-and-groin/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. The sensitivity and specificity of these tests is largely unstudied. </p><p>Special tests to perform may include the following:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H78200678\"><span class=\"h2\">Tests of hip abductors</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Trendelenburg test</strong> &#8210; While observing the patient from behind, ask the patient to raise their leg (ie, flex their hip and knee simultaneously) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67453\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67453 \">figure 16</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74735\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74735 \">picture 1</a>). A positive test is one where the pelvis drops more than 2 cm, and is indicative of weakness of the contralateral hip abductors. Weakness may be due to gluteus medius muscle weakness or tendinopathy, or compression of the lumbar nerves that supply these muscles (eg, impingement from protruding lumbar disc). </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58309186\"><span class=\"h2\">Tests of hip adductors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessment of the hip adductor muscle and tendon function includes passive stretching of the adductor muscles and adduction against resistance. Examination of the hip adductors is described in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adductor-muscle-and-tendon-injury#H559744\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adductor muscle and tendon injury&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adductor-muscle-and-tendon-injury#H18344791\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adductor muscle and tendon injury&quot;, section on 'Performance of the examination'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H78200684\"><span class=\"h2\">Tests of hip flexors</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Thomas test</strong> &#8210; With the patient lying supine and the hip and knee of one leg flexed and this leg pulled to the chest, the contralateral leg should be able to rest comfortably on the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F89742\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89742 \">picture 5</a>). A positive Thomas test occurs when the contralateral knee cannot be straightened fully, and is indicative of a tight iliopsoas muscle on that side. A painful click when the leg is lowered may represent a labral tear of the hip.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Modified Thomas test</strong> &#8210; From the same starting position as the Thomas test, look to see if the pelvis comes up off the table. A positive test is indicative of hip flexor tightness, involving either the iliopsoas <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rectus femoris.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ely test</strong> &#8210; With the patient lying prone, the examiner passively flexes the patient&rsquo;s knee to about 130 degrees (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64226\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64226 \">figure 18</a>). If the pelvis comes up off the table, this represents a positive test indicative of a tight rectus femoris muscle (as the rectus crosses both the knee and hip) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Stinchfield test</strong> &#8210; Ask the supine patient to raise their leg off the table, while keeping the knee in full extension, against resistance provided by the examiner pressing a hand against the lower shin. The test is positive if it elicits pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> weakness. This test may be impossible for the patient to perform if a fracture is present, but pain or weakness may be due to intra-articular hip or iliopsoas pathology.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H78200690\"><span class=\"h2\">Tests for acetabular pathology</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>FADDIR (Femoral ADDuction Internal Rotation) test</strong> &#8210; With the patient&rsquo;s hip maximally flexed, the clinician grasps the knee and ankle of the same leg and passively flexes the knee to 90 degrees, and then adducts and internally rotates the hip (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98467\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98467 \">picture 3</a>). Pain suggests femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The examiner can place pressure on the lateral aspect of the knee to see if that elicits pain when motion alone does not. This and similar maneuvers are sometimes called impingement provocation techniques. Alternatively, an axial load can be added to this test if the examiner pushes down on the front of the knee, applying force along the axis of the femur with one hand, while stabilizing the pelvis with the opposite hand. If axial compression causes pain as the examiner takes the knee from neutral to internal rotation, intraarticular cartilage injury or labral tear may be the source of pain. This maneuver is sometimes called the axial compression test. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other impingement tests</strong> &#8210; Begin with the affected hip in a flexed, abducted, and externally rotated position, and then internally rotate and adduct it. A sharp, catching pain when the hip is moved in this manner constitutes a positive impingement test and suggests an anterior labral tear. A posterior labral tear (much less common) is detected by passively<sup> </sup>flexing and internally rotating the affected hip while applying pressure posteriorly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-examination-of-the-hip-and-groin/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Sharp pain caused by the maneuver represents a positive test.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Available published evidence suggests that no single positive examination test consistently identifies labral injury. However, if the FADDIR, flexion and internal rotation, impingement provocation, and axial compression tests of the hip are all negative, the diagnosis of a labral tear of the hip is unlikely.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>FABER (Femoral ABduction External Rotation) or Patrick&rsquo;s test</strong> &ndash; Have the patient lay supine and cross the foot of the involved side over their opposite thigh, placing the involved hip in external rotation. Gradually apply pressure to increase external hip rotation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79475\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79475 \">figure 17</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98468\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98468 \">picture 7</a>). Pain with the application of pressure marks a positive test, but significant tightness (limited external rotation) may be suggestive. The FABER test can cause pain in different locations, suggesting different pathologies: pain in the groin suggests osteoarthritis, iliopsoas pathology, or possibly FAI (although FADDIR test is preferred for identifying FAI); pain in the lateral hip suggests degenerative lumbar disc disease; pain posteriorly suggests pathology at the sacroiliac joint. Tight adductor muscles or iliopsoas tendon can limit motion during testing without pain.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H78200696\"><span class=\"h2\">Tests of sacroiliac region</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No single test for sacroiliac joint (SIJ) dysfunction demonstrates high sensitivity or specificity. However, a combination of tests helps to confirm the diagnosis when all are positive. According to a double-blinded trial involving 40 patients with signs of SIJ pain, a combination of three clinical tests (FABER, posterior shear, and resisted abduction) demonstrated high specificity and moderately high sensitivity (ranging from 77 to 87 percent) for SIJ dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-examination-of-the-hip-and-groin/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The gold standard for the study was pain relieved by injection into the symptomatic SIJ under radiographic guidance.</p><p>Other tests for SIJ pain include pelvic <span class=\"nowrap\">distraction/compression,</span> focal SIJ tenderness, seated and standing Gillet's, femoral shear, and modified Gaenslen's. The likelihood of SIJ dysfunction being the source of pain increases markedly if three or more provocation tests are positive. Other factors that suggest SIJ problems include asymmetry of the SI joints when the patient is standing, unilateral pain around the SIJ, focal pain at the sacrum without associated lumbar pain, and pain around the SIJ that increases when the patient rises from a seated position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-examination-of-the-hip-and-groin/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>We use a combination of clinical test that typically include the four listed below.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Posterior shear or thigh thrust test</strong> &ndash; With the patient supine, the examiner places one hand under their sacrum and then flexes their hip and knee both to 90 degrees. With the patient in this position, the examiner applies pressure downward along the axis of the femur. Pain at the ilium or SIJ suggests SIJ dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-examination-of-the-hip-and-groin/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gaenslen test</strong> &ndash; With the patient supine, flex one hip by pushing the patient&rsquo;s knee to their chest, while simultaneously extending the opposite hip joint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98474\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98474 \">picture 10</a>). This maneuver stresses both sacroiliac joints. Posterior pelvic pain indicates a positive test for sacroiliac joint dysfunction. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gillet&rsquo;s test</strong> &ndash; With the patient standing, the examiner positioned behind the patient places each hand along the posterior superior iliac spine and extends each thumb to place them along the sacrum at the same height. Then, the patient is asked to pull one knee towards their chest and hold it there with their hands (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98473\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98473 \">picture 2</a>). Both sides are compared. Normally, the examiner should feel the sacrum move posteriorly on the side where the patient flexes their hip and knee; minimal movement or movement anteriorly marks a positive test. A positive test can be seen with lumbar facet, sacroiliac joint, or pars interarticularis pathology, and may reproduce the patient&rsquo;s pain on the involved side [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-examination-of-the-hip-and-groin/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>FABER test</strong> (see <a href=\"#H78200690\" class=\"local\">'Tests for acetabular pathology'</a> above) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H78200702\"><span class=\"h2\">Tests for lateral hip pain</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ober&rsquo;s test and Modified Ober&rsquo;s test</strong> &#8210; These tests are used primarily to assess tightness of the tensor fascia lata or iliotibial band but may also indicate tightness of the gluteus medius (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63810\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63810 \">picture 9</a>). They are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iliotibial-band-syndrome#H296525661\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iliotibial band syndrome&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H78200708\"><span class=\"h2\">Tests for stress fractures and minor pelvic fractures</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lateral compression test</strong> &#8210; With the patient lying on their side, compress the pelvis by pushing down on the greater trochanter and iliac crest. This test is performed to help diagnose osteitis pubis or pelvic fracture, including stress fracture. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fulcrum test</strong> &#8210; The fulcrum test may be useful when the proximal femur or femoral neck is suspected of having a stress fracture. It is performed by placing one forearm under the area that is painful while the opposite hand applies steady pressure at the end of the femur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F98475\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98475 \">picture 11</a>). This creates a fulcrum effect that stresses the site of suspected injury. Increased pain at the area in question during the test is consistent with a stress fracture.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hop test</strong> &ndash; The Hop test may be used to help detect stress fractures at the femoral neck. It simply involves having the patient hop on the affected leg. The test is nonspecific but should cause pain at the femoral neck in the presence of a stress fracture.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21042073\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many maneuvers are used to assess the hip and groin, and sometimes these are described as if they are pathognomonic for a particular pathology. However, the diagnostic accuracy of many of these tests is not well studied and often limited, particularly when the results are not considered in the context of the history and other examination findings. The clinical anatomy and biomechanics necessary for performing an effective examination of the hip and groin, and tips for making the examination more productive and efficient, are provided in the text. (See <a href=\"#H517329936\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy and biomechanics'</a> above and <a href=\"#H517329943\" class=\"local\">'Tips for a productive examination'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with significant hip or pelvic trauma, neurologic complaints (eg, distal weakness, paresthesias), or unusual presentations, a careful neurovascular assessment is essential; among patients without such complaints, a focused neurovascular examination confirming basic motor function and sensation and adequate blood flow is sufficient. Lumbar radiculopathy is an important consideration in patients with pain or paresthesias that radiate to or from the lumbar spine region or the involved lower extremity. (See <a href=\"#H517330093\" class=\"local\">'Neurovascular assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most athletes or active adults, groin or hip pain that is related to activity stems from a musculoskeletal problem. Thus, the examination of such patients focuses on the soft tissues and bones most likely to be involved. However, depending upon the clinical scenario, it may be important to rule out medical or neurologic conditions (eg, inguinal hernia, urinary tract infection, lumbar radiculopathy, abscess) and an appropriate physical examination, including evaluation of the genitourinary system, may be necessary.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient with groin pain likely due to a musculoskeletal problem is examined using a standard approach, including: inspection, palpation, range of motion testing, strength testing, and special tests. The emphasis and scope of the examination is focused based upon the most likely diagnoses, as determined by the history. To assess the hip and groin in a thorough and systematic fashion, we typically organize the examination by patient position beginning with an assessment of gait and examination of the patient standing, followed by assessment of the patient while supine, on their side, and then prone. Details for each phase or described in the text. (See <a href=\"#H21041960\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once a focused differential diagnosis is established based upon the history and initial examination findings, the clinician may opt to perform special examination maneuvers to help determine the likelihood of a particular diagnosis. Special tests of muscle and tendon groups, such as the hip abductors, hip adductors, and hip flexors, and other tests to assess particular pathology, such as acetabular impingement, sacroiliac joint dysfunction, and femoral stress fracture, are described in the text.
