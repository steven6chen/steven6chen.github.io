It is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Internal concealment of drugs of abuse (body packing)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>&quot;Body stuffing,&quot; the hasty ingestion of drugs in order to evade law enforcement, is a distinct syndrome from body packing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-ingestion-of-illicit-drugs-body-stuffing/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The body stuffer is often at risk for acute toxicity because the drugs are usually unwrapped or poorly wrapped, and not designed for ingestion and transport. </p><p>Body packers tend to ingest packets that contain a large quantity of drug (approximately 1 kg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-ingestion-of-illicit-drugs-body-stuffing/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], whereas body stuffers usually ingest smaller amounts (grams) intended for individual sale. If a packet ingested by a &quot;body packer&quot; ruptures, severe toxicity is likely, whereas a much larger number of body stuffing packets must be ingested for comparable toxicity to develop. </p><p>The diagnosis and management of body stuffing is reviewed here. The toxicities of specific agents commonly abused or ingested are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cocaine-acute-intoxication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cocaine: Acute intoxication&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-opioid-intoxication-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute opioid intoxication in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methamphetamine-acute-intoxication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methamphetamine: Acute intoxication&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-the-critically-ill-adult-with-an-unknown-overdose\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of the critically ill adult with an unknown overdose&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18412977\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Little data are available to provide insight into the scope of the body stuffing problem. However, cases are frequently seen in urban centers where the use of illegal drugs is common. Packaging methods for body stuffers vary widely among different regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-ingestion-of-illicit-drugs-body-stuffing/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. Knowledge of local packaging techniques is essential to assess the potential risk of rupture and drug toxicity. Many drugs of abuse are &quot;stuffed&quot; with cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine among the most common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-ingestion-of-illicit-drugs-body-stuffing/abstract/5,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18412984\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of body stuffing is made either by history or by appreciating signs and symptoms of drug toxicity without a clear history of ingestion. Body stuffers generally develop symptoms and signs of toxicity within hours of ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-ingestion-of-illicit-drugs-body-stuffing/abstract/5,11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,11-13</a>]. Any patient who presents to an emergency department or other clinical setting after being arrested for a drug charge and who rapidly develops characteristic sympathomimetic or opioid toxicity should be suspected of body stuffing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-ingestion-of-illicit-drugs-body-stuffing/abstract/5,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9</a>]. Law enforcement officials should recognize the potential for ingestion when making drug arrests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-ingestion-of-illicit-drugs-body-stuffing/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], as deaths have occurred among incarcerated individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-ingestion-of-illicit-drugs-body-stuffing/abstract/8,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,15,16</a>].<sup> </sup>Clinicians should consider body stuffing in incarcerated individuals brought for medical evaluation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18412991\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When assessing a patient suspected of body stuffing, important questions to ask include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When was the drug ingested?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How many packets were ingested?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What drug and formulation (eg, powdered versus crack cocaine) were ingested?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Were the packets wrapped? If so, how were they wrapped and what materials were used? </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has the patient experienced symptoms of gastrointestinal obstruction or distress?</p><p/><p>If the patient is in police custody, the history may not be forthcoming or accurate, and objective signs may be of greater importance.</p><p>In particular, it is important to obtain specific details about wrapping, which is a key factor in drug absorption. The packaging and method of wrapping has been shown to effect cocaine release in a simulated gastric medium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-ingestion-of-illicit-drugs-body-stuffing/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. One wrapping method involves using the corner of a sandwich bag to hold powder or rock cocaine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F85932\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef85932 \">picture 1</a>), then securing the bag by folding it over once or twice (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F85933\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef85933 \">picture 2</a>). Another common packaging method in the United States consists of placing crack cocaine or heroin in a small Ziploc-style bag. These single layer packets will release drug over time (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F85934\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef85934 \">picture 3</a>). It is important to inquire if one bag was placed in a larger bag (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F85935\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef85935 \">picture 4</a>), as this will make the package less permeable and may increase the risk for gastrointestinal obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-ingestion-of-illicit-drugs-body-stuffing/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In general, paper decomposes rapidly (usually within one hour), while doubly wrapped plastic bags will elaborate drug more gradually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-ingestion-of-illicit-drugs-body-stuffing/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Unwrapped contraband may yield clinical effects within 30 minutes to three hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-ingestion-of-illicit-drugs-body-stuffing/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18412998\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical examination of a body stuffer, either known or suspected, should focus on signs of drug toxicity, intestinal obstruction, and the location of packets. Body stuffers generally develop symptoms and signs of toxicity within hours of ingestion.</p><p>Cocaine is commonly ingested by body stuffers. Therefore, clinician should be alert for signs of the sympathomimetic toxidrome, which often includes hypertension, tachycardia, diaphoresis, agitation, tremors, seizures, hyperthermia, and dilated pupils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-ingestion-of-illicit-drugs-body-stuffing/abstract/12,16,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,16,18</a>]. Methamphetamine is commonly ingested in some regions and produces symptoms and signs similar to cocaine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-ingestion-of-illicit-drugs-body-stuffing/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Ingestion of heroin or other opioids causes a toxidrome that often includes central nervous system depression, hypoventilation, miosis, and decreased bowel sounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-ingestion-of-illicit-drugs-body-stuffing/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The clinical presentation and toxicities associated with these drugs are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cocaine-acute-intoxication#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cocaine: Acute intoxication&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methamphetamine-acute-intoxication#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methamphetamine: Acute intoxication&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-opioid-intoxication-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute opioid intoxication in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical features of overdose'</a>.)</p><p>Intestinal obstruction from body stuffing is rare but potentially dangerous. Clinicians should look for signs of obstruction, such as vomiting, decreased flatus, high-pitched (or absent) bowel sounds, abdominal distension, and abdominal tenderness.</p><p>Body stuffers may place drugs in orifices and locations other than the gastrointestinal tract.<strong> </strong>In hurried attempts to evade arrest, individuals may accidentally aspirate rather than swallow a packet, leading to respiratory distress and clinical deterioration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-ingestion-of-illicit-drugs-body-stuffing/abstract/3,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,19</a>]. Packets have been recovered from the rectum and vagina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-ingestion-of-illicit-drugs-body-stuffing/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In the United Kingdom, specialized forensic physicians trained in the evaluation and management of body stuffers inspect the mouth, nostrils, ears, umbilicus, foreskin, rectum, and vagina of suspects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-ingestion-of-illicit-drugs-body-stuffing/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18413005\"><span class=\"h1\">IMAGING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H309358947\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is little evidence and no controlled studies to determine how best to use diagnostic imaging in body stuffers. Based upon limited observational evidence and our clinical experience, we typically do not perform diagnostic imaging of body stuffers if the history and clinical presentation are straightforward and consistent. However, we sometimes obtain a noncontrast computerized tomography (CT) scan if the history is unclear or it is important to determine if drug packets are present in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. We do not routinely obtain plain abdominal radiographs unless there is concern for GI obstruction or perforation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18413810\"><span class=\"h2\">Plain abdominal radiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plain abdominal radiography is generally unhelpful in managing body stuffers and we do not routinely obtain such studies, unless there is concern for obstruction or perforation. Unlike body packers, in whom the sensitivity of abdominal radiographs approaches approximately 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-ingestion-of-illicit-drugs-body-stuffing/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], body stuffers are not easily identified by abdominal radiography. In one series of 46 cocaine body stuffers, none of the 23 plain radiographs obtained were positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-ingestion-of-illicit-drugs-body-stuffing/abstract/5,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,21</a>]. In another series of crack vial ingestions, only 9 percent of plain radiographs were positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-ingestion-of-illicit-drugs-body-stuffing/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In a series of heroin body stuffers, only 1 radiograph of 32 taken (3 percent) was positive, and in that lone case, metal staples were visible to help identify an unusual packet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-ingestion-of-illicit-drugs-body-stuffing/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In one case series of body packers, plain abdominal radiography with Gastrografin oral contrast was used to detect body stuffers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-ingestion-of-illicit-drugs-body-stuffing/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. This approach has not been investigated in body stuffers. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18413902\"><span class=\"h2\">Computerized tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We do not routinely perform computed tomography (CT) to evaluate body stuffers if the history and clinical presentation are straightforward and consistent; however, CT can be useful if the history is unclear and there is a compelling need to determine if drug packets are present in the GI tract. In such settings, we typically obtain a CT without oral contrast, although CT with oral contrast has also been used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-ingestion-of-illicit-drugs-body-stuffing/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p>Several case reports have described the use of CT without oral contrast to identify ingested packets in body stuffers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-ingestion-of-illicit-drugs-body-stuffing/abstract/5,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,25,26</a>]. However, false negative studies have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-ingestion-of-illicit-drugs-body-stuffing/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. According to one observational study, the attenuation of a crack cocaine packet is 91 Hounsfield units [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-ingestion-of-illicit-drugs-body-stuffing/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>One study in human volunteers using a simulated model of boiled rice noodles and ultrasound gels tightly wrapped in multiple layers of cellophane demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-ingestion-of-illicit-drugs-body-stuffing/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], although it is unclear whether the results using this model can be extrapolated to the typical packaging of drug loosely wrapped in sandwich or Ziploc bags. In another volunteer study using simulated drug packets with attenuation of 78 Hounsfield units, CT without contrast identified only 60 percent of packets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-ingestion-of-illicit-drugs-body-stuffing/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H309359106\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY TESTING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18413909\"><span class=\"h2\">Urine toxicology screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The utility of performing toxicology screening in body stuffers remains uncertain. In many cases, packets are poorly wrapped, and drug is released and absorbed. In such cases, urine drug testing may help to identify the ingested substance. However, it is difficult to distinguish between a positive result due to recreational consumption from one due to drug liberated from an ingested packet.</p><p>In general, patients in whom symptomatic poisoning is suspected should undergo bedside glucose determination if there is any alteration in mental status, an electrocardiogram (to rule out any conduction abnormalities), and a urine pregnancy test (in women of childbearing age). Additional laboratory evaluation depends upon the ingested substance and the degree of toxicity. Please see the relevant UpToDate topics for details, including the following: (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cocaine-acute-intoxication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cocaine: Acute intoxication&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-opioid-intoxication-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute opioid intoxication in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methamphetamine-acute-intoxication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methamphetamine: Acute intoxication&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mdma-ecstasy-intoxication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;MDMA (ecstasy) intoxication&quot;</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18413012\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58963291\"><span class=\"h2\">Decontamination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of gastrointestinal decontamination for body stuffers is controversial, and there are few clinical studies to guide management. We believe it is reasonable in most cases to administer a single dose of activated charcoal (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg;</span> maximum dose 50 g) to asymptomatic body stuffers. In vitro evidence suggests that activated charcoal (AC) adsorbs cocaine well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-ingestion-of-illicit-drugs-body-stuffing/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. However, no clinical series have been conducted to assess its impact on patient outcome. </p><p>Although some researchers suggest the use of whole bowel irrigation (WBI) with polyethylene glycol electrolyte lavage solution (PEG-ELS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-ingestion-of-illicit-drugs-body-stuffing/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], this too, is controversial. We do not routinely suggest treatment with WBI in the management of body stuffers. Furthermore, WBI is contraindicated in body stuffers who are hemodynamically unstable or markedly symptomatic. Hypotension from any cause, as well as cocaine intoxication, impairs bowel perfusion, thereby increasing the risk of ileus and obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-ingestion-of-illicit-drugs-body-stuffing/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Although WBI has been shown to be safe and feasible in body <strong>packers</strong>, there is no such supporting literature for body <strong>stuffers</strong>. Case series of body stuffers treated with AC, WBI, or both, have not reported a clear benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-ingestion-of-illicit-drugs-body-stuffing/abstract/5,9,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9,12</a>]. A retrospective study suggested that WBI was unlikely to be performed correctly (if at all) in body stuffers, even after a recommendation from a Poison Control Center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-ingestion-of-illicit-drugs-body-stuffing/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18413019\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptomatic patients</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18413916\"><span class=\"h3\">Cocaine and other sympathomimetic toxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments for body stuffers demonstrating signs of sympathomimetic overdose should be initiated immediately. Benzodiazepines are an important treatment for many of the toxicities caused by cocaine or methamphetamine (eg, agitation, hypertension, hyperthermia).

Depending upon the intoxicants ingested, refractory signs in unresponsive patients may include hypotension or hypertension, tachycardia, hyperthermia, and profoundly altered mental status. (See <a href=\"#H18412998\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.) </p><p>Symptomatic patients who can be managed effectively without surgical intervention are admitted to a location capable of providing an appropriate level of physiologic monitoring for detecting any sign of deterioration. The appropriate setting is determined by the level of exposure (eg, amount of drug or number of packets ingested), the presence of any coingestants, comorbidities, the patient's clinical status, and the resources available. Patients with severe symptoms and signs or potentially dangerous ingestions are observed in an intensive care setting. Assistance from a medical toxicologist or poison control center may be needed to determine the appropriate level of monitoring.

We discharge patients with an uncomplicated history of ingesting a small number of packets (fewer than 10) who remain asymptomatic after 6 to 12 hours of observation. Opioids can lead to gastrointestinal atony, which can complicate the course by increasing packet transit time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-ingestion-of-illicit-drugs-body-stuffing/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Provided the patient remains asymptomatic, 6 to 12 hours of observation is usually sufficient in patients with delayed gastrointestinal transit. </p><p>In one series of 46 cocaine body stuffers, all eight patients who developed symptoms or signs of toxicity had some apparent abnormality upon arrival to the hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-ingestion-of-illicit-drugs-body-stuffing/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, another case report of a cocaine body stuffer describes the development of altered mental status, seizure-like activity, and a wide complex dysrhythmia 14 hours after ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-ingestion-of-illicit-drugs-body-stuffing/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A retrospective review reported no late complications among low risk cocaine body stuffers once they became asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-ingestion-of-illicit-drugs-body-stuffing/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Patients were considered low risk if they were asymptomatic, not in police custody, and were not body packers.</p><p>Patients with a concerning history or findings that put them at higher risk for severe toxicity should be admitted to an intensive care setting where they can be closely monitored for signs of deterioration. Monitoring should include frequent vital signs, pulse oximetry, cardiac monitoring, and end-tidal CO2 for early detection of apnea. Important things to consider when deciding on the appropriate disposition include the number of drug packets ingested and the method used to wrap the drugs. As an example, a history of consuming a larger bag containing many smaller bags, or ingesting a massive number of packets, suggests the need for a longer period of observation. In such cases, the clinician should ensure that all packets have passed the pylorus.</p><p>Another important factor to consider when determining disposition is whether a patient can return promptly for medical evaluation should the need arise, or whether a complicated and time-consuming jail transfer would be involved, placing the patient at additional risk. </p><p>When determining the appropriate observation period for all but the most straightforward cases, clinicians are encouraged to consult a medical toxicologist or contact a poison control center.

The body stuffer is often at risk for acute toxicity because the drugs are usually unwrapped or poorly wrapped, and not designed for ingestion and transport. Body packing is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Internal concealment of drugs of abuse (body packing)&quot;</a>.).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of body stuffing is made either by history or by appreciating signs and symptoms of drug toxicity without a clear history of ingestion. Any patient who presents to an emergency department or other clinical setting after being arrested for a drug charge and who rapidly develops characteristic sympathomimetic or opioid toxicity should be suspected of body stuffing. (See <a href=\"#H18412984\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although body stuffers may not provide an accurate history, clinicians should inquire about the type and amount of drug ingested, the number of and wrapping used for any drug packets ingested, and whether they are experiencing any gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms consistent with obstruction or perforation. Cocaine, methamphetamine, and opioids (eg, heroin) are among the drugs most commonly ingested by stuffers. (See <a href=\"#H18412991\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical examination of a body stuffer, either known or suspected, should focus on signs of drug toxicity, intestinal obstruction, and the location of packets. Signs of sympathomimetic or opioid toxicity are most common and are described in the text. Body stuffers generally develop symptoms and signs of toxicity within hours of ingestion. (See <a href=\"#H18412998\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We typically do not perform diagnostic imaging of body stuffers if the history and clinical presentation are straightforward and consistent. However, we sometimes obtain a noncontrast computerized tomography (CT) scan if the history is unclear or it is important to determine if drug packets are present in the GI tract. We do not routinely obtain plain abdominal radiographs unless there is concern for GI obstruction or perforation. (See <a href=\"#H18413005\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Body stuffers should be treated aggressively for signs of sympathomimetic or opioid toxicity. Benzodiazepines are an important treatment for many of the toxicities caused by cocaine or methamphetamine (eg, agitation, hypertension, hyperthermia). Body stuffers demonstrating signs of opioid toxicity (eg, depressed mental status, hypoventilation, pinpoint pupils) should be treated immediately with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naloxone</a>. The initial dose is 0.05 mg in patients with spontaneous ventilations, and 0.2 to 1 mg in apneic patients. Tables summarizing the emergent management of cocaine, methamphetamine, and opioid (eg, heroin) poisoning are provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F70334\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70334 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73681\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73681 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55540\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55540 \">table 3</a>). Management of these poisonings is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cocaine-acute-intoxication#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cocaine: Acute intoxication&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cocaine-acute-intoxication#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cocaine: Acute intoxication&quot;, section on 'Initial management'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methamphetamine-acute-intoxication#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methamphetamine: Acute intoxication&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methamphetamine-acute-intoxication#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methamphetamine: Acute intoxication&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients not responsive to pharmacologic therapy for signs of severe sympathomimetic or opioid poisoning may require surgical removal of retained packets. Symptomatic patients who can be managed effectively without surgical intervention are admitted to a location capable of providing an appropriate level of physiologic monitoring for detecting any sign of deterioration. (See <a href=\"#H309359670\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymptomatic body stuffers typically require approximately 6 to 12 hours of observation before they can be discharged safely. Body stuffers who have ingested packets with complicated wrapping or show signs of delayed gastrointestinal transit require longer periods of observation, and possibly imaging studies. (See <a href=\"#H18413935\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic patients'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-ingestion-of-illicit-drugs-body-stuffing/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">McCarron MM, Wood JD.
