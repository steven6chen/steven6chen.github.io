However, milk production normally affects maternal body composition and nutritional status, and lactating women have increased nutrient demands.</p><p>The changes in maternal nutritional status during lactation, effect of maternal nutrition on milk volume and composition, and nutrient requirements of lactating women are reviewed here. Additional aspects of breastfeeding are discussed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initiation-of-breastfeeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initiation of breastfeeding&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=common-problems-of-breastfeeding-and-weaning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Common problems of breastfeeding and weaning&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breastfeeding-parental-education-and-support\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breastfeeding: Parental education and support&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-contraception-initiation-and-methods#H626594215\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum contraception: Initiation and methods&quot;, section on 'Impact on lactation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECTS OF LACTATION ON THE MOTHER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lactation is supported partially by mobilization of tissue stores. This, in turn, affects maternal weight and nutritional status.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Body weight</strong> &ndash; Postpartum weight changes in lactating women are highly variable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Mild, gradual weight loss typically occurs during the first six months postpartum. Excessive weight gain during pregnancy is the most consistent and strongest predictor of postpartum weight change in most studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Other factors that contribute to weight loss after pregnancy include prepregnancy weight, age, parity, race, smoking, exercise, and return to work outside the home. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-postpartum-period-physiology-complications-and-maternal-care#H46\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the postpartum period: Physiology, complications, and maternal care&quot;, section on 'Postpartum weight retention'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Data are conflicting on the effect of breastfeeding on postpartum weight changes. Most studies indicate that lactation has little effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/3-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-8</a>]. In some reports, weight loss was less in lactating than nonlactating women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/2,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9-11</a>], whereas other studies report more weight loss in lactating women than nonlactating women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. A systematic review found little or no association between breastfeeding and weight change, although this seemed to depend on the measurement time points and breastfeeding intensity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, four out of five studies of high methodological quality demonstrated a positive association between breastfeeding and weight change. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lean body mass</strong> &ndash; Although some women may lose weight while breastfeeding, the lean body mass of well-nourished women is preserved during the first six months of lactation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This is thought to be due to an adaptive response of protein metabolism when dietary protein is restricted so that body protein degradation is reduced more than synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vitamins</strong> &ndash; Fat-soluble and water-soluble vitamins are secreted into milk. Therefore, the dietary requirement for most vitamins is increased during lactation. A chronically deficient diet will deplete maternal stores of some vitamins. For women consuming a balanced diet, the increased nutrient requirements can be met by the overall increase in food intake. For some restrictive diets, dietary supplements may be necessary. (See <a href=\"#H750771169\" class=\"local\">'Vitamins and minerals'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bone mineral loss</strong> &ndash; Bone mineral content declines during lactation, and compensatory remineralization occurs after weaning and resumption of menses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. Changes in calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium homeostasis are independent of maternal dietary intake. Lactation is associated with bone reabsorption, in part due to relatively low estradiol concentrations. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Breastfeeding does not increase the risk of low bone mineral density (BMD), osteoporosis, or fracture in the long term. In fact, a protective effect of breastfeeding on the subsequent risk of osteoporosis has been demonstrated in a number of epidemiological studies. As an example, a study in 4681 postmenopausal women examined the effect of breastfeeding on risk for fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Breastfeeding was associated with a 50 percent lower risk for hip fracture and 27 percent lower risk for fragility fracture, after adjustment for known risk factors. Longer duration of breastfeeding reduced the age-adjusted risk for hip fracture by 12 percent for each additional 10 months of breastfeeding. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2752995736\"><span class=\"h1\">DETERMINANTS OF MILK VOLUME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Healthy exclusively breastfeeding women produce approximately 750 to 800 mL per day of milk when lactation is fully established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, milk volume varies among individuals and can exceed 2000 mL per day in women with hyperlactation or those nursing twins or triplets.</p><p>Milk volume is low on the first two days postpartum, increases markedly on days three and four, then gradually increases to levels seen in full lactation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Milk volume typically decreases later in lactation (eg, beyond six months postpartum), primarily because of weaning. In a cohort of healthy infants, the average (range) of breast milk volumes at 6, 9, and 12 months postpartum were 769 (335 to 1144), 637 (205 to 1185), and 445 (27 to 1154) mL per day, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The wide range of milk volume during late lactation reflects differences in the timing and rate of weaning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Infant demand</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Milk production is determined mostly by infant demand rather than maternal lactation capacity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. This is illustrated by the ability of mothers to successfully breastfeed twins or triplets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The infant's demand depends in turn on age and rate of weight gain, as well as any medical disorders that affect the infant's metabolic needs or ability to feed efficiently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/25,28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,28-30</a>]. Healthy infants who are fed on demand tend to stimulate normal milk volumes and achieve good growth despite individual variation in feeding schedules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The addition of milk substitutes or solid foods reduces infant demand for breast milk, and thus reduces milk production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Maternal nutrition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mild or moderate variations in maternal diet, energy balance, and aerobic exercise generally do not affect milk production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/29,34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,34-36</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dieting &ndash; Mild or moderate reductions in maternal energy intake appear to have a limited effect on milk volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/34,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,37</a>]. In one study, dietary restriction to 1500 kcal per day for one week did not reduce milk production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Similarly, moderate weight loss with or without exercise does not adversely affect lactation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>]. In one study, lactating women were randomly assigned to an 11-day program of diet, diet plus exercise, or control at 12 weeks postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Weight loss averaged 1.9, 1.6, and 0.2 kg in the three groups, respectively, while milk volume and composition, and infant weight gain were similar during the short study period.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Longer periods of dieting are also well tolerated. In one report, 22 of 33 women who completed a 10-week weight reduction program lost an average of 5 kg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Daily milk production was similar at baseline and 10 weeks (759 versus 802 mL), and infants gained an average of 21 gm per day. In another study, overweight lactating women were randomly assigned to reduce energy intake by 500 kcal per day and exercise for 45 minutes four times per week or to maintain their usual diet and limit exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Women in the diet and exercise group lost more weight (4.8 versus 0.8 kg) and fat mass (4 versus 0.3 kg) than controls. Infant weight gain was similar, although the statistical power to detect a difference in weight gain was limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe energy restriction &ndash; More extreme nutritional deprivation may have substantial effects on milk volume. In the study cited above, daily milk volume decreased 15 percent when fewer than 1500 kcal per day were consumed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Similarly, some studies of poor women in resource-limited countries report milk volumes as low as 525 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day,</span> while other women produce milk volumes over 800 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day,</span> which is similar to average milk volumes in women in resource-rich countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/37,43-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,43-49</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3796386113\"><span class=\"h2\">Other factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other factors that decrease milk volume include incomplete breast emptying and infrequent milk expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>], as well as maternal smoking, maternal stress, anxiety, fatigue, and illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/51-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-54</a>]. In addition, use of combined <span class=\"nowrap\">estrogen/progesterone</span> oral contraceptives (COCs) moderately reduce milk volume. In one report, milk production by women using COCs was decreased by 12 percent compared with women taking progestin-only contraceptives, and by 6 percent compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Nonetheless, infant growth was similar, perhaps because more prolonged or intense feeding periods or supplementary feedings compensated for the reduced milk volume. A systematic review found moderate quality evidence for an effect of COCs on milk volume, and overall inconsistent results for other types of hormonal contraceptives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Because there is no firm evidence that hormonal contraceptives interfere with breastfeeding success, an individualized approach seems appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology recommends that &quot;obstetric care providers should discuss these limitations and concerns within the context of each woman's desire to breastfeed and her risk of unplanned pregnancy, so that she can make an autonomous and informed decision&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-contraception-initiation-and-methods#H626594215\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum contraception: Initiation and methods&quot;, section on 'Impact on lactation'</a>.) </p><p>Skin-to-skin contact between a mother and her preterm infant in the newborn intensive care unit may increase milk production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-milk-expression-for-the-preterm-infant#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast milk expression for the preterm infant&quot;, section on 'Skin-to-skin contact'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECTS OF THE MATERNAL DIET ON MILK QUALITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lactation requires additional energy and nutrients from the diet. Milk quality is usually sufficient to support infant growth, even when the mother's dietary supply of energy and nutrients is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, a chronically deficient diet can deplete maternal nutrient stores and adversely affect milk composition.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Protein content</strong> &ndash; Maternal diet typically does not affect the quantity or quality of milk protein, even in malnourished populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/61-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-63</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fat content</strong> &ndash; The proportion of dietary fat in the maternal diet has minimal effects on the <strong>quantity</strong> of fatty acids in human milk; however, the type of fat consumed by the mother influences the fatty acid composition of the milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>]. As an example, maternal consumption of omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFA), which include docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), affects concentrations of these fatty acids in breastmilk. The relevance of n-3 PUFA to infant brain development has been suggested, but not confirmed in most clinical studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=long-chain-polyunsaturated-fatty-acids-lcpufa-for-preterm-and-term-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) for preterm and term infants&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Despite lack of definitive evidence, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that breastfeeding women take in 200 to 300 mg of omega-3 LCPUFA (eg, DHA) to guarantee a sufficient concentration of preformed DHA in the milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. One to two servings of fish per week is adequate to supply this amount of DHA. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Fish intake'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other variations in the fatty acid content of breast milk may have little clinical relevance. For example, mothers on a low-fat diet produce breast milk with a slightly higher fraction of medium-chain fatty acids compared with mothers consuming a high-fat diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Consumption of partially hydrogenated fats and oils also influences the fatty acid composition of milk. As an example, linoleic acid concentration was higher in milk from vegan mothers than omnivore controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. However, diet does not appear to affect the cholesterol and phospholipid content of human milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fat-soluble vitamins</strong> &ndash; The concentration of fat-soluble vitamins in milk is reduced in maternal vitamin deficiency and increases following supplementation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The vitamin D content of breast milk is constitutively low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/67,70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,70,71</a>], and it is even lower in mothers with dark skin or other causes of maternal vitamin D deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. As a result, all infants require vitamin D supplementation to prevent rickets, and this is particularly important for those whose mothers have vitamin D deficiency. An alternate but rarely used strategy is to administer moderately high doses of vitamin D to the lactating mother (4000 to 6400 international units daily, which is about 10 times the recommended intake), which increases the vitamin D content of the breastmilk to levels that meet the infant's needs. However, higher doses of vitamin D should be avoided; in one report, ergocalciferol 2500 mcg (100,000 international units daily, which is &gt;150 times the recommended intake) resulted in toxic levels in milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents#H723639\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Vitamin D supplementation for infants'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents#H28181888\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Maternal vitamin D deficiency'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Vitamin K concentration in breast milk varies with maternal dietary intake but is generally low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. As a result, infants are at risk for vitamin K deficient bleeding, which can be prevented by routine administration of vitamin K at birth. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-vitamin-k#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of vitamin K&quot;, section on 'Prevention of vitamin K deficient bleeding in newborns'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Vitamin A</a> content in breast milk also varies with the maternal diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Clinically important vitamin A deficiency is rare in infants in resource-rich countries, in the absence of an underlying malabsorptive disease. In parts of the world in which vitamin A deficiency is endemic, routine vitamin A supplementation is no longer recommended for lactating women, neonates, or infants up to six months of age. This is because studies of vitamin A supplementation have shown no consistent health benefits and may have side effects in young infants. High-dose vitamin A supplementation is recommended in infants and children 6 to 59 months of age in settings where vitamin A deficiency is a public health problem. (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-vitamin-a#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of vitamin A&quot;, section on 'Universal periodic distribution'</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Water-soluble vitamins</strong> &ndash; The concentration of water-soluble vitamins in milk also depends upon maternal diet and is reduced with vitamin deficiency. However, the concentration of water-soluble vitamins in milk is regulated so that it does not exceed an upper threshold even if the mother's intake of these vitamins is very high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/76-78\" class=\"abstract_t\">76-78</a>]. Vitamin C and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thiamine</a> (vitamin B1) concentrations, for example, remain below approximately 160 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> and 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L,</span> respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/76-78\" class=\"abstract_t\">76-78</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Vitamin content in milk is reduced in vitamin-deficient states and responds to supplementation. In women with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thiamine</a> deficiency (beriberi), for example, the thiamine content of their milk is low. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) concentration in milk also responds rapidly to changes in maternal intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Folate is preferentially secreted into milk at the expense of maternal reserves. However, milk concentrations are reduced in severe folate deficiency and increase after folate supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Vitamin B12</a> content in milk is also reduced with deficiency that may occur in vegans, malnourished women, women with latent pernicious anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>], and those who have undergone gastric bypass surgery. There are case reports of irreversible developmental delay in exclusively breastfed infants of B12 deficient mothers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mineral content</strong> &ndash; The levels of most inorganic components of human milk are independent of maternal diet or serum concentrations, although intake of some trace minerals affects milk levels.

In contrast, requirements for vitamins D and K, and the minerals calcium, fluoride, magnesium, and phosphorus do not differ between lactating and nonlactating states.

However, breast milk does not supply sufficient D and K to meet the infant's needs, and infants require supplementation. Vitamin K supplementation is routinely given to the infant at birth (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-vitamin-k#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of vitamin K&quot;, section on 'Prevention of vitamin K deficient bleeding in newborns'</a>). For the breastfed infant, Vitamin D can be provided as supplements, or the mother can be supplemented with large doses of vitamin D.

These requirements account for the amount of nutrient secreted into milk and allow for metabolic inefficiencies and individual variation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Calcium, phosphorus and magnesium</strong> &ndash; The RDA for calcium during lactation is 1000 mg daily for women 19 years and older, and 1300 mg daily for adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. These requirements are the same as for nonlactating women, although about 200 mg per day of calcium is secreted in milk. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The RDA for calcium is not increased during lactation because lactation-induced loss in bone mass is not prevented by increased calcium intake, and because the loss in bone mass is recovered after weaning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. As an example, in one report, loss of bone mass during lactation was similar with calcium supplementation (1 g per day) and placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/96-98\" class=\"abstract_t\">96-98</a>]. Recovery of bone loss occurred with resumption of menses and weaning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/99-101\" class=\"abstract_t\">99-101</a>]. Similarly, another randomized trial among postpartum women found no difference in bone mineral density with calcium supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. Moreover, the calcium content of the breast milk is not affected by maternal calcium intake because increased bone mobilization and decreased urinary excretion provide the calcium needed for milk production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/19,103\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,103</a>]. Intestinal calcium absorption does not appear to increase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/99,104\" class=\"abstract_t\">99,104</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Increased bone resorption and decreased urinary excretion of phosphorus and magnesium are also independent of dietary intake during lactation. Therefore, the dietary recommendations for phosphorus and magnesium are the same as for nonlactating women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Trace minerals</strong> </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Iron</strong> &ndash; The RDA for iron during lactation is 9 mg daily for women 19 years and older, and 10 mg daily for adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. This recommendation is less than the RDA for nonlactating women (18 mg daily) and adolescents (15 mg daily), because of lactation-induced amenorrhea, which reduces iron loss. Thus, postpartum use of a prenatal multivitamin (which provides about 30 mg of iron) is not necessary for a lactating woman unless she is known to be iron deficient. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Zinc, iodine and </strong><a href=\"topic.htm?path=selenium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">selenium</a> &ndash; The RDAs for these minerals are moderately higher during lactation than for nonlactating nonpregnant women, to compensate for their secretion into the breastmilk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Fish intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fish and shellfish contribute high-quality protein and other essential nutrients to the diet. Fish consumption by breastfeeding mothers has been suggested to be beneficial to the infant because fish contain large amounts of omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFA), including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which are important in brain development. However, available data are insufficient to demonstrate an association between maternal omega-3 fatty acid intake during lactation and subsequent cognitive function in their offspring. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=long-chain-polyunsaturated-fatty-acids-lcpufa-for-preterm-and-term-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) for preterm and term infants&quot;</a>.) </p><p>A potential disadvantage of fish intake is exposure to mercury. Nearly all fish and shellfish contain traces of mercury. For most people, the risk from mercury by eating fish and shellfish is not a health concern. Consumption of certain fish and shellfish by breastfeeding women may pose an increased risk to the breastfed infant's developing nervous system, since both inorganic and organic mercury are transferred from maternal serum to human milk. The mercury concentrations in human milk are highly variable and tend to decline between colostrum and mature milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>]. Mercury intake can be minimized by avoiding the intake of predatory fish (eg, pike, marlin, mackerel, tilefish, swordfish).</p><p>In considering the potential benefit of n-3 LCPUFA versus the risks of mercury exposure, the American Academy of Pediatrics concluded that the &quot;possible risk from intake of excessive mercury or other contaminants is offset by the neurobehavioral benefits of an adequate DHA intake&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. However, some pregnant and postpartum women may have concerns about fish safety, leading them to avoid fish altogether to avoid the possibility of mercury exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/107,108\" class=\"abstract_t\">107,108</a>]. Therefore, it is important to provide patients with guidance on choosing safe fish to consume during pregnancy and lactation.</p><p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued the following guidelines for fish intake for pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, and young children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>]. These recommendations allow the mother and her infant to receive some of the potential benefits of eating fish and shellfish, while limiting mercury intake.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breastfeeding mothers should eat 8 to 12 ounces a week (two average servings) of fish and shellfish that have lower concentrations of mercury. They include shrimp, canned light tuna, salmon, pollock, and catfish.

These diets should not be recommended; women should consume their usual diets during lactation. However, it is reasonable for a mother who already has a child with peanut allergy to consider avoiding peanuts while breastfeeding a subsequent child, since at least one study found an association, and peanut is not an essential food.

The amount of alcohol considered to be &quot;safe&quot; while breastfeeding is controversial. We suggest that a breastfeeding woman avoid exposing the infant to alcohol by waiting to nurse for two hours after a single serving of alcohol (12 ounces of beer, five ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of 80-proof liquor). If a woman drinks more than this amount, she should refrain from breastfeeding for an additional two hours for each serving of alcohol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-nutrition-during-lactation/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>]. It is not necessary to express and discard milk after consuming alcohol, unless the breasts become uncomfortably engorged before enough time has elapsed for the alcohol to leave her system. Heavy alcohol intake can impair judgement and child care abilities and should be avoided, regardless of how the infant is fed.

However, some young infants are sensitive to caffeine and become irritable or have difficulty sleeping, even with small amounts of caffeine.
