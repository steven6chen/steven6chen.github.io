It most often affects people older than 55.</p><p>In healthy people, old bone breaks down and new bone replaces it. This happens slowly throughout life. In people with Paget disease (also called &quot;Paget's disease&quot;) of bone, parts of some bones do not break down and regrow in the normal way. This can cause some of the bones to grow too big, form abnormal shapes, and be weaker than regular bones.</p><p>Paget disease can affect different bones in different people. The bones most often affected are the skull, spine, pelvis, and arm and leg bones. Paget disease does not spread from one bone to another.</p><p>There is also a type of breast cancer called Paget disease of the breast. This is <strong>not</strong> related to Paget disease of bone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H268263299\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of Paget disease of bone?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with Paget disease do not notice any symptoms. But some people do. Symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pain</strong> &ndash; Bones affected by Paget disease sometimes hurt. The disease can also cause other problems, such as arthritis (when the affected bone is near a joint, such as the knee or hip), weakness, or numbness (if the bone puts pressure on a nerve).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Changes in appearance</strong> &ndash; In some cases, the bones change so much that the changes are noticeable from the outside. For example, if the leg bones are affected, the changes might cause a limp or make the legs look curved. Paget disease of the skull can make the head grow bigger than normal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fractures</strong> &ndash; Bones affected by Paget disease are weaker than normal. This makes them more likely to fracture (break).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hearing loss</strong> &ndash; In some cases, Paget disease can affect the skull bone near the ears. This can lead to hearing loss.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H268263314\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you have pain or other problems with your bones, your doctor or nurse can help figure out what is going on.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H268263329\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for Paget disease of bone?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. There are a few different tests that your doctor or nurse can use to tell if you have Paget disease:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Blood test</strong> &ndash; People with Paget disease usually have a higher than normal level of a specific protein (called &quot;alkaline phosphatase&quot;) in the blood. A blood test can show this.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Imaging tests</strong> &ndash; Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body. Bone scans and X-rays are 2 types of imaging tests that doctors use to check for bone problems.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H268263344\"><span class=\"h1\">How is Paget disease of bone treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people with Paget disease do not need any treatment. But there are treatments that can help people who have symptoms. Even if you do not have any symptoms, your doctor might suggest treatment to keep your Paget disease from causing other problems.</p><p>Treatments can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medicines</strong> &ndash; There are medicines that can help prevent some of the bone problems caused by Paget disease. Some of these medicines come as pills, while others come as shots. If you start taking these medicines, your doctor or nurse will do blood tests every few months to see if they are working.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If you take these medicines, it is important to get plenty of calcium and vitamin D. Your doctor or nurse can help you figure out how much you need. Lots of foods and drinks have calcium and vitamin D (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79375\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79375 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Treatments for other problems</strong> &ndash; Some people with Paget disease also have related problems, such as arthritis or pinched nerves. If treating your Paget disease does not help with these problems, your doctor or nurse might suggest pain medicines, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol). Your doctor or nurse might also suggest that you use a cane or try physical therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Surgery</strong> (to replace a knee or hip) can also help some people with severe arthritis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H268263382\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. It might help to eat a healthy diet with plenty of calcium and vitamin D. Getting regular exercise can also help strengthen bones. Your doctor or nurse can help you figure out what kinds of exercise are safe for you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H268263397\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoarthritis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Osteoarthritis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-density-testing-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bone density testing (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fractures-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Fractures (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hip-replacement-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hip replacement (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=knee-replacement-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Knee replacement (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=paget-disease-of-bone-osteitis-deformans-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Paget disease of bone (osteitis deformans) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoarthritis-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Osteoarthritis symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoarthritis-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Osteoarthritis treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-hip-replacement-arthroplasty-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Total hip replacement (arthroplasty) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-knee-replacement-arthroplasty-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Total knee replacement (arthroplasty) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
