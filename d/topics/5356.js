Allowing the child to feed him or herself promotes and reinforces self-regulation of intake.</p><p>Key issues for toddlers and preschool children include making the transition to cup and utensil feeding, fluctuations in appetite, achieving adequate iron and zinc intake, avoiding overconsumption of juice and sweetened beverages, and developing routines for healthy eating and activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-toddlers-preschool-and-school-age-children/abstract/1,3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,4</a>]. Key issues for school-age children include adequate intake of fruits, vegetables, calcium, vitamin D, and fiber; avoidance of <span class=\"nowrap\">energy-rich/nutrient-poor</span> snacks (eg, salty snacks, cookies, sweetened beverages) and overconsumption of sugar-sweetened foods and beverages; and development of a healthy body image [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-toddlers-preschool-and-school-age-children/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>].</p><p>Children who have developmental delays may not master feeding skills in a timely fashion. Parents should understand that the prolonged use of a bottle or the persistence of finger feeding may be necessary to insure adequate dietary energy and nutrient intake.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Toddlers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During the second year of life, through the progressive acquisition of motor skills and eruption of the full complement of deciduous teeth, children learn to feed themselves independently and make the transition to a modified adult diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-toddlers-preschool-and-school-age-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Dietary preferences and patterns continue to be established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-toddlers-preschool-and-school-age-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The growth rate and appetite decrease after the first birthday. Toddlers may eat variable quantities at any given meal. They also may choose from a small variety of foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-toddlers-preschool-and-school-age-children/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. These behaviors are to be expected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-toddlers-preschool-and-school-age-children/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179339885\"><span class=\"h3\">Feeding development</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Feeding development during the second year includes acquisition of the following skills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-toddlers-preschool-and-school-age-children/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drinking from a cup &ndash; Weaning from the bottle should begin at 12 to 15 months of age. By 15 months of age, children can manage a cup by themselves but will continue to spill; by 18 to 24 months of age, cup manipulation is improved, and spills occur less frequently.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Toddlers should be completely transitioned from the bottle to the cup by two years of age (ideally by 15 to 18 months), and they should not sleep with a bottle. Drinking from a bottle predisposes to dental caries, particularly if the bottle is taken to bed or sipped throughout the day. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preventive-dental-care-and-counseling-for-infants-and-young-children#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preventive dental care and counseling for infants and young children&quot;, section on 'Dietary habits'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, supplying large volumes of caloric beverages in a bottle may lead either to overfeeding or to decreased solid food intake and undernutrition. Continuing to use a bottle at two years was associated with obesity at 5.5 years in a longitudinal cohort study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-toddlers-preschool-and-school-age-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Self-feeding &ndash; During the second half of the first year, infants learn to grasp food with their hands and then between the thumb and first finger; they can use their lips to remove food from a spoon. By 16 to 17 months of age, improved wrist rotation permits the transfer of food from a bowl to the mouth.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>By 24 months of age, most children are ready to consume an adult diet (with modifications to prevent choking). (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Choking'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179339902\"><span class=\"h3\">Feeding behaviors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The acquisition of healthy feeding behaviors is dependent upon the interaction of several factors. These include child-specific elements, such as developmental maturation, temperament, personal experiences, and medical needs, as well as environmental considerations, like family dynamics, ethnic dietary practices, and food accessibility. A feeding problem can result from any of these factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-toddlers-preschool-and-school-age-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Normal toddler feeding behaviors include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-toddlers-preschool-and-school-age-children/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Playing with food &ndash; Exploratory behaviors (touching, smelling, putting the food in the mouth and spitting it out) may precede acceptance or willingness to taste or swallow new foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-toddlers-preschool-and-school-age-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decrease in dietary variety (feeding &quot;jags&quot;) &ndash; Beginning at approximately two years of age, toddlers may become resistant to trying new foods; they may choose to eat only a small number of well-accepted favorites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-toddlers-preschool-and-school-age-children/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. It may be necessary to offer new foods several times (as many as 8 to 10) before concluding that the child will not accept them [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-toddlers-preschool-and-school-age-children/abstract/1,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11,12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Preschool children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By three to four years of age, children are better able to protect their airways and can safely consume the small, round, hard foods that previously posed a choking hazard. They can handle utensils and cups efficiently and can sit at the table for meals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-toddlers-preschool-and-school-age-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Preschool children are more aware of the feeding environment than younger children, and environmental cues affect their food selection and intake patterns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-toddlers-preschool-and-school-age-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Environmental cues include time of day, portion size, restriction of food or pressure to eat, the preferences and eating behaviors of others, and packaging (eg, the presence of licensed characters on the package) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-toddlers-preschool-and-school-age-children/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>Preschool children may have unpredictable interest in eating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-toddlers-preschool-and-school-age-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Their ability to sit at the table may be limited by their attention span. However, they should be encouraged to sit with the family for a reasonable period of time (eg, 15 to 20 minutes) during meals, even if they choose not to eat. Sitting with the family during meals provides an opportunity for caregivers to model healthy eating behaviors and choices.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">School-age children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>School-age children can understand basic nutrition concepts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-toddlers-preschool-and-school-age-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. They can help with meal planning, food preparation, and mealtime chores (eg, setting the table) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-toddlers-preschool-and-school-age-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>School-age children have more freedom over their food choices; many eat at least one meal per day away from home. Allowing them to participate in food choices at home and providing positive reinforcement when they make healthy choices may help them to make healthy choices away from home.</p><p>School-age children also are more aware of their body weight and shape than when they were younger. The food attitudes and choices of school-age children may be influenced (positively or negatively) by friends, nonfamily members, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the media [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-toddlers-preschool-and-school-age-children/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. Parents may need to balance potentially negative influences by increasing positive influences in the home (eg, by making healthy choices themselves during family meals, increasing reinforcement when the child makes healthy choices, and setting an example).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H611095888\"><span class=\"h1\">NUTRITIONAL REQUIREMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Energy and nutrient requirements for children vary depending upon age, sex, and activity level (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78274\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78274 \">table 1</a>). <a href=\"http://www.choosemyplate.gov/&amp;token=+nVJmPhZ7CoZ6P5TTscsQE1A6C1z46oKcQmDPakNLj4PEsVYKQKwZR6HpzTIaGyc&amp;TOPIC_ID=2866\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">ChooseMyPlate</a> is an interactive website that provides individual dietary guidance according to these parameters. (See <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Resources'</a> below.)</p><p>Energy intake is influenced by the number of meals and snacks that are eaten during the day, the energy density of foods consumed, and portion size. Children generally can self-regulate energy intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-toddlers-preschool-and-school-age-children/abstract/6,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,18</a>]. However, self-regulation may be overridden if eating behaviors are driven by factors other than hunger and fullness (eg, coercive feeding, restriction of intake, environmental cues to eat) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-toddlers-preschool-and-school-age-children/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Parents should provide a range of nutritious foods for meals and snacks, but children should be allowed to decide how much, if any, they eat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-toddlers-preschool-and-school-age-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Parents must be cognizant that peers and others outside the family greatly influence food choices of school-age children and adolescents.

Nondairy milk alternatives are not &quot;milk&quot; per se, but extracts derived from plant sources. Common alternative milks include soy, almond, rice, coconut, and hemp milks; newer alternative milks include quinoa, oat, potato, and mixed grain milks. Among the plant-based milks, soy milk has a nutrient profile that is most similar to cow milk and usually is fortified with calcium and vitamin D.

Achieving independence and mastery of feeding skills is an important developmental task of early childhood. It is normal for toddlers to eat variable quantities at any given meal, to become resistant to trying new foods, and to choose to eat a small number of favorite foods. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Toddlers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The feeding choices and behaviors of preschool children are largely influenced by environmental cues. It is important for preschool children to sit with the family during meal times (even if the child chooses not to eat) so that they can observe the eating behaviors and choices of family members.
