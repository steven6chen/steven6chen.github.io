Such athletes are susceptible to a number of shoulder and elbow injuries due to the stresses involved in throwing.</p><p>The treatment of throwing-related upper extremity injuries is reviewed here. The presentation and diagnosis of such injuries is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=throwing-injuries-of-the-upper-extremity-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-approach\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Throwing injuries of the upper extremity: Clinical presentation and diagnostic approach&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=throwing-injuries-biomechanics-and-mechanism-of-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Throwing injuries: Biomechanics and mechanism of injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179374576\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial treatment for most throwing injuries is relative rest. This involves significantly decreasing the number of throws performed by an athlete, or eliminating throwing altogether for a period. For a baseball pitcher or catcher, this may be as simple as changing positions, ideally to first base or designated hitter. For position players who do not throw as often, depending on the severity of the injury, a position change or elimination of throwing during practice may be required. Complete cessation of throwing is often necessary if an injury is severe.</p><p>Immobilization is rarely needed and may be detrimental. Pain control can generally be accomplished with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> or a short course of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The possible effects of NSAIDs on soft tissue healing are reviewed separately.

Patients with isolated rotator cuff pathology often respond well to physical therapy, including strengthening of the rotator cuff. Such exercises are described below. (See <a href=\"#H61393341\" class=\"local\">'Upper extremity strength exercises'</a> below.)</p><p>Throwers with labral pathology often require surgical treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/throwing-injuries-of-the-upper-extremity-treatment-follow-up-care-and-prevention/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

Important elements of treatment typically include strengthening the rotator cuff and scapular stabilizers and stretching the posterior shoulder capsule. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotator-cuff-tendinopathy#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rotator cuff tendinopathy&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p>Surgical referral should be obtained expeditiously for acute full thickness tears associated with weakness and for cases where the patient fails to improve with physical therapy. Significant retraction identified by diagnostic image also indicates a need for surgical referral. Physical therapy for patients with rotator cuff injuries but no surgical indications and the management of rotator cuff tears are discussed in detail separately.

After such injections, the athlete must refrain from throwing for five days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/throwing-injuries-of-the-upper-extremity-treatment-follow-up-care-and-prevention/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, the use of glucocorticoid injections to treat musculotendinous injury remains controversial.

However, many throwing athletes ultimately need surgical debridement or repair in order to return to sport. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=superior-labrum-anterior-posterior-slap-tears#H12727840\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Superior labrum anterior posterior (SLAP) tears&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179374607\"><span class=\"h3\">Glenohumeral internal rotation deficiency (GIRD)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with GIRD are managed nonoperatively.

Nonoperative treatment consists of rest from throwing, stretching the posterior shoulder capsule and pectoralis minor muscle, strengthening the posterior shoulder musculature, especially the subscapularis and serratus anterior, and glenohumeral joint mobilization. Useful stretches include the sleeper stretch and the cross-body adduction stretch (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F103152\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103152 \">figure 1</a>).

Bennett lesions are often asymptomatic and treatment is controversial. Some surgeons excise such lesions while others concentrate on correcting strength or biomechanical deficits around the shoulder. There is little published evidence to guide decision-making, and no study has compared operative to nonoperative treatment. In one surgical case series, 11 of 16 patients returned to baseball following arthroscopic resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/throwing-injuries-of-the-upper-extremity-treatment-follow-up-care-and-prevention/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. While Bennett lesions are often asymptomatic their presence suggests chronic loading of the posterior capsule. Thus, while athletes who are asymptomatic do not need to stop throwing, it would behoove them to start a prevention program similar to the one used to manage GIRD to protect the shoulder complex. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=throwing-injuries-of-the-upper-extremity-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-approach#H58516049\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Throwing injuries of the upper extremity: Clinical presentation and diagnostic approach&quot;, section on 'Shoulder injuries'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179374619\"><span class=\"h3\">Proximal humeral epiphysiolysis (&quot;Little League shoulder&quot;)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Little League shoulder is treated with rest and activity modification. Typically, symptoms resolve with two to three months of relative rest. During this period, clinicians should educate the patient and his or her parents, and coaches if possible, about appropriate rest between pitching episodes. The patient should participate in a strength program that includes both the core and lower extremities. A stretching program is especially important for athletes with motion limitations consistent with GIRD, as these athletes appear to be at increased risk for recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/throwing-injuries-of-the-upper-extremity-treatment-follow-up-care-and-prevention/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Prior to resuming pitching, the athlete should complete a return to throwing program. Often, a review of the athlete's biomechanics is useful, as many young throwers have a tendency to throw using primarily their arm and shoulder rather than generating power with their lower body.

Prior to embarking upon a rehabilitation program, an assessment of the athlete should be performed to identify possible sources of dysfunction.</p><p>An appropriate physical therapy program includes progressive mobility and strength exercises of uninjured structures (eg, lower extremity and trunk) based on identified needs. Gradually, exercises involving the injured extremity are introduced as symptoms abate and the primary injury heals. This is followed by the addition of a plyometric program that involves exercises such as throwing a weighted ball against a trampoline or with a partner to develop proprioception and strength. When the athlete manifests no tenderness, no pain to resisted motion or passive stretch, and no pain during or after performance of plyometric exercises, a progressive throwing program may be initiated. The exercises programs used in rehabilitation are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H61393384\" class=\"local\">'Exercise programs for rehabilitation and injury prevention in throwers'</a> below and <a href=\"#H18283180\" class=\"local\">'Stretching exercises'</a> below and <a href=\"#H18282646\" class=\"local\">'Strength, balance, and plyometric exercises for throwers'</a> below.)</p><p>Throwing programs for rehabilitation and injury prevention vary greatly and such components as maximum throwing distance, number of throws, and intensity of throwing are the source of ongoing debate. Biomechanical studies show that throwing mechanics and the stresses placed on the elbow and shoulder change as distance increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/throwing-injuries-of-the-upper-extremity-treatment-follow-up-care-and-prevention/abstract/4,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10</a>]. At 120 feet (37 m), players no longer throw with a &quot;down-hill&quot; trajectory and mechanics begin to change. At 180 feet (55 m), shoulder and elbow stresses begin to rise to potentially dangerous levels. Based on this data, we generally recommend that pitchers gradually move to a maximum distance of 120 feet (37 m) and position players to a maximum 150 to 180 feet (46 to 55 m) in long toss programs. A sample progressive throwing program for throwers who have recovered from an injury or are returning to sport after a layoff (eg, season playing a non-throwing sport) and are working towards a return to play is provided in the following table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F103155\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103155 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179374679\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H75985023\"><span class=\"h2\">Musculoskeletal injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, complications from throwing injuries primarily relate to the inability to return successfully to throwing activity and to early degenerative changes, in particular shoulder and elbow osteoarthritis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179374685\"><span class=\"h2\">Effort thrombosis/Paget-Schroetter syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications of thrombosis include post-thrombotic syndrome, which is characterized by persistent pain, heaviness of the limb, and chronic swelling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/throwing-injuries-of-the-upper-extremity-treatment-follow-up-care-and-prevention/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179374691\"><span class=\"h1\">RETURN TO SPORT OR WORK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, an athlete may return to throwing when he or she is asymptomatic, has regained full strength, and has successfully completed a well-designed return to throwing program.

Studies suggest that limiting the number of pitches thrown and the percentage of the year that an athlete is involved in throwing sports may decrease injury risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/throwing-injuries-of-the-upper-extremity-treatment-follow-up-care-and-prevention/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. USA Baseball and Major League Baseball have promulgated recommendations for limiting pitching volumes and types based on these and other studies, which can be found at the website in the following reference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/throwing-injuries-of-the-upper-extremity-treatment-follow-up-care-and-prevention/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>A number of biomechanical risk factors for elbow and shoulder injuries has been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/throwing-injuries-of-the-upper-extremity-treatment-follow-up-care-and-prevention/abstract/1,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16</a>]. By using motion analysis to evaluate a pitcher's throwing motions, clinicians can determine whether such factors are present and recommend modifications that may decrease the risk of injury. However, some pitchers may find that suggested changes in biomechanics cause changes in ball motion or velocity that reduce their effectiveness. Some of the more common biomechanical throwing errors that can place undue stress on the shoulder and elbow include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hooking the ball (early shoulder and elbow extension with wrist flexion) during arm cocking phase (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F103683\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103683 \">picture 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low shoulder abduction (dropped elbow) at time of foot contact (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F103686\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103686 \">picture 2</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive horizontal shoulder abduction at foot contact, and through early acceleration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F103684\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103684 \">picture 3</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Premature trunk rotation during initiation of acceleration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F103687\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103687 \">picture 4</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive elbow flexion at foot contact, moving to excessive elbow extension at ball release (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F103688\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103688 \">picture 5</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inadequate follow through (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F103689\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103689 \">picture 6</a>)</p><p/><p>While these flaws can often be spotted by trained professionals in &quot;real-time,&quot; video analysis often involving slow motion replay is necessary for a thorough assessment of throwing biomechanics.</p><p>In addition to avoiding overuse and biomechanical flaws, exercise programs designed to improve strength and maintain mobility are important for preventing throwing-related upper extremity injuries. While the importance of shoulder and arm strength is obvious to most throwing athletes, the importance of strong scapular stabilizers, trunk, and lower extremity muscles may not be. Thus, it is important to educate throwing athletes about the importance of these muscles and to provide appropriate strength and conditioning programs.</p><p>Most scapular and rotator cuff exercise programs for pitchers are modeled on the &quot;Thrower's 10 Program&quot; designed by James Andrews, MD and physical therapists Kevin Wilk and Michael Reinhold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/throwing-injuries-of-the-upper-extremity-treatment-follow-up-care-and-prevention/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. This program is designed to be one part of a year-round program of strength and mobility that targets the main muscles involved in throwing. An Advanced Thrower's 10 Program published in 2011 builds upon the original with the goal of coordinating the upper extremity with the core and lower extremity. This program incorporates exercises to develop single leg balance, trunk and abdominal strength, and ipsilateral musculature. Suggested exercise programs for throwers, including descriptions of the specific exercises used in these programs, are described below. Continual work to prevent dysfunction in the shoulder capsule remains an important element of all programs. (See <a href=\"#H61393384\" class=\"local\">'Exercise programs for rehabilitation and injury prevention in throwers'</a> below and <a href=\"#H18282646\" class=\"local\">'Strength, balance, and plyometric exercises for throwers'</a> below and <a href=\"#H18283180\" class=\"local\">'Stretching exercises'</a> below.)</p><p>The idiosyncratic biomechanical demands of pitching require specific adaptations that must be accounted for when designing training programs for throwers. As an example, while the ratio of shoulder internal rotation to external rotation is generally 3:2 in normal individuals and in many overhead athletes, healthy pitchers may reach a 4:3 ratio, while developing a &quot;posterior dominant&quot; shoulder (ie, one with greater external rotation) that may be more resistant to injury. Thus, strength exercises for the shoulder should be performed in a controlled manner and include some emphasis on the eccentric movement in order to mimic the demands of deceleration that occur following release of the ball when pitching.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63504392\"><span class=\"h1\">EXERCISE AND THROWING PROGRAMS FOR TREATMENT AND INJURY PREVENTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63504535\"><span class=\"h2\">Key principles for training and rehabilitation programs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the accompanying tables and text below, we provide a number of sample programs that may be used for treating throwing-related injuries of the upper extremity or for preventing such injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/throwing-injuries-of-the-upper-extremity-treatment-follow-up-care-and-prevention/abstract/17-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-21</a>].

However, not all young throwers have access to expert supervision. For such throwers, the following basic exercise program may be used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F103861\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103861 \">table 2</a>). The key principles described above apply to all throwers participating in such a program.

Stiffness of the posterior capsule limits glenohumeral motion and can make the shoulder susceptible to injury. Decreased internal rotation at 90 degrees of abduction has been found to increase the risk for elbow ulnar collateral ligament tears.</p><p>The following table provides a basic stretching program for the posterior capsule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F103152\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103152 \">figure 1</a>). The included stretches should be maintained at low intensity but for long duration, and they should be pain-free. Success with this program is gained through frequency, not intensity, of stretching. Therefore, at a minimum, the athlete should perform two to three stretches for 30 seconds each, repeating this during three to four sessions over the course of the day.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18283209\"><span class=\"h3\">Chest and forearm stretching program</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A basic static stretching program for throwers consists of the stretches used for the posterior capsule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F103152\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103152 \">figure 1</a>) and a few additional exercises primarily for the chest and forearms.</p><p>The chest stretches consist of two exercises, one performed while lying supine on a foam roller and the other performed in the corner of a room. Each is performed for three sets of 30 second holds. When performing the W stretch on the foam roller, make sure the foam roller is aligned in the center of the back under the spine. Place the arms in the <span class=\"nowrap\">90/90</span> position shown in the photograph, relax, and allow the elbows to drop towards the floor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F103159\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103159 \">picture 7</a>). When performing the corner W stretch, stand about 3 feet (1 m) from the corner of a room with one forearm on each wall at shoulder height and the elbows flexed to 90 degrees. Then relax and gradually lean into the corner.</p><p>To stretch the wrist flexors (volar forearm muscles), straighten the elbow of throwing arm with the palm facing up and then use the other hand to extend the wrist, thereby pushing the hand and fingers towards the ground (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F103693\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103693 \">picture 8</a>). To stretch the wrist extensors (dorsal forearm muscles), straighten the elbow of throwing arm but now with the palm facing down, and then use the other hand to flex the wrist, thereby pushing the hand and fingers towards the ground (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F81293\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81293 \">picture 9</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18282646\"><span class=\"h2\">Strength, balance, and plyometric exercises for throwers</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H61393341\"><span class=\"h3\">Upper extremity strength exercises</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The exercises described below are based on a program originally developed by experienced clinicians to help throwers develop strength in their rotator cuff, scapular stabilizer, and wrist flexor and extensor muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/throwing-injuries-of-the-upper-extremity-treatment-follow-up-care-and-prevention/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. We have modified the original program slightly to accommodate throwers who might not have access to particular equipment and to avoid potential problems posed by unsupervised exercises with elastic bands. The exercises below are used widely and based on sound biomechanical principles, but there are few rigorous controlled outcome studies of such programs.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shoulder abduction to 90 degrees: The thrower stands with their arm at their side, elbow straight, and palm against their lateral thigh. The thrower raises their arm laterally, keeping the palm down, until it reaches 90 degrees of lateral shoulder abduction (shoulder height) and then returns it to the starting position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F104000\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef104000 \">picture 10</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Scaption with external rotation: The thrower stands with their elbow straight and thumb up (ie, extended like a hitchhiker) and then raises their arm to shoulder level and no further. Movement occurs in the scapular plane, about 30 degrees anterior to the frontal plane. The thrower maintains the arm at shoulder height for 2 seconds and the slowly lowers it to the starting position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F104002\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef104002 \">picture 11</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Side-lying external rotation: The thrower lies on their uninvolved, or non-throwing, side. The throwing arm begins at the side of the body with the elbow bent to 90 degrees. While keeping the elbow of throwing arm fixed to their side, the thrower externally rotates their shoulder, holds the rotated position for 2 seconds, and then slowly lowers the arm to the starting position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F104005\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef104005 \">picture 12</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prone horizontal abduction (neutral): The thrower begins the exercise lying face down with their throwing arm hanging straight towards the floor. The thrower raises their arm to the side, keeping the palm facing down, until it is parallel to the floor, maintains this position for 2 seconds, and then slowly lowers their arm back to the starting position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F104120\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef104120 \">picture 13</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prone horizontal abduction (external rotation; 100 degrees shoulder abduction): The thrower begins the exercise laying face down with their throwing arm hanging straight towards the floor and thumb up (ie, extended like a hitchhiker). The thrower raises their arm to the side in a plane slightly superior to the shoulder until the arm is parallel to the floor. This position is held for 2 seconds, and then slowly lowered back to the starting position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F104008\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef104008 \">picture 14</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prone rowing: The thrower begins the exercise laying face down with their throwing arm hanging straight towards the floor, holding an appropriate dumbbell. Using a steady pace, the thrower raises the dumbbell to their chest, holds the position at the top for 2 seconds, and then gradually lowers the weight back to the starting position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F104010\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef104010 \">picture 15</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prone rowing into external rotation: The thrower begins the exercise laying face down with their throwing arm hanging straight towards the floor, holding an appropriate dumbbell. The thrower gradually raises their arm, while simultaneously bending their elbow, until the arm is at the level of the table and parallel to the floor. The forearm remains pointed towards the floor. After pausing for 1 second in this position, the thrower externally rotates their shoulder until the dumbbell is as the height of the table, while maintaining elbow flexion at 90 degrees. This position is held for 2 seconds, then the shoulder is gradually internally rotated, and the arm lowered back to the starting position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F104013\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef104013 \">picture 16</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Press-ups: While seated, the thrower firmly grasps both sides of the chair or table with their palms down. The hands should be directly below the shoulders. The thrower then slowly pushes downward through their hands to elevate their body off the chair or table, holds the elevated position for 2 seconds, and slowly lowers their body back to the starting position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F104014\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef104014 \">picture 17</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Push-ups: The thrower assumes a standard push-up position, with their hands below the level of their shoulders (ie, caudad) and no more than shoulder width apart. The thrower pushes up as high as possible, rolling shoulders forward (maximal scapular protraction) after their elbows are straight (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F104016\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef104016 \">picture 18</a>). If a standard push-up is too difficult or causes pain in the shoulder or elbow, the thrower may start with push-ups against a wall, and then gradually perform the exercise on increasingly lower surfaces (eg, chair, step), until it can be performed on the floor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F104017\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef104017 \">picture 19</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elbow flexion and extension</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Elbow flexion: From a standing position with their arm against their side and palm facing inward while holding an appropriate dumbbell, the thrower flexes their elbow, while gradually turning the palm upward.

We recommend that throwers perform core strengthening exercises two days per week and not on consecutive days. The following are suitable and commonly prescribed exercises:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Planks: The Thrower begins in a push-up position but supporting themselves on their forearms rather than hands, and then tightens their abdominal muscles while maintaining a neutral position with their lumbar spine (ie, no rounding and no hyperextension) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F100496\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100496 \">picture 24</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F100497\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100497 \">picture 25</a>). Initially, the position is held for 30 seconds. Three sets are performed. As the exercise becomes easier, time intervals are increased by 10 to 15 seconds, with a goal of 90 seconds.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Side planks: The thrower lies on their side braced by their left forearm, and then tightens their abdominal muscles while maintaining a neutral position with their lumbar spine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F100497\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100497 \">picture 25</a>). Initially, the position is held for 30 seconds. Three sets are performed. As the exercise becomes easier, time intervals are increased by 10 to 15 seconds, with a goal of 90 seconds.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bridges with leg extensions: The thrower lies on their back with knees bent and feet flat on the floor. The thrower then lifts their buttocks off the floor (bridge) by moving at the hips. Maintaining this position, the thrower raises one leg and extends their knee until the leg is straight, while keeping the abdominal muscles tight, and then flexes the knee and returns the foot to the floor. The thrower then performs the same maneuver using the opposite leg. Start with 10 repetitions per leg, and perform three sets (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F104022\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef104022 \">picture 26</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Draw in with leg extensions: The thrower lays supine with their hips and knees flexed to 90 degrees. Next, the thrower tightens their abdominal muscles and slowly extends one leg while maintaining the pelvis in a neutral position (ie, not allowing the lumbar spine to fall into lordosis). This position is held for 3 seconds, and then the leg is returned to the starting position. Start with 10 repetitions per leg, and perform three sets (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F104023\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef104023 \">picture 27</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Superman: While holding a 2 to 5 lb (1 to 2 kg) dumbbell in each hand, the thrower places their belly on a physio-ball in a prone position. Next, the thrower braces their abdominal muscles and brings their arms to a position of 90 degrees of shoulder abduction and external rotation, with the elbows flexed to 90 degrees, as if they were performing an overhead press. The thrower then presses the dumbbells by fully extending their arms outward, ending in a position resembling Superman's flying position. Return to the initial position by retracing the arm-path (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F104024\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef104024 \">picture 28</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Square steps: With an elastic band (eg, TheraBand) encircling both knees, stand in a half-squat position with toes pointing forward and a neutral spine. Take 10 steps to the left, 10 forward, 10 to the right, and 10 backward, making a square, while maintaining continuous tension in the band. Perform three sets of the full square.

Next, while maintaining a neutral spine, the thrower bends at the hip in order to bring the weight down to the planted foot, and then returns to the starting position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F103997\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103997 \">picture 30</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H79028942\"><span class=\"h3\">Plyometric exercises (Ballistic Six)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following plyometric exercises are used to develop strength and power in throwers while incorporating the entire throwing range of motion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/throwing-injuries-of-the-upper-extremity-treatment-follow-up-care-and-prevention/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].

Below are sample programs suitable for athletes who are returning to throwing after a layoff due to injury or participation in a non-throwing sport, throwing during their sport season, or throwing during their off season.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H61393465\"><span class=\"h3\">Terminology for throwing programs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All throwing programs use a progression of throwing velocities and distances to allow pitchers to improve their endurance and strength gradually. Common terms used to describe the different intensities of throwing include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lob toss: Throwing at short distance with minimal effort.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Soft toss: Throwing with a substantial arc to the ball's trajectory at approximately 50 to 60 percent of maximal effort or velocity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Firm toss: Throwing with a slight arc at approximately 80 to 85 percent of maximal effort or velocity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On line throwing: Throwing with virtually no arc at approximately 90 to 95 percent of maximal effort.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Game intensity throwing: Throwing with 95 percent effort or greater, as if in a game situation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H71737336\"><span class=\"h3\">Active warm-up program for shoulder, arm, and forearm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Controversy persists over the best approach to warming up throwers prior to competition. Most warm-up programs are based on tradition rather than evidence. Although not performed in baseball players, a well-designed, cluster-randomized trial involving 660 elite team handball players (a population of overhead throwing athletes with a shoulder injury profile similar to baseball pitchers) found that a preparticipation exercise program was effective in reducing shoulder injuries over the course of the seven month season (average prevalence 17 percent [95% CI 16-19] in the intervention group versus 23 percent [95% CI 21-26] in the control group) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/throwing-injuries-of-the-upper-extremity-treatment-follow-up-care-and-prevention/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p>The following figure describes a warm-up program that includes many of the exercises used in the team handball study, and that can be used by any pitcher or throwing athlete prior to competition or intensive throwing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F103153\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103153 \">figure 2</a>). Athletes should perform a light 5-minute general cardiovascular warm-up (eg, jogging, stationary cycling) prior to the throwing-specific warm-up. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2174063435\"><span class=\"h3\">Active cool-down program for shoulder, arm, and forearm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no consensus recommendations for post-throwing care, and little high-quality evidence to guide such recommendations. According to an observational study of a convenience sample of 20 professional baseball pitchers, a simple 1-minute mobility routine is effective for maintaining shoulder and elbow mobility following intensive throwing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/throwing-injuries-of-the-upper-extremity-treatment-follow-up-care-and-prevention/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. On the basis of these results and our clinical experience, we suggest the following approach to cooling down following intensive throwing (eg, game pitching): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perform light cardiovascular activity </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repeat warm-up exercises (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F103153\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103153 \">figure 2</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perform the &quot;two-out&quot; stretching program (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114666\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114666 \">picture 36</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H61393435\"><span class=\"h3\">Return to throwing program</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The progressive throwing program contained in the following table is primarily designed for pitchers and other throwers who have recovered from an injury or are returning to sport after a layoff (eg, season playing a non-throwing sport) and are working towards a return to play (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F103155\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103155 \">table 1</a>).

For a high-level baseball pitcher (eg, college or professional), a basic scheme for such a program might look like the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Saturday &ndash; Game day: Throw 80 to 110 pitches during competition (plus warm-up pitches).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sunday &ndash; Relative rest day: 30 to 40 minute light run; perform light core and rotator-cuff strengthening exercises.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monday &ndash; Long toss: 30 to 45 firm toss throws of 60 to 120 feet (18 to 36 m); 10 foul pole to foul pole sprints.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tuesday &ndash; Light soft toss throwing; light, flat-ground bullpen firm toss throwing to get the touch and feel of pitches, 15 to 30 throws of 30 to 45 feet; moderately challenging core and upper body strengthening; 10 acceleration sprints of 20 yards (18 m).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wednesday &ndash; Very light soft toss throwing: 30 throws of 30 feet (9 m); short sprints x 10 (eg, mound to first base: 90 feet, 27 m); core strength exercises.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thursday &ndash; 15 to 25 pitches in bullpen (for touch and feel) at 75 to 85 percent effort.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Friday &ndash; Very light soft toss throwing; 4 to 5 easy 30 yard (27 m) sprints.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Saturday &ndash; Game day.</p><p/><p>For a high school pitcher, a program with fewer throws, such as the following, might be used:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Saturday &ndash; Game day: Throw 70 to 80 pitches during competition (plus warm-up pitches). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sunday &ndash; Relative rest day: 30 to 40 minute light run; perform light core and rotator-cuff strengthening exercises. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monday &ndash; Long toss: 20 to 30 firm toss throws of 60 to 120 feet (18 to 36 m); 10 foul pole to foul pole sprints.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tuesday &ndash; Light warm-up soft toss throwing, 15 to 30 throws of 30 to 45 feet; basic core and upper body strengthening; 10 acceleration sprints of 20 yards (18 m).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wednesday &ndash; Very light soft toss throwing, 20 throws of 30 feet (9 m); short sprints x 10 (eg, mound to first base: 90 feet, 27 m); basic core strength exercises. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thursday &ndash; 15 to 25 firm toss pitches in bullpen (for touch and feel) at 75 to 85 percent effort. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Friday &ndash; Very light soft toss throwing; 4 to 5 easy 30 yard (27 m) sprints. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Saturday &ndash; Game day. </p><p/><p>For shorter throwing cycles, the clinician, athlete, and coaching staff can design appropriate weekly programming.

Pitchers usually begin such a program about six weeks prior to the start of organized team practices. A sample program is provided in the accompanying table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F103173\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103173 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>Off-season throwing sessions begin with approximately 5 minutes of light jogging or stationary cycling, easy sets of selected shoulder and upper extremity warm-up exercises, and 5 minutes of easy, lob tossing from 10 to 20 feet (3 to 6 m), before moving to the first prescribed distance of the day's program.</p><p>All prescribed throws should be firm but not overthrown. Over the course of a session, throwers should strive to make more precise, on line throws to the target. If the thrower cannot make firm throws at the set distance, the distance should be shortened. Throwers should not advance to the next distance until they are strong enough to complete their present level.</p><p>Pitchers should not throw off a mound until they are able to on line throw 120 feet for the designated time. Their goal is to be able to throw 25 to 30 pitches or 5 minutes of batting practice off the mound by the time they report for the start of organized practice. The goal for position players is to on line throw 120 feet for the designated time without discomfort. If at any time during the off-season program an athlete experiences pain or significant discomfort or other arm problems, they should contact their coach or trainer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55886137\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial treatment for most throwing injuries is relative or absolute rest.
