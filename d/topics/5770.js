The disorders include anorexia nervosa, <span class=\"nowrap\">avoidant/restrictive</span> food intake disorder, binge eating disorder, bulimia nervosa, pica, and rumination disorder. Diagnoses are based upon the American Psychiatric Association&rsquo;s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), which divides eating disorders into mutually exclusive categories that are based upon observed symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eating-disorders-overview-of-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Some diagnoses include a dimensional component that allows clinicians to specify the severity of illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eating-disorders-overview-of-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>Many aspects of the United States culture display an obsession with weight loss. Women's magazines often include stories about weight management, dieting, or how to tighten specific muscle groups. Models and actors often display a level of thinness that is difficult to attain, computer programs are used to alter photographs to make models look thinner, and some athletes relentlessly pursue a leaner body to enhance performance. This preoccupation to lose weight and tying self-esteem to a thin body type often extends to maturing adolescents. </p><p>This topic reviews the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and diagnosis of eating disorders, as well as their course of illness. Treatment of eating disorders, medical complications of eating disorders and their management, evaluation for medical complications and criteria for hospitalization, and the refeeding syndrome in anorexia nervosa are discussed separately. &#160; &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eating-disorders-overview-of-prevention-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eating disorders: Overview of prevention and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-medical-complications-and-their-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anorexia nervosa in adults and adolescents: Medical complications and their management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bulimia-nervosa-and-binge-eating-disorder-in-adults-medical-complications-and-their-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder in adults: Medical complications and their management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-evaluation-for-medical-complications-and-criteria-for-hospitalization-to-manage-these-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anorexia nervosa in adults: Evaluation for medical complications and criteria for hospitalization to manage these complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-the-refeeding-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anorexia nervosa in adults and adolescents: The refeeding syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194448554\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of screening instruments have been developed to identify patients with eating disorders.

A subsequent report that proposed and evaluated the ESP found that two abnormal responses to the ESP had a sensitivity and specificity of 100 and 71 percent, and that the sensitivity and specificity of SCOFF was lower (78 and 88 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eating-disorders-overview-of-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Further validation of both of these instruments is needed in broader populations.</p><p>The Eating Attitudes Test (EAT) is one of the most widely used self-report eating disorder instruments. The 26-item version has an accuracy rate of at least 90 percent when screening patients for the presence of an eating disorder, using a cutoff score of 20 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60963\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60963 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eating-disorders-overview-of-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders Patient Health Questionnaire is a brief instrument that both screens for and provides a categorical diagnosis for bulimia nervosa, as well as depressive, anxiety, alcohol, and somatoform disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eating-disorders-overview-of-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. It was specifically designed for use in primary care, is fully self-administered by the patient, has good diagnostic validity overall (sensitivity 75 percent, specificity 90 percent), excellent diagnostic validity for eating disorders (sensitivity 89 percent, specificity 96 percent), and the median physician time to review the results is one to two minutes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F82674\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82674 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Additional information about assessing patients with a possible diagnosis of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa is discussed separately.

In addition, diagnoses were based upon DSM-IV criteria, which are more restrictive than DSM-5 criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eating-disorders-overview-of-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

However, aggregation of anorexia nervosa in families suggests that genetic factors <span class=\"nowrap\">(and/or</span> environmental factors) may be involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eating-disorders-overview-of-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Other evidence supporting a genetic basis comes from a meta-analysis of genome wide association studies that included nearly 3500 individuals with a lifetime diagnosis of anorexia nervosa and nearly 11,000 controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eating-disorders-overview-of-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The study identified a significant locus on chromosome 12 (rs4622308) that was associated with anorexia nervosa. In addition, the study found positive genetic correlations between anorexia nervosa and neuroticism, schizophrenia, and educational attainment, suggesting that the same genes are involved across these phenotypes.</p><p>Multiple lines of evidence demonstrate altered brain function and structure in anorexia nervosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eating-disorders-overview-of-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, it is not clear whether the observed changes are etiologic and lead to anorexia nervosa, or whether the differences represent consequences of the disorder. Some of the functional and structural changes reverse following weight restoration, and others persist.</p><p>Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies suggest that abnormal functioning of different brain areas may contribute to onset of maintenance of anorexia nervosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eating-disorders-overview-of-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. As an example:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal functioning of corticolimbic circuits involved in appetite may contribute to anorexia nervosa. A study examined responses to tasting sucrose in patients who recovered from anorexia nervosa (n = 14) and in healthy controls (n = 14); blood flow in the right anterior insula was diminished in the patients, compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eating-disorders-overview-of-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. This suggests that restricted eating and weight loss may occur in anorexia nervosa because hunger signals are not accurately recognized (the anterior insula is thought to integrate sensory aspects of feeding). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second study examined inpatients with anorexia nervosa (n = 21) and healthy controls (n = 21) while they chose foods to eat, and found that activity in the dorsal striatum was greater among patients (who were less likely to choose high-fat foods) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eating-disorders-overview-of-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In addition, connectivity in fronto-striatal circuits differed between the groups. The dorsal striatum is involved in habitual behavior, and the study suggests that maladaptive food choices in anorexia nervosa are well established behaviors that are subserved by fronto-striatal networks. &#160; </p><p/><p>In addition, neuroimaging studies have shown structural brain changes in patients with anorexia nervosa.

Deficits have been found in dopaminergic function (dopamine is thought to be involved with eating behavior, motivation, and reward) and serotonergic function (serotonin may be involved with mood, impulse control, and obsessional behavior) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eating-disorders-overview-of-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H330632931\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features of anorexia nervosa are discussed separately.
