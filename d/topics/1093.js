Anxiety may present as a component of schizophrenia (particularly during an acute psychotic episode), a result of an underlying organic condition, a medication side effect, or a symptom of a co-occurring anxiety disorder. A thorough psychiatric examination, including a medical history and physical exam, and possibly intervention trials, may be needed to arrive at an accurate diagnosis. Treatment is based on this determination.</p><p>Posttraumatic stress disorder, which was redefined as a trauma-related disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), was previously studied in patients with co-occurring schizophrenia along with the anxiety disorders and is included in this topic.</p><p>The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of anxiety in patients with schizophrenia are discussed here. Anxiety disorders and schizophrenia as individual, non-comorbid conditions are discussed separately.

Schizophrenia spectrum disorders include schizophrenia, schizoaffective, schizophreniform and delusional disorders, and psychosis not otherwise specified. Mean prevalence rates were as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Social anxiety disorder (social phobia) &ndash; 14.9 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) &ndash; 12.4 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) &ndash; 12.1 percent</p><p/><p>Disorder rates across studies were markedly heterogeneous, largely due to use of different samples, diagnostic tools, and symptom-rating instruments. Mean rates were higher than those found for anxiety disorders in the general population. A study that included 327 patients with a chronic psychotic illness found that rates of an anxiety disorder were substantially higher among subjects diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder compared with schizophrenia (30.1 versus 16.7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-in-schizophrenia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>High levels of anxiety symptoms or the presence of an anxiety disorder have been associated with more severe positive symptoms of schizophrenia, social withdrawal, depression, hopelessness, increased suicide rates, and poorer functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-in-schizophrenia/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>Studies suggest that individuals with an early age of schizophrenia onset have a higher prevalence of anxiety than individuals with later onset. An analysis of data from the Epidemiologic Catchment Area study found that the presence of OCD, social phobia, or panic attacks were associated with a 2.6 to 3.5 increased odds of developing schizophrenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-in-schizophrenia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The presence of anxiety disorders in patients with first episode psychosis has been associated with poorer initial outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-in-schizophrenia/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H931451450\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Little is known regarding the pathophysiology of anxiety in schizophrenia. Imaging and post-mortem studies suggest that dysregulation of the major neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, glutamate, and serotonin may contribute to the presence of anxiety symptoms in schizophrenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-in-schizophrenia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A study identified gray matter volume decreases in patient with schizophrenia as compared with patients with schizophrenia and anxiety comorbidity, mostly noticeable in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Patients with schizophrenia and anxiety had volumes comparable to controls in this sample [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-in-schizophrenia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>Familial aggregation of obsessive-compulsive associated disorders (ie, obsessive-compulsive disorder [OCD], obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, and schizophrenia with comorbid obsessive symptoms) has been reported, such that relatives of schizophrenia patients with OCD have higher rates of anxiety disorders than relatives of schizophrenia probands without OCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-in-schizophrenia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This provides support for the validity of the OCD as a discrete comorbid entity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-in-schizophrenia/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. However, these findings are derived from small samples, and no comparable studies have been done for other anxiety disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H931451457\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &ldquo;anxiety&rdquo; can be used to describe several different mental phenomena: an affect, a symptom, or one of several syndromes. As an affect, anxiety performs an important signal function, alerting a person to danger. An example is the anxiety that alerts a person to look both ways before crossing the street. Anxiety is described as a symptom if it is experienced as unduly severe, in the absence of a sufficient cause, or lasts longer than is reasonable. In these cases, the unpleasant aspect of the anxious feeling has crossed a threshold that may lead a person to complain about it. Several syndromes, which can occur in patients with and without schizophrenia, present with anxiety in combination with other symptoms and associated impairment.</p><p>Symptoms of anxiety in patients with schizophrenia can be secondary to schizophrenia or independent of the psychotic disorder. Anxiety as a secondary symptom presents as a integral part of an active psychotic process. An example is a patient experiencing anxiety induced by terrifying hallucinations and delusions. Anxiety secondary to psychosis tends to improve as psychosis improves, eg, in response to antipsychotic treatment.</p><p>Anxiety may be present prior to the occurrence of schizophrenia or may persist in the absence of psychosis. Anxiety is often a feature in the prodrome leading to schizophrenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-in-schizophrenia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Studies suggests that anxiety is more prevalent in individuals with an earlier rather than later age of schizophrenia onset. (See <a href=\"#H931451443\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p>Anxiety can persist in the form of a syndrome or disorder that co-occurs independently from schizophrenia. Anxiety disorders and their distinguishing features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-in-schizophrenia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] are described below. Symptoms must occur to a degree causing significant distress or impairment for a disorder to be diagnosed. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) diagnostic criteria for each disorder are provided later in the topic. (See <a href=\"#H14700886\" class=\"local\">'Anxiety disorders'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Obsessive-compulsive disorder</strong> &ndash; Obsessions are persistent thoughts, ideas, or images that are perceived as senseless and intrusive; compulsions are urges or impulses for repetitive intentional, stereotyped behavior performed to alleviate the anxiety of the obsessions</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Panic disorder</strong> &ndash; Sudden onset of intense apprehension, fear, or terror accompanied by the abrupt development of specific affective, cognitive, and somatic symptoms (eg, palpitations, shortness of breath).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Posttraumatic stress disorder</strong> &ndash; Intrusive thoughts, nightmares and flashbacks of past traumatic events, avoidance of reminders of trauma, hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response and sleep disturbance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Specific phobia</strong> &ndash; Marked, irrational, and persistent fears of an object, activity, or situation, which is actively avoided or endured with intense anxiety or distress.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Social anxiety disorder</strong> &ndash; Unreasonable fear of embarrassment and humiliation in social or performance situations, leading to avoidance or intense anxiety.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Generalized anxiety disorder</strong> &ndash; Excessive anxiety and worry, fatigue, muscle tension, memory loss, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> insomnia.</p><p/><p>Specific anxiety disorders can present with different degrees of overlap with the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia, conceptually and possibly clinically. As examples, panic and paranoia both involve extreme states of fear. It has been proposed that the affective storm of anxiety during a panic attack can spur a patient with schizophrenia to scan his or her environment for danger that would justify the anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-in-schizophrenia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A paranoid individual may experience an exaggerated perception of danger in his or her environment as a complement to the extreme anxiety of the panic attack. Obsessions in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) can overlap conceptually with delusions in schizophrenia. It can be the inability of a patient to get a delusional thought off his or her mind, rather than the incorrectness of the thought, which causes much of the patient&rsquo;s suffering and functional impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-in-schizophrenia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24353553\"><span class=\"h1\">COURSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with anxiety predating schizophrenia have been found to have worse outcomes compared with patients with anxiety that developed as part of the psychotic process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-in-schizophrenia/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Studies of patients with co-occurring schizophrenia and anxiety disorders have found that patients with anxiety disorders had increased service utilization and hospitalization rates compared with patients without an anxiety disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-in-schizophrenia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24352241\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSMENT AND INITIAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with schizophrenia presenting with anxiety, the assessment and management of the anxiety are closely intertwined.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24355620\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessment and management are guided by the differential diagnosis.

It often requires meticulous history taking and clinical examination, optimally repeated over an extended period. This allows the clinician to determine, for example, whether the anxiety symptoms preceded or occurred independent of the psychotic symptoms.</p><p>Diagnosis of anxiety as a component of schizophrenia or an anxiety disorder is a diagnosis of exclusion, requiring the clinician to rule out organic factors, including medication side effects, as possible causes. Treatment interventions can be used to identify or rule out possible diagnoses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H921245\"><span class=\"h3\">Organic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many medical conditions can generate or mimic anxiety symptoms in patients with schizophrenia, including current medical illnesses, medication side effects, and substance use disorders, including withdrawal. See tables for medical conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58758\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58758 \">table 1</a>) and medications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F54521\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54521 \">table 2</a>) that can cause anxiety or symptoms that can be mistaken for anxiety. Individuals with schizophrenia have higher rates compared with the general population of such medical conditions, including cardiovascular and pulmonary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-in-schizophrenia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] and substance use disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-in-schizophrenia/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=co-occurring-schizophrenia-and-substance-use-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Co-occurring schizophrenia and substance use disorder: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A medical history, physical exam, review of the patient&rsquo;s medications and adherence, and laboratory testing are indicated to identify organic factors contributing to anxiety in patients with schizophrenia. A reasonable initial screening evaluation should include complete blood count and complete metabolic panel, a calcium level and thyroid function tests. If panic attacks are part of the differential diagnosis, concern about a potential pheochromocytoma or arrhythmia can prompt referral to a medical generalist or specialist. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10099996\"><span class=\"h3\">Side effects of antipsychotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anxiety and anxiety-like symptoms can occur as side effects of antipsychotic drugs, as in akathisia and obsessive-compulsive symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H920856\"><span class=\"h4\">Akathisia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Akathisia, an extrapyramidal symptom, may present with fidgetiness and marked internal angst akin to that reported in primary anxiety. Akathisia usually presents as motor restlessness with a compelling urge to move and an inability to sit still. Individuals with milder akathisia can describe a subjective feeling of restlessness but not show restless motor behavior. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-side-effect-management#H28219031\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia: Side effect management&quot;, section on 'Akathisia'</a>.)</p><p>First-line treatment for akathisia would be a decrease in the dose of the antipsychotic, if this can be done without exacerbating the psychotic disorder. If not feasible or ineffective, alternatives would be to change the antipsychotic to one less likely to cause akathisia, for instance switching from a first-generation antipsychotic medication to a second-generation antipsychotic medication, or switching to a less potent D2 blocker, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quetiapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quetiapine</a>. Other treatment options are to add a beta blocker (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> 20 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> in two divided doses), benzodiazepine (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a> 1 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> in two or three divided doses), or an adrenergic agonist (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a> 0.1 mg two or three times per day). Although common, the use of anticholinergics for the treatment of akathisia is not supported by data and should be avoided.</p><p>In cases where the diagnosis is uncertain, a trial of one of these interventions may be helpful to identify or rule out akathisia. (See <a href=\"#H10099996\" class=\"local\">'Side effects of antipsychotics'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=first-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-comparative-side-effects#H272233794\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;First-generation antipsychotic medications: Pharmacology, administration, and comparative side effects&quot;, section on 'Side effects'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H920864\"><span class=\"h4\">Obsessions and compulsions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>De novo obsessive and compulsive symptoms can accompany initiation of a second-generation antipsychotic drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-in-schizophrenia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Data suggest that the symptoms increase with antipsychotic dose. A temporal association between medication initiation (or dosage increase) and symptom onset can help to identify these side effects. However, the symptoms may develop weeks or months after medication initiation. The side effects are thought to be caused by the 5-HT2a antagonism of most second-generation antipsychotics.</p><p>The initial treatment of antipsychotic-induced obsessive and compulsive symptoms would be to decrease the antipsychotic medication, if this can be done without exacerbating the psychotic disorder. If this is not feasible or results in an inadequate response, the clinician should consider switching antipsychotics, possibly to one with less serotonin antagonism, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a>.</p><p>A change in antipsychotic medication may not be an option when the patient is taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a>, because this drug is typically used in patients with schizophrenic symptoms refractory to other antipsychotics. Case reports have suggested that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may reduce clozapine-induced obsessive and compulsive symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-in-schizophrenia/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. However, it should be noted that controlled studies are lacking, and the risks of additional side effects should be weighed against potential benefits of adding an SSRI. Some SSRIs (especially <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluvoxamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluvoxamine</a>) interact with clozapine, leading to toxic clozapine levels in some individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-in-schizophrenia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Fluvoxamine should be avoided in patients receiving clozapine. Other SSRIs should be used with caution and accompanied by monitoring of clozapine drug levels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake-inhibitors-snris-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs): Pharmacology, administration, and side effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10100005\"><span class=\"h3\">Symptoms of schizophrenia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To distinguish between anxiety as a symptom of schizophrenia and a distinct anxiety disorder, the clinician should be attuned to signs of temporal and clinical independence between the anxiety and psychotic symptoms. Examples follow:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a patient presenting with panic attacks, untriggered attacks are suggestive of a panic disorder, while panic accompanying the persecutory delusions of schizophrenia does not suggest an independent anxiety disorder.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A patient avoiding social situations may have a comorbid social anxiety disorder, suggested by the presence of discomfort with social exposure, or may lack interest in social situations, a common negative symptom of schizophrenia. Social avoidance can also be due to active positive symptoms. As an example, a patient might avoid social interaction for delusional fear of persecution. Such cases should be distinguished from comorbid social anxiety disorder.</p><p/><p>The presence of anxiety with an acute psychotic episode can increase the severity of the patient&rsquo;s clinical status and the difficulty of clinical management. In these cases, suggested steps are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluate the level of environmental and intrapsychic stress to which the patient is exposed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In cases where specific situations or interpersonal interactions are identified as closely related to the onset of anxiety, the patient may benefit from supportive therapeutic techniques, building of the patient&rsquo;s coping skills, or family interventions. A single observational trial was conducted of a short-term psychoeducational intervention provided to 46 family members of inpatients treated for schizophrenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-in-schizophrenia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Significant reductions were seen in patient anxiety, family burden, and patient-family relationship difficulties. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psychosocial-interventions-for-schizophrenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psychosocial interventions for schizophrenia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If psychosocial interventions are not an option, due to availability or patient preference, acute treatment with benzodiazepines (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a> 1 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> orally in two to three divided doses) can be beneficial and safe. The need for the medication for anxiety should be reevaluated once the psychotic exacerbation has improved.</p><p/><p>The phenomenological distinction between symptoms of anxiety disorders and psychotic symptoms can be often difficult to determine. During acute psychotic breaks it can be close to impossible. Examples of diagnostic challenges follow:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms of schizophrenia involving fearfulness or having &ldquo;bad thoughts&rdquo; can mimic core features of agoraphobia, panic disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The avoidance inherent in social anxiety can overlap phenomenologically with negative symptoms of schizophrenia (eg, a lack of interest in social activities).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obsessions in OCD can overlap with delusions in schizophrenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-in-schizophrenia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. It can be the inability of a psychotic patient to get delusional thoughts off his or her mind, rather than the content of the thought itself, that causes much of the patient&rsquo;s suffering and functional impairment.</p><p/><p>Trials of treatment can be useful in determining the diagnosis. Initiating an antipsychotic medication, or increasing an existing dose, is indicated to manage escalating anxiety and psychosis. If the anxiety resolves along with the psychosis, the response, suggests that the anxiety was a symptom of schizophrenia. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14700886\"><span class=\"h3\">Anxiety disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A co-occurring anxiety disorder can be diagnosed in patients with schizophrenia if the patient fully meets DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for the disorder and if the alternative possibilities, described above, have been ruled out [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-in-schizophrenia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. While this may be clear cut in some cases, it may be more ambiguous in others.
