While EGC is of particular importance for patient care in Eastern Asia, its significance extends to other disciplines and patient populations. Early gastric cancer has driven the development of novel imaging technologies (eg, magnification chromoendoscopy and narrow-band imaging) as well as advanced endoscopic resection techniques (eg, endoscopic mucosal resection and endoscopic submucosal dissection). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chromoendoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chromoendoscopy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnification-endoscopy#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Magnification endoscopy&quot;, section on 'Stomach'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-endoscopic-resection-of-gastrointestinal-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of endoscopic resection of gastrointestinal tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review the treatment as well as the natural history and prognosis of early gastric cancer.

Endoscopic resection, by either endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) or endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), is an option for carefully selected patients with EGC without known lymph node involvement who meet specific criteria (ie, have a sufficiently low risk for nodal metastases that endoscopic resection alone is likely to be curative). The general indications for endoscopic resection is a mucosal tumor without ulceration, &lt;20 mm in diameter, differentiated histology, and without known lymphovascular invasion. Patients who do not meet the criteria are referred for gastrectomy (which includes resection of the regional nodes), which is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of invasive gastric cancer&quot;, section on 'Extent of lymph node dissection'</a>.)</p><p>Proper staging is crucial for determining which patients are potential candidates for endoscopic resection. The staging of early gastric cancer, including the evaluation of regional lymph nodes for metastatic disease, is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=early-gastric-cancer-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging#H3186308429\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Early gastric cancer: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging&quot;, section on 'Staging'</a>.)</p><p>All patients, regardless of approach, should be evaluated for <em>H. pylori</em> infection and treated if there is evidence of infection.

In our view, the use of expanded criteria for endoscopic management should be considered investigational, and limited to centers of excellence. </p><p>There are no randomized trials comparing endoscopic versus surgical management of early gastric cancer. The data comparing outcomes in patients treated with endoscopic resection with those treated with gastrectomy suggest similar clinical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-gastric-cancer-treatment-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In a matched cohort study, there were no differences between the treatments with regard to mortality, recurrence rates, or complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-gastric-cancer-treatment-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, patients treated with endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) had a higher risk of metachronous gastric cancers, though all were successfully treated. Patients in the EMR group had shorter median hospital stays (8 versus 15 days) and lower costs of care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H757935977\"><span class=\"h3\">Standard and expanded criteria for endoscopic resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The general guidelines for the selection of patients with early gastric cancer who are appropriate for curative endoscopic resection with EMR or ESD are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-gastric-cancer-treatment-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High probability of en bloc resection</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tumor histology</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Intestinal type adenocarcinoma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tumor confined to the mucosa</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Absence of venous or lymphatic invasion</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tumor size and morphology</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Less than 20 mm in diameter, without ulceration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Less than 10 mm in diameter if Paris classification IIb or IIc (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F50239\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50239 \">table 1</a>)</p><p/><p>Expansion of the criteria was proposed by centers in Eastern Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-gastric-cancer-treatment-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. In our view, expanded criteria for curative endoscopic resection of intestinal type, early gastric cancer should be still considered investigational, be limited to the following categories, and restricted to centers of excellence:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mucosal tumors of any size, differentiated type without ulceration </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mucosal tumors less than 30 mm in size, differentiated type, with ulceration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mucosal tumors 20 mm in size or smaller, undifferentiated type, without ulceration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Submucosal tumors less than 30 mm confined to the upper 0.5 mm of the submucosa without lymphovascular invasion</p><p/><p>Patients meeting the expanded criteria are at lower risk of lymph node metastases compared with patients who do not meet them. However, patients meeting expanded criteria are at an increased risk of lymph node metastases compared with those who meet standard criteria, but rates are still low (2 versus 4 percent in one study ) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-gastric-cancer-treatment-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/8,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12,13</a>]. For patients who meet the expanded criteria, and wish to avoid surgery, removal of the tumor using ESD (rather than EMR) is generally preferred because ESD is able to achieve a deeper resection margin and en bloc resection. In addition, endoscopic resection may also serve as an excisional biopsy for improved staging. (See <a href=\"#H757935998\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopic submucosal dissection'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=early-gastric-cancer-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging#H3546611353\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Early gastric cancer: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging&quot;, section on 'Lymph node metastases in EGC'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H757935984\"><span class=\"h3\">Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is an alternative to surgery and is often the procedure of choice for patients who meet the standard criteria for endoscopic resection of an early gastric cancer. Technical aspects related to EMR are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H757935977\" class=\"local\">'Standard and expanded criteria for endoscopic resection'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-endoscopic-resection-of-gastrointestinal-tumors#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of endoscopic resection of gastrointestinal tumors&quot;, section on 'Endoscopic resection techniques'</a>.) Is this still true in view of the meta-analysis added above? </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2050414193\"><span class=\"h4\">Initial treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies have shown high survival and cure rates in patients with early gastric cancer who undergo EMR. In a Japanese report of 131 patients with differentiated mucosal early gastric cancer less than 2 cm, the 5- and 10-year overall survival rates were 84 and 64 percent, respectively. The disease-specific survival rates at both 5- and 10-year follow-up were 99 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-gastric-cancer-treatment-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In one of the larger series from Europe that included 39 patients with small tumors at low risk of recurrence, 97 percent of patients achieved remission after initial treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-gastric-cancer-treatment-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, recurrent or metachronous lesions developed in 11 patients (29 percent) during a mean of 57 months of follow-up; all were treated successfully with repeat endoscopic therapy.</p><p>Complications of EMR include bleeding and perforation, though in experienced hands, EMR is a safe procedure that can be performed on outpatients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-endoscopic-resection-of-gastrointestinal-tumors#H1942073\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of endoscopic resection of gastrointestinal tumors&quot;, section on 'Adverse events'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H801734192\"><span class=\"h4\">Positive margins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Not all patients with tumor-positive resection margins after EMR will have residual tumor or tumor recurrence. The best way to manage patients with only positive lateral margins is controversial, although case series suggest that patients with positive lateral margins but without positive vertical margins, submucosal invasion, or lymphovascular invasion can be managed with further endoscopic therapy rather than surgery. Patients with positive vertical margins, submucosal invasion, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lymphovascular invasion, are generally referred for surgery, depending upon comorbidities and patient wishes.</p><p>In a study of 726 patients treated by EMR, 348 (48 percent) had incomplete resections, 309 (89 percent) of whom had only positive lateral margins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-gastric-cancer-treatment-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Of these 309 patients, 288 (93 percent) were followed endoscopically (with or without additional endoscopic treatment) with no recurrences. Among the remaining 21 patients who underwent gastrectomy, none had positive lymph nodes. Of the 39 patients in the higher-risk group (positive vertical margins or <span class=\"nowrap\">submucosal/lymphovascular</span> invasion), 24 underwent gastrectomy. In this group, four patients (17 percent) had positive lymph nodes at surgery. In a study of 102 Korean patients with positive lateral or vertical resection margins, residual tumor was detected in 17 of 46 (37 percent) of those who underwent immediate additional endoscopic or surgical resection; tumor recurrence was seen in 17 of 56 (30 percent) who did not undergo immediate therapy but were followed endoscopically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-gastric-cancer-treatment-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. On multivariable analysis, the only independent risk factor for residual <span class=\"nowrap\">tumor/tumor</span> recurrence was the length of the lateral resection margin with tumor involvement. </p><p>Assessing the completeness of resection is more difficult in patients who have their tumors removed piecemeal compared with those who have an en bloc resection, and patients undergoing piecemeal resection are at increased risk of recurrence. In a 10-year follow-up study of 149 patients with early gastric cancer who underwent EMR in Japan, the tumors were removed en bloc in 66 cases and piecemeal in 83 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-gastric-cancer-treatment-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. None of the patients with an en bloc resection had a recurrence. Of the patients with piecemeal resections, nine (11 percent) underwent surgery for positive margins. Recurrences were noted in 21 of the 74 patients (28 percent) who did not undergo surgery following piecemeal resection and were more common among those with unclear lateral margins (adjusted hazard ratio 1.6; 95% CI 1.1-2.4). The recurrences were treated with surgery (eight patients) or with additional endoscopic therapy (13 patients). Despite the 28 percent recurrence rate in patients who underwent piecemeal resection, there were no deaths due to gastric cancer during the 10-year follow-up period. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H757935998\"><span class=\"h3\">Endoscopic submucosal dissection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ESD is a specialized endoscopic resection technique that uses a modified needle knife to remove the lesion by dissecting through the submucosa; it offers the potential to remove mucosal and submucosal tumors en bloc (ie, in one piece) irrespective of size of the lesion. ESD is an emerging approach for treatment of early gastric cancer, and most experience is found in specialized centers in eastern Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-gastric-cancer-treatment-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2231185036\"><span class=\"h4\">Initial treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ESD permits en bloc resection of larger tumors than can be treated with EMR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-gastric-cancer-treatment-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/20-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-27</a>]. As noted above, larger tumors are at higher risk of requiring piecemeal resection with EMR, which is associated with higher recurrence rates. ESD also permits a deeper resection margin in patients with submucosal involvement who are candidates for endoscopic resection. ESD has also been combined with laparoscopic sentinel lymph dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-gastric-cancer-treatment-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H757935977\" class=\"local\">'Standard and expanded criteria for endoscopic resection'</a> above.)</p><p>ESD involves a five step process: marking, injection, incision, dissection, and en bloc retrieval. Various types of endoscopic electrosurgical needle knives are used to incise mucosa surrounding the tumor. The mucosa is subsequently dissected away from the underlying submucosa, and the entire tumor is removed en bloc. ESD is more technically challenging than EMR and, for the most part, ESD is performed in high-volume referral centers. While the technique has shown promise in highly experienced hands, complications including bleeding and perforation have been described. English-language publications that included &gt;300 ESD cases suggest that major complications include: perforation (1 to 5 percent), delayed perforation (0.5 percent), delayed bleeding (3.6 to 16 percent), stenosis (0.7 to 2 percent overall, with rates up to 17 and 7 percent for cardia and peripyloric resections, respectively), and aspiration pneumonia (0.8 to 2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-gastric-cancer-treatment-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/30-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-35</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-endoscopic-resection-of-gastrointestinal-tumors#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of endoscopic resection of gastrointestinal tumors&quot;, section on 'Endoscopic submucosal dissection'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3809646901\"><span class=\"h5\">ESD versus EMR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While ESD requires more procedure time, endoscopic skill and expertise in addition to posing greater risk compared with EMR, ESD is more likely to result in complete resection of early gastric cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-gastric-cancer-treatment-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]; outside of the United States, ESD is preferred over EMR in some guidelines for treatment of early superficial gastric tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-gastric-cancer-treatment-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In the United States, experience with EMR in the gastrointestinal tract continues to develop while ESD experience is lagging. </p><p>In a meta-analysis of 10 observational studies including over 4300 lesions, patients treated with ESD were more likely to have en-bloc resection or complete histologic resection compared with patients treated with EMR (OR 9.7, 95% 7.7-12.1 and OR 5.7, 95% 2.9-11.0, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-gastric-cancer-treatment-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The likelihood of local recurrence was lower in patients treated with ESD compared with EMR (OR 0.09, 95% 0.05-0.17). The risk of perforation was higher in patients treated with ESD compared with EMR (OR 4.7, 95% 2.8-7.9), while the risk of bleeding was not significantly different between the two groups. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-endoscopic-resection-of-gastrointestinal-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of endoscopic resection of gastrointestinal tumors&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4139892254\"><span class=\"h4\">Positive margins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some studies suggest that gastrectomy should be considered for patients who are surgical candidates and who have residual cancer present at the lateral or vertical resection margins following ESD. This was illustrated in a study that examined 118 patients who underwent gastrectomy following incomplete ESD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-gastric-cancer-treatment-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. ESD was considered incomplete if there was residual cancer at the ESD margin, invasion of the submucosa or muscularis propria by tumor, lymphatic invasion, or an undifferentiated cell type. A total of 27 patients (23 percent) had residual cancer at the ESD margin, and 29 patients (25 percent) had residual cancer in the gastrectomy specimen. Patients with a tumor present at the lateral margin of the ESD specimen had a particularly high rate of residual tumor (63 percent, hazard ratio 13; 95% CI 3.8, 44). (See <a href=\"#H757935984\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR)'</a> above.)</p><p>On the other hand, good outcomes among patients with positive lateral margins (but without other criteria for an incomplete resection) have been seen when they are followed with close observation, rather than gastrectomy. In a series of 77 patients who had positive lateral margins following ESD who were followed closely after ESD, locally recurrent cancer was found in 10 patients (13 percent) after a median follow-up of 60 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-gastric-cancer-treatment-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. On multivariable analysis, a positive lateral margin &le;6 mm was associated with an increased risk of recurrence (hazard ratio 21; 95% CI 5.2-83 percent). Eight patients were managed with ESD and two underwent gastrectomy. There were no deaths due to gastric cancer, and the overall five-year survival rate was 94 percent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2767410635\"><span class=\"h3\">Managing noncurative resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to positive margins, there are other definitions of a noncurative endoscopic resection, including submucosal involvement, lymphovascular invasion, and poorly differentiated histology. The goal of endoscopic therapy is en bloc resection, but noncurative resection remains a challenge and there is no standard approach for managing these patients. Any endoscopic resection that does not meet the expanded criteria is a noncurative resection and typically, gastrectomy has been recommended, especially for tumors with positive vertical margins <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> with submucosal involvement or lymphovascular invasion, which are associated with a higher risk for lymph node metastases. (See <a href=\"#H757935977\" class=\"local\">'Standard and expanded criteria for endoscopic resection'</a> above.) </p><p>However, some patients with noncurative resection are not good surgical candidates or wish to avoid further invasive intervention. Risk factors that predict lymph node metastasis have been identified that may help treatment decisions in these patients. In a study of 321 patients who had gastrectomy and lymph node dissection after noncurative endoscopic resection for early gastric cancer, 23 (7 percent) of patients had lymph node metastasis (LNM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-gastric-cancer-treatment-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Risk factors associated with LNM included lymphovascular invasion (OR 8.7, 95% CI 2.9-26.8), positive vertical margins (OR 3.8, 95% CI 1.4-9.8) and female sex (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.0-6.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-gastric-cancer-treatment-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Despite these data, additional treatment may provide few benefits to patients who do not have a long life expectancy. In a single center study of 159 patients who underwent noncurative endoscopic resection but without additional treatment, three- and five-year survival rates were 83 and 77 percent, respectively, although rates were lower for those with lymphovascular invasion (62 and 42 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-gastric-cancer-treatment-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Among patients undergoing gastrectomy, studies have looked at performing laparoscopic lymph node dissection in patients with negative margins after ESD but noncurative resection based upon other factors (eg, undifferentiated histology, presence of lymphovascular or submucosal invasion). Currently, gastrectomy with removal of perigastric lymph nodes is recommended for such patients, but small studies suggest that laparoscopic lymph node dissection without gastrectomy may be a reasonable alternative. In a study of 21 patients with negative margins but with risk factor for lymph node metastases, lymph node dissection revealed metastases in two patients (10 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-gastric-cancer-treatment-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The patients with lymph node metastases were offered gastrectomy, but declined additional treatment. There were no local recurrences in any of the 21 patients during a median follow-up of 61 months, though two patients developed metachronous early gastric cancers and were again treated with ESD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H757936012\"><span class=\"h3\">Other endoscopic modalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other endoscopic modalities have been investigated but do not have an established role in the treatment of early gastric cancer.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=early-gastric-cancer-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging#H4780994\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Early gastric cancer: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging&quot;, section on 'Introduction'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that patients with known or suspected lymph node metastases be referred for gastrectomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Gastrectomy with removal of perigastric lymph nodes permits the evaluation and removal of involved lymph nodes, which is important because lymph node metastases are associated with tumor recurrence. (See <a href=\"#H757936019\" class=\"local\">'Gastrectomy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H757936061\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis with lymph node involvement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients without suspected lymph node involvement who meet the standard criteria for endoscopic resection, we suggest endoscopic resection rather than gastrectomy, provided that there is local expertise in the endoscopic resection techniques (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The indication for endoscopic resection is a mucosal tumor without ulceration, size &lt;20 mm in diameter, intestinal histology, and without known lymphovascular invasion. In our view, the use of expanded criteria for endoscopic management should be considered investigational, and limited to centers of excellence. (See <a href=\"#H757935977\" class=\"local\">'Standard and expanded criteria for endoscopic resection'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Endoscopic resection is associated with less treatment-related morbidity than gastrectomy and data suggest similar outcomes for appropriately selected patients with early gastric cancer. (See <a href=\"#H757935970\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopic therapies'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is imperative that a thorough evaluation for involved lymph nodes be performed prior to endoscopic therapy to determine if endoscopic resection is an appropriate treatment option. This evaluation is often done with endoscopic ultrasound. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=early-gastric-cancer-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Early gastric cancer: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Choice of specific procedure (endoscopic mucosal resection or endoscopic submucosal dissection) will depend upon the size of the early gastric cancer, the depth of tumor invasion, and the preferences of the endoscopist performing the procedure. Gastrectomy with removal of perigastric lymph nodes is a reasonable alternative for patients who are willing to accept the increased morbidity associated with gastrectomy in order to have a more definitive procedure. (See <a href=\"#H757935970\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopic therapies'</a> above and <a href=\"#H757936019\" class=\"local\">'Gastrectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with early gastric cancer who have an incomplete endoscopic resection with positive vertical margins, piecemeal endoscopic resection, lymphovascular invasion, or submucosal involvement not meeting the expanded criteria for endoscopic resection, we recommend gastrectomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Patients with incomplete resections and only positive lateral margins may be considered for repeat endoscopic resection if there is no evidence of positive vertical margins, lymphovascular invasion, or submucosal involvement. (See <a href=\"#H757935984\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR)'</a> above and <a href=\"#H757935998\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopic submucosal dissection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend gastrectomy for patients with early gastric cancer who do not meet standard or expanded criteria for endoscopic resection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Patients who do not meet criteria for endoscopic resection are at increased risk for lymph node metastases, which are associated with tumor recurrence. Gastrectomy with removal of perigastric lymph nodes permits the evaluation and removal of involved lymph nodes. (See <a href=\"#H757935977\" class=\"local\">'Standard and expanded criteria for endoscopic resection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laparoscopic gastrectomy is feasible and safe when conducted by surgeons experienced with the technique. Although this approach is clearly associated with a reduction in morbidity compared with open gastrectomy, additional data from high-quality comparative trials with long-term follow-up are needed before it can be confidently concluded that oncologic outcomes are comparable. (See <a href=\"#H757936019\" class=\"local\">'Gastrectomy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> eradication therapy for patients with early gastric cancer who are found to be infected (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Treatment is important because <em>H. pylori</em> infection is associated with the development metachronous gastric cancer. In the event of negative biopsies for <em>H. pylori</em>, infection status should be determined with serology, as <em>H. pylori</em> organism loads may decrease with the onset of precancerous lesions and adenocarcinoma, thereby reducing biopsy sensitivity. (See <a href=\"#H757936026\" class=\"local\">'Helicobacter pylori infection'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-gastrointestinal-malignancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Association between Helicobacter pylori infection and gastrointestinal malignancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-gastric-cancer-treatment-natural-history-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Choi KS, Jung HY, Choi KD, et al.
