Unfortunately, because of the late presentation, only 15 to 20 percent of patients are candidates for pancreatectomy. Furthermore, prognosis is poor, even after a complete resection. Five-year survival after margin-negative (R0) pancreaticoduodenectomy is approximately 30 percent for node-negative and 10 percent for node-positive disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111137\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111137 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Of the several subtypes of ductal adenocarcinoma, most share a similar poor long-term prognosis, with the exception of colloid carcinomas, which have a better prognosis. The more inclusive term &quot;exocrine pancreatic neoplasms&quot; includes all tumors that are related to the pancreatic ductal and acinar cells and their stem cells (including pancreatoblastoma), and is preferred. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of exocrine pancreatic neoplasms&quot;</a>.)</p><p>More than 95 percent of malignant neoplasms of the pancreas arise from the exocrine elements. Neoplasms arising from the endocrine pancreas (ie, pancreatic neuroendocrine [islet cell] tumors) comprise no more than 5 percent of pancreatic neoplasms; their clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging is addressed elsewhere.

In a multi-institutional series of 185 patients with exocrine pancreatic cancer diagnosed over a three-year period (62 percent involving the head of the gland, 10 percent body, 6 percent tail, and the remainder not determined), the most frequent symptoms at diagnosis were [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asthenia &ndash; 86 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss &ndash; 85 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anorexia &ndash; 83 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal pain &ndash; 79 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epigastric pain &ndash; 71 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dark urine &ndash; 59 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Jaundice &ndash; 56 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea &ndash; 51 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Back pain &ndash; 49 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea &ndash; 44 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomiting &ndash; 33 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Steatorrhea &ndash; 25 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thrombophlebitis &ndash; 3 percent</p><p/><p>The most frequent signs were:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Jaundice &ndash; 55 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatomegaly &ndash; 39 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Right upper quadrant mass &ndash; 15 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cachexia &ndash; 13 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Courvoisier's sign (nontender but palpable distended gallbladder at the right costal margin) &ndash; 13 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epigastric mass &ndash; 9 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ascites &ndash; 5 percent</p><p/><p>The initial presentation of pancreatic cancer varies according to tumor location. Approximately 60 to 70 percent of exocrine pancreatic cancers are localized to the head of the pancreas, while 20 to 25 percent are in the <span class=\"nowrap\">body/tail</span> and the remainder involve the whole organ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Compared with tumors in the body and tail of the gland, pancreatic head tumors more often present with jaundice, steatorrhea, and weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/2,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,5</a>]. As an example, in the above noted series, jaundice was present in 73 percent of the 114 patients with a tumor located in the head of the pancreas, compared with 11 percent of 19 body lesions, and none of the 11 tail lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Steatorrhea was present in 28 percent of the patients with pancreatic head lesions versus 11 percent of those with body, and none of those with tail lesions. Steatorrhea is attributable to loss of the pancreas&rsquo;s ability to secrete fat-digesting enzymes or to blockage of the main pancreatic duct.</p><p>Pain is one of the most frequently reported symptoms, even with small (&lt;2 cm) pancreatic cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. The pain associated with pancreatic cancer is usually insidious in onset, and has been present for one to two months at the time of presentation. It has a typical gnawing visceral quality, and is generally epigastric, radiating to the sides <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> straight through to the back. It may be intermittent and made worse by eating or lying supine. It is frequently worse at night. Lying in a curled or fetal position may improve the pain. Severe back pain should raise suspicion for a tumor arising in the body and tail of the pancreas. Rarely, pain develops very acutely, as a result of an episode of acute pancreatitis due to tumoral occlusion of the main pancreatic duct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of acute pancreatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Jaundice, which is usually progressive, is most often due to obstruction of the common bile duct by a mass in the head of the pancreas, causing hyperbilirubinemia. Jaundice may be accompanied by pruritus, darkening of the urine, and pale stools. Hyperbilirubinemia is characteristically of the cholestatic type, with a predominant increase in the conjugated fraction of bilirubin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-the-adult-with-jaundice-or-asymptomatic-hyperbilirubinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to the adult with jaundice or asymptomatic hyperbilirubinemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-causes-of-jaundice-or-asymptomatic-hyperbilirubinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and causes of jaundice or asymptomatic hyperbilirubinemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Jaundice is a relatively early sign in tumors arising from the pancreatic head, and pancreatic tumors that present with painless jaundice have been ascribed a relatively more favorable prognosis compared with those that present with pain and obstructive jaundice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/4,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9</a>]. Jaundice secondary to a tumor in the body or tail typically occurs later in the course of the disease, and may be secondary to liver metastases.</p><p>A recent onset of atypical diabetes mellitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>] may be noted. Several studies have addressed whether earlier detection of nonspecific signs of an evolving pancreatic neoplasm (particularly in adults with new-onset diabetes mellitus) might improve resectability and overall outcomes, but the results are inconclusive. Screening for pancreatic cancer in adults with new onset diabetes mellitus is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-nonfamilial-risk-factors-for-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and nonfamilial risk factors for exocrine pancreatic cancer&quot;, section on 'Diabetes mellitus, glucose metabolism, and insulin resistance'</a>.)</p><p>Unexplained superficial thrombophlebitis, which may be migratory (classic Trousseau's syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], is sometimes present and reflects the hypercoagulable state that frequently accompanies pancreatic cancer. There is a particularly high incidence of thromboembolic events (both venous and arterial), particularly in the setting of advanced disease, and clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion. Multiple arterial emboli resulting from nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis may occasionally be the presenting sign of a pancreatic cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Thromboembolic complications occur more commonly in patients with tumors arising in the tail or body of the pancreas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

As an example, both cicatricial and bullous pemphigoid are described, even as a first sign of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cutaneous-manifestations-of-internal-malignancy#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cutaneous manifestations of internal malignancy&quot;, section on 'Paraneoplastic pemphigus'</a>.)</p><p>Rarely, erythematous subcutaneous areas of nodular fat necrosis, typically located on the legs (pancreatic panniculitis), may be evident, particularly in patients with the acinar cell variant of pancreatic cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F85874\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef85874 \">figure 2</a>). It is hypothesized that the condition is initiated by autodigestion of subcutaneous fat secondary to systemic spillage of excess digestive pancreatic enzymes. The presence of this condition is not pathognomonic for an exocrine pancreatic cancer, as it has been described with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, and in chronic pancreatitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of exocrine pancreatic neoplasms&quot;, section on 'Acinar cell carcinoma'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=panniculitis-recognition-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Panniculitis: Recognition and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cutaneous-manifestations-of-internal-malignancy#H28407824\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cutaneous manifestations of internal malignancy&quot;, section on 'Pancreatic panniculitis'</a>.)</p><p>Signs of metastatic disease may be present at presentation. Metastatic disease most commonly affects the liver, peritoneum, lungs, and less frequently, bone. Signs of advanced, incurable disease include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An abdominal mass.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ascites (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F89083\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89083 \">image 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left supraclavicular lymphadenopathy (Virchow's node) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F89084\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89084 \">image 2</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A palpable periumbilical mass (Sister Mary Joseph's node) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F89085\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89085 \">image 3</a>) or a palpable rectal shelf are present in some patients with widespread disease. Pancreatic cancer is the origin of a cutaneous metastasis to the umbilicus in 7 to 9 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p>Routine laboratory tests are often abnormal but are not specific for pancreatic cancer.

In one report, 24 of the 321 patients with a solid pancreatic mass who were identified over an eight-year period had it incidentally discovered (7 percent); one-half of these were adenocarcinomas, while the remainder were pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The majority of pancreatic lesions discovered on radiographic studies performed for another reason are cystic, and many of these represent intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, which represent a precursor lesion to exocrine pancreatic cancer.

Three of the more common findings leading to suspicion for pancreatic cancer are jaundice, epigastric pain, and weight loss.</p><p>The positive predictive value (PPV) of these symptoms for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is low, with the possible exception of jaundice in an older patient. This was shown in a case-control study that examined the risk of pancreatic cancer based upon symptoms that were identified in the year before diagnosis in 21,624 patients seen in a primary care clinic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

However, it is also more expensive than ultrasound or CT, and as an invasive procedure, it is associated with a finite rate of mortality (0.2 percent) and complications such as pancreatitis, bleeding, and cholangitis. As a result, the role of ERCP in patients with suspected pancreatic cancer is evolving into a mainly therapeutic modality for patients who present with cholestasis due to tumor obstruction of the biliary system and require placement of a biliary stent.

Once pancreatic cancer is suspected on initial imaging studies, the next step in the workup is generally a staging evaluation to establish disease extent and resectability rather than biopsy. Patients who are fit for major surgery and who appear to have potentially resectable pancreatic cancer after the staging evaluation is complete do not necessarily need a preoperative biopsy confirming the diagnosis of a pancreatic cancer before proceeding directly to surgery. However, the increased recognition of chronic or autoimmune pancreatitis, which can closely mimic pancreatic cancer, has altered this paradigm in certain populations. A preoperative biopsy may be recommended if a diagnosis of chronic or autoimmune pancreatitis is suspected on the basis of history (eg, extreme young age, prolonged ethanol abuse, history of other autoimmune diseases), particularly if imaging studies (EUS, ERCP, or MRCP) reveal multifocal biliary strictures (suggestive of autoimmune pancreatitis) or diffuse pancreatic ductal changes (suggestive of chronic pancreatitis).

The seventh edition of the AJCC staging criteria uses the T4 category (tumor involves the celiac axis or the SMA) to designate an unresectable primary tumor, with T3 designating a tumor that extends beyond the pancreas but without involvement of the celiac axis or mesenteric artery. However, as noted above, involvement of a focal area of the visceral arteries may be considered a borderline resectable situation. One study of 257 patients with stage III pancreatic cancer (all T4 lesions based upon infiltration of the celiac axis or SMA) found that 30 percent could undergo a successful complete (R0) resection after chemoradiation or chemotherapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. The eighth edition revision to the AJCC staging system no longer classifies T4 disease as categorically unresectable. However, they do not use the term &quot;borderline resectable&quot; to classify any clinical stage of disease.

However, the presence of extensive peripancreatic lymphatic involvement and nodal involvement beyond the peripancreatic tissues is generally considered to represent unresectable disease.

In the initial report of 25 patients, tumor contiguity with &gt;50 percent or more of the perimeter of the vessel was found to be the optimal threshold for predicting vascular invasion, with a sensitivity of 84 percent and a specificity of 98 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, these criteria were applied equally to venous and arterial structures. As noted above, because of advances in venous reconstruction, many institutions do not consider involvement of more than one-half of the circumference of the SMV or the SMV-portal vein confluence to represent unresectable disease. (See <a href=\"#H1472388\" class=\"local\">'Definitions of unresectable and borderline resectable disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Modifications of this grading system have been proposed, to increase the sensitivity for detecting venous invasion and specificity for detecting arterial invasion, but none is in widespread use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/107,109-111\" class=\"abstract_t\">107,109-111</a>]. High sensitivity for venous invasion is desirable so that patients with undiagnosed venous invasion will not be deemed unresectable intraoperatively if resection is attempted at an institution where venous reconstruction is not performed. On the other hand, high specificity for arterial invasion is desirable to minimize the risk of overstaging T3 disease, which may deny some patients a chance for potentially curative surgical resection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In general, helical CT has a high predictive value for unresectability (90 to 100 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/109,112-114\" class=\"abstract_t\">109,112-114</a>], but the predictive value for resectability is slightly lower (range 64 to 90 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/108,109,115\" class=\"abstract_t\">108,109,115</a>]. The accuracy of MDCT for assessing vascular invasion was addressed in a systematic review and meta-analysis of 18 studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>]. The pooled sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing vascular invasion were 77 and 81 percent, respectively, but when the analysis was limited to the five most recent studies conducted since 2004, and presumably using the most advanced CT technology, sensitivity and specificity rates were 85 and 82 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An important exception is that classic CT criteria for vascular involvement, particularly arterial involvement, are not reliable in patients who have undergone neoadjuvant therapy with a highly active chemotherapy combination such as FOLFIRINOX and are undergoing radiographic restaging to assess resectability. In such cases, surgical exploration may be the only method to assess true resectability.

Pancreatic cancer on EUS appears as a hypoechoic mass, typically with dilation of the proximal pancreatic duct. The border of the lesion may have an irregular contour, and the echo pattern of the mass may be homogenous or inhomogeneous. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-ultrasound-normal-pancreaticobiliary-anatomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic ultrasound: Normal pancreaticobiliary anatomy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-ultrasound-in-the-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic ultrasound in the staging of exocrine pancreatic cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Multiple studies comparing EUS with other imaging modalities for initial diagnosis and staging of pancreatic cancer concluded that EUS may be more accurate for smaller tumors, for local T and N staging, and for predicting vascular invasion. However, although EUS may detect metastatic disease in the liver or mediastinal lymph nodes, it is inferior to CT for evaluation of distant metastases. In addition, the specificity of EUS for excluding vascular invasion in small tumors is limited, particularly when inflammatory changes are present. EUS is also operator-dependent; as a result, its value varies with locally available expertise. Finally, the development of modern MDCT has markedly improved the sensitivity of CT for the detection of smaller tumors and the presence of vascular invasion, reaching values that are comparable to those obtained by EUS by an experienced endoscopist. However, head-to-head studies comparing the two modalities are lacking.

While it would seem intuitive that patients who have positive peritoneal washings would be unlikely to benefit from radical resection of the pancreatic primary tumor, it has not been conclusively demonstrated that positive peritoneal cytology as an isolated finding is an independent adverse prognostic factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/152-154\" class=\"abstract_t\">152-154</a>]. In general, most patients who have cytologically-positive washings have other findings that suggest advanced disease and unresectability such as ascites <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the presence of metastases in the liver, pelvis, or omentum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/152,155,156\" class=\"abstract_t\">152,155,156</a>]. If these are absent, most pancreatic surgeons do not rely upon the results of peritoneal washings obtained at the time of laparoscopy to guide decision-making regarding resectability. However, prognosis is worse in these cases, even in the absence of ascites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/157\" class=\"abstract_t\">157</a>], and the AJCC staging system considers positive peritoneal washings to represent distant metastatic (M1) disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111135\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111135 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2363341\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC ALGORITHM AND NEED FOR PREOPERATIVE BIOPSY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our suggested diagnostic approach to the patient with suspected pancreatic cancer is outlined in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F82523\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef82523 \">algorithm 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2362725\" class=\"local\">'Biopsy and establishing the diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p>A diagnostic biopsy of a suspected pancreatic malignancy may be indicated if there is evidence of systemic spread of disease, if there is local evidence of unresectability on staging studies, if the patient is unfit for major surgery, if neoadjuvant treatment is being contemplated (eg, for a borderline resectable lesion), or if alternative diagnoses need to be excluded (eg, metastatic disease to the pancreas). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-chemotherapy-and-radiation-for-nonmetastatic-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-borderline-resectable-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial chemotherapy and radiation for nonmetastatic, locally advanced, unresectable and borderline resectable, exocrine pancreatic cancer&quot;, section on 'Role of surgery'</a>.)</p><p>However, a preoperative diagnostic biopsy may not be needed in a fit patient with a potentially resectable pancreatic lesion that is highly suspected of malignancy. While a positive biopsy can confirm the suspected diagnosis, a benign sample will not exclude the presence of malignancy. In one systematic review of 53 studies addressing this issue, the negative predictive value of percutaneous and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided biopsies was only 60 to 70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/158\" class=\"abstract_t\">158</a>]. Attempts to make a preoperative tissue diagnosis may in fact be detrimental if tumor cells are disseminated during percutaneous biopsy.</p><p>Thus, if a patient is a reasonable surgical candidate, and if the clinical presentation and imaging are typical for a resectable adenocarcinoma after the staging evaluation has been completed, it is reasonable to proceed to surgery without a tissue diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H18017084\" class=\"local\">'Staging system and the staging workup'</a> above.)</p><p>However, it must be recognized by both the clinician and the patient that uncertainty regarding the diagnosis in these instances persists and that some patients with benign lesions may be subjected to the radical resections used for malignant lesions. These cases comprise between 5 and 11 percent of patients who undergo surgery for a presumed cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/159-163\" class=\"abstract_t\">159-163</a>]. The frequency of radical resection for benign disease may be reduced when this approach is combined with additional imaging, including EUS-guided transduodenal biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H2363690\" class=\"local\">'EUS-guided biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p>Focal chronic pancreatitis and autoimmune pancreatitis are the two benign processes that are most commonly mistaken for pancreatic malignancy on computed tomography (CT) or US. EUS-guided biopsy may be recommended if a diagnosis of chronic or autoimmune pancreatitis is suspected on the basis of history (eg, extreme young age, prolonged ethanol abuse, history of other autoimmune diseases), particularly if further imaging studies (either EUS, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [ERCP] or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography [MRCP]) reveal multifocal biliary strictures (suggestive of autoimmune pancreatitis) or diffuse pancreatic ductal changes (suggestive of chronic pancreatitis). In addition, serologic testing can aid in the diagnosis of autoimmune pancreatitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autoimmune-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autoimmune pancreatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For jaundiced patients who have no involvement or minimal involvement of the major vessels according to CT or EUS and no evidence of distant metastases on helical CT or EUS, we proceed directly to an attempt at surgical resection. For non-jaundiced patients (particularly with body or tail tumors), or those with major but incomplete involvement of the vascular structures (tumor contiguous to less than one-half of the vessel circumference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/108,109\" class=\"abstract_t\">108,109</a>]), we perform preoperative laparoscopy to exclude tiny metastases that might have been overlooked by CT.

More than 95 percent of malignant neoplasms of the pancreas arise from the exocrine elements and are referred to as exocrine pancreatic cancers. (See <a href=\"#H158746930\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common presenting symptoms in patients with exocrine pancreatic cancer are pain, jaundice, and weight loss. Compared with tumors in the body and tail of the gland, pancreatic head tumors more often present with jaundice, steatorrhea, and weight loss. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who present with jaundice or epigastric pain and weight loss often undergo right upper quadrant transabdominal ultrasound (US) initially to evaluate for dilated bile ducts or a pancreatic mass. (See <a href=\"#H158747298\" class=\"local\">'Initial testing'</a> above and <a href=\"#H163254646\" class=\"local\">'Transabdominal ultrasound'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In the jaundiced patient, US is highly sensitive for detecting biliary tract dilation and establishing the level of obstruction; it is highly sensitive for pancreatic masses &gt;3 cm. (See <a href=\"#H158747091\" class=\"local\">'Jaundice'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is a highly sensitive tool for visualization of the biliary tree and pancreatic ducts in patients with jaundice. However, the role of ERCP in patients with suspected pancreatic cancer is evolving into a mainly therapeutic rather than diagnostic modality in patients who present with cholestasis due to tumor obstruction of the biliary system. (See <a href=\"#H21056075\" class=\"local\">'ERCP'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">An alternative approach is magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). MRCP is generally reserved for patients with gastric outlet or duodenal stenosis, or who have had surgical rearrangement (eg, Billroth II) or ductal disruption, resulting in ducts that are difficult to assess successfully by ERCP, in the setting of chronic pancreatitis, or for patients in whom attempted ERCP is either totally unsuccessful or provides incomplete information because of pancreatic duct obstruction. (See <a href=\"#H1617931\" class=\"local\">'MRCP'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with epigastric pain and weight loss without jaundice, in whom the differential diagnosis includes pancreatitis, transabdominal US is not the preferred initial test because it is associated with a high frequency of incomplete examinations owing to overlying bowel gas due to ileus, and it cannot clearly identify necrosis within the pancreas; these important findings are best seen by contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan. (See <a href=\"#H163255347\" class=\"local\">'Epigastric pain and weight loss'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) may be of use in a patient who is suspected of having pancreatic cancer based upon the clinical presentation of jaundice, unexplained upper abdominal <span class=\"nowrap\">pain/weight</span> loss, or an unexplained episode of pancreatitis, but who has no evidence of a mass lesion on initial transabdominal US or CT. (See <a href=\"#H158747860\" class=\"local\">'Subsequent testing if initial imaging is negative'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Given the limited sensitivity and specificity, the serum tumor marker carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) should not be used as a diagnostic test for pancreatic cancer. (See <a href=\"#H1620046\" class=\"local\">'CA 19-9'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Histologic confirmation is required to establish a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Biopsy of a pancreatic mass can be accomplished through percutaneous or endoscopic approaches. However, not all patients require a preoperative biopsy, and the next step in the workup of a patient with suspected pancreatic cancer is often a staging evaluation to establish disease extent and resectability rather than biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H2362725\" class=\"local\">'Biopsy and establishing the diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When a mass lesion of the pancreas is detected on CT or US, it is reasonable to conclude that a neoplasm (most likely malignant) is present, and triple-phase, contrast enhanced helical (preferably multidetector row) CT is an appropriate next step to assess disease extent and resectability. Local unresectability is usually (but not always) due to vascular invasion. (See <a href=\"#H18176032\" class=\"local\">'Abdominal CT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">EUS is another effective method to assess tumor extent and vascular invasion, but we generally prefer CT given its greater utility in assessing for distant metastases. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'EUS'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, pancreatic cancers can be categorized on a continuum from resectable to unresectable according to the involvement of adjacent structures and the presence of distant metastases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F97572\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97572 \">figure 5</a>). Although practice is variable, most surgeons would consider a pancreatic cancer to be categorically unresectable if any of the following are present (see <a href=\"#H1472388\" class=\"local\">'Definitions of unresectable and borderline resectable disease'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Extensive peripancreatic lymphatic involvement, nodal involvement beyond the peripancreatic tissues, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> distant metastases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Direct involvement of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), inferior vena cava, aorta, celiac axis, or hepatic artery, as defined by the absence of a fat plane between the low density tumor and these structures on CT scan (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F97571\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97571 \">figure 6</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Encasement (more than one-half of the vessel circumference) or <span class=\"nowrap\">occlusion/thrombus</span> of the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) or the SMV-portal vein confluence used to be universally considered an indicator of unresectability. However, many centers have demonstrated the feasibility of SMV reconstruction, and this is now considered by most experienced centers to represent borderline resectable disease; in practice, most of these patients are referred for neoadjuvant therapy prior to surgery. (See <a href=\"#H1472388\" class=\"local\">'Definitions of unresectable and borderline resectable disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The utility of positron emission tomography (PET) scans, chest CT, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the staging workup of suspected pancreatic cancer, particularly whether any of these imaging studies provides information beyond that obtained by triple-phase, contrast enhanced helical multidetector row CT remains uncertain, and we do not routinely order these tests. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'PET scanning'</a> above and <a href=\"#H937783\" class=\"local\">'Chest CT'</a> above and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'MRI'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Assessment of serum levels of the tumor marker CA 19-9 prior to surgery and following resection, if elevated, is valuable to assist in prognostication. In addition, serial monitoring of CA 19-9 levels, if initially elevated, is useful to follow patients after potentially curative surgery and for those who are receiving chemotherapy for advanced disease. (See <a href=\"#H1620046\" class=\"local\">'CA 19-9'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our general diagnostic approach, as detailed in the following sections, is summarized in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F82523\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef82523 \">algorithm 2</a>). In general (see <a href=\"#H2363341\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic algorithm and need for preoperative biopsy'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tissue diagnosis is mandatory for patients who are unfit to undergo a major resection, for those with a high suspicion of metastatic disease, and for any patient being considered for neoadjuvant therapy because of locally advanced nonmetastatic disease. EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) is the best modality for obtaining a tissue diagnosis, even if the tumor is poorly visualized by other imaging modalities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If a patient is a reasonable surgical candidate, and if the clinical presentation and imaging are typical for a resectable adenocarcinoma, it is reasonable to proceed to surgery without a tissue diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">For jaundiced patients with no involvement or minimal involvement of the major vessels and no evidence of distant metastases on radiographic imaging, we proceed directly to open laparotomy.
