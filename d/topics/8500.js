The most frequent use of clopidogrel is to prevent potentially fatal thrombosis of newly implanted coronary stents. Accordingly, hypersensitivity reactions to clopidogrel have particular importance in this setting, since the timing typically coincides with the period of heightened vulnerability for stent thrombosis. The most common hypersensitivity reactions to clopidogrel are dermatologic eruptions, although severe systemic reactions can also occur.</p><p>The incidence and clinical manifestations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> reactions are discussed here.

The signs and symptoms are most suggestive of a T cell-mediated mechanism, but other types of reactions (such as urticaria and angioedema) indicate that several mechanisms are possible.</p><p>Allergy evaluations have been performed in a small number of studies to begin to assess the pathogenesis of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-clopidogrel/abstract/2,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,25</a>]. In the largest study involving allergy testing, 62 patients underwent extensive allergy testing <strong>after</strong> they had been empirically treated through their clopidogrel reactions, completed therapy, and were free of the drug for at least four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-clopidogrel/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The testing was performed for the purpose of better defining the pathophysiology of clopidogrel reactions, but some important controls were lacking. Evaluation consisted of <span class=\"nowrap\">prick/puncture</span> and intradermal testing (with a clopidogrel solution of 0.75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL)</span> for immediate-type reactions, as well as delayed (24 hours) reading of intradermal tests. Delayed reading of intradermal tests is sometimes used to evaluate delayed-onset cutaneous reactions, although this testing method has not been validated. Patch testing (clopidogrel 20 percent in petrolatum alba and 30 percent in water) was undertaken for delayed reactions, with readings at 72 hours and up to seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-clopidogrel/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Skin biopsy was obtained in some patients. Testing results were available for 42 patients. None had positive skin prick tests. Three had positive-immediate (ie, &lt;30 minutes) intradermal tests, all of whom had presented with urticaria or angioedema. Patch testing was positive in 81 percent. However, all patients were managed in the same way. Of note, this study did not evaluate nonreacting patients or nonexposed individuals as controls to determine the optimal concentration for skin testing or the incidence of sensitization without clinical disease, which are significant limitations. This study is discussed more below.

An appropriate skin examination should be performed based on the extent of the symptoms and the nature of the complaints. The most common presentation is an erythematous, macular, morbilliform rash, beginning on the face, chest, or abdomen, and appearing 5 to 10 days after the drug is initiated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F83637\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83637 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-clopidogrel/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Drug desensitization is best studied in immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated drug reactions, but it has been applied to other types of reactions as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-clopidogrel/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1531995\"><span class=\"h3\">Advantages</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary advantage of desensitization, compared with treating through, is that glucocorticoid therapy is not required.

Patients were excluded if their <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> reaction was anaphylaxis, angioedema involving the upper or lower airway, irritation or blistering of mucous membranes, or blistering skin rash.

In the largest series of 24 patients, the protocol used required eight to nine hours and was performed in the outpatient setting, except when the patient was currently hospitalized for other reasons (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F83638\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83638 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-clopidogrel/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. An oral solution of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> was prepared by finely crushing the drug into a liquid vehicle. Other smaller series have described longer and shorter protocols [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-clopidogrel/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. No head-to-head comparisons of different protocols have been performed. With such small numbers, it is difficult to make strong recommendations concerning the safety of outpatient desensitization without there being availability of intensive treatment for anaphylaxis, although well-characterized reports of anaphylaxis are not readily identified. In many instances outside of specialized research centers, such care can only be found in a hospital setting, such as an ICU or emergency department.</p><p>Glucocorticoids are not required during desensitization, and no other premedications were given in the 24-patient series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-clopidogrel/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Antihistamines and antileukotriene drugs were discontinued for seven days before the procedure. Beta-blockers are usually withheld for one to two days prior to desensitization, because beta-blockade can interfere with the ability of the patient to respond to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>, were it to be required during the desensitization.</p><p>In the 24-patient series, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> was discontinued for five days before desensitization to allow the drug to wash out of the patient's body, during which time the rash usually resolved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-clopidogrel/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This wash-out period was felt to be important, since patients who did not complete the wash-out period were more likely to react during the desensitization, although it is also possible that this reflected more severe hypersensitivity in those patients whose symptoms persisted.</p><p>During the wash-out period, alternative antiplatelet agents are given to patients with recently placed intracoronary stents to prevent stent thrombosis. The safest alternative antiplatelet agent during this process is unclear. In the 24-patient series, subjects were given <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ticlopidine-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ticlopidine</a> 250 mg twice daily for five days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-clopidogrel/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Only 4 patients had reactions (all cutaneous) during desensitization. All patients were able to continue therapy for six months, although 1 had mild intermittent symptoms that were managed with antihistamines, and 2 were noncompliant and required repeat desensitization.
