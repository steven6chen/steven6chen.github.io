Two types of OA are distinguished based on their appearance after a latency period: (1) OA caused by workplace sensitizers: allergic or immunological (with a latency period); (2) OA caused by irritants: nonallergic or nonimmunologic, irritant-induced asthma including reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS). </p><p>Occupational asthma accounts for approximately 10 to 25 percent of adult onset asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-definitions-epidemiology-causes-and-risk-factors/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. In the case of allergic OA, a high degree of clinical suspicion is needed as the latency period for sensitization varies from a few months to several years, depending on several factors, including the intensity of exposure, the specific sensitizing agent, and individual susceptibility.</p><p>The definition, epidemiology, causes, and risk factors of OA are reviewed here. The pathophysiology, clinical assessment, diagnosis, and management of OA and reactive airways dysfunction are discussed separately.

A number of factors appear to influence the incidence and prevalence of OA, including sex, geographic location, underlying prevalence of atopy, smoking, and most significantly, the type and intensity of workplace exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-definitions-epidemiology-causes-and-risk-factors/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Several studies have reported on the proportion of asthma attributable to occupational exposure. Most estimates are in the range of 5 to 10 percent of adult onset asthma, although a wide range of rates have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-definitions-epidemiology-causes-and-risk-factors/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. Based on data from the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and the Adult Asthma Call-Back Survey, the proportion of ever-employed adults with work-related asthma in the United States approaches 16 percent with a variation of 9 to 23 percent among individual states [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-definitions-epidemiology-causes-and-risk-factors/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS) found a work-attributable risk of asthma of 10 to 25 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-definitions-epidemiology-causes-and-risk-factors/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. The variability of prevalence rates probably reflects differences in methodology, case definitions, and immunogenicity of specific workplace agents. Furthermore, the fact that asthma is a common disease that often presents de novo or worsens during adulthood due to non-occupational factors, further complicates epidemiologic assessment of OA. Based on the European Community Respiratory Health Survey results, it was estimated that occupational exposures contribute to one in seven cases of severe exacerbation of asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-definitions-epidemiology-causes-and-risk-factors/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The effect of sex on the reported incidence of OA was examined in a 12 year study in Finland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-definitions-epidemiology-causes-and-risk-factors/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The risk of OA among men was highest among bakers, laundry workers, shoemakers and shoe repairers, tanners, fellmongers and pelt dressers (removing fur from hides for leather work), and also metal plating and coating workers. For the women, the risk was highest among shoemakers and repairers, railway and station personnel, jewelry engravers, engine room crew, molders, round-timber workers, and bakers.</p><p>The geographic location influences the distribution of asthma and bronchial responsiveness in the population and, thus, the prevalence of OA. As an example, there is a low prevalence of OA, atopy, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness in Mediterranean and Eastern European countries, compared with English-speaking countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-definitions-epidemiology-causes-and-risk-factors/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>Several cross-sectional studies of populations at high risk of developing OA demonstrate that approximately 2 to 8 percent per person-year of those exposed to high-molecular-weight (proteinaceous) agents, such as laboratory animals, latex, and flour, and 5 to 10 percent of subjects exposed to low-molecular-weight (chemical) agents develop OA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F66185\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66185 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-definitions-epidemiology-causes-and-risk-factors/abstract/11,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,17,18</a>].</p><p>The proportion of individuals with asthma who have worsening asthma symptoms at work (work-exacerbated asthma) is approximately 10 percent.

The likelihood of developing the disease is influenced by a variety of host factors, including atopy, cigarette smoking, and genetic predisposition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Atopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atopy is consistently associated with sensitization to high-molecular-weight (HMW) agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-definitions-epidemiology-causes-and-risk-factors/abstract/11,22,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,22,47</a>]. Thus, atopic individuals who wish to enter high-risk workplaces should be advised of the potential for developing OA or exacerbating preexisting asthma and should receive regular medical follow-up. Despite this increased risk, atopy should not be used as a screening tool in high-risk workplaces because the positive predictive value of atopy for the subsequent development of symptoms is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-definitions-epidemiology-causes-and-risk-factors/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. Among supermarket bakery workers, specific sensitization to work-related proteins was two to four times as likely among atopic compared with nonatopic workers, but overall, less than 30 percent of atopic bakery workers developed OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-definitions-epidemiology-causes-and-risk-factors/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Cigarette smoking</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cigarette smoking is a risk factor for sensitization to some HMW occupational allergens, including coffee, castor beans, shrimp, and snow-crab, but not to laboratory animal allergens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-definitions-epidemiology-causes-and-risk-factors/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Cigarette smoking is also a risk factor for sensitization to a few low-molecular-weight (LMW) agents, such as platinum salts and phthalic anhydride, but appears to be less important in promoting sensitization to other LMW agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-definitions-epidemiology-causes-and-risk-factors/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>As an example, among platinum refinery workers, smoking is the most important risk factor for sensitization. In an observational cohort study of 91 workers followed for approximately seven years, there was an increased risk of developing skin test reactivity to workplace antigens in smokers when compared to nonsmoking controls (relative risk 5, 95% CI 1.7-15.2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-definitions-epidemiology-causes-and-risk-factors/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Similarly, synergistic interaction between smoking and atopy has been noted in workers exposed to tetrachlorophthalic anhydride or laboratory animals, with atopic smokers demonstrating the highest prevalence of sensitization to these antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-definitions-epidemiology-causes-and-risk-factors/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>].</p><p>However, being sensitized does not mean that the worker will develop clinical symptoms or occupational asthma. The role of smoking as a risk factor for the development of occupational asthma to high molecular weight agents is controversial, particularly with flour, laboratory animals, latex, and enzymes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-definitions-epidemiology-causes-and-risk-factors/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. In workers processing snow-crab and salmon, smoking is thought to increase the risk of occupational asthma.

Genes that have been implicated include human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II molecules and polymorphisms in non-HLA genes (eg, glutathione S-transferases, N-acetyltransferase, tumor necrosis factor alpha, prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase).

OA due to an immunologic stimulus has a latency period between exposure and symptom onset, while OA due to a nonimmunologic stimulus does not. When a nonimmunologic stimulus triggers OA, it is referred to as reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS) or irritant-induced asthma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reactive airways dysfunction syndrome and irritant-induced asthma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stimuli that cause immunologic OA are divided into two categories, high-molecular-weight (eg, flour, laboratory animal proteins) and low-molecular-weight (eg, diisocyanates, trimellitic anhydride, formaldehyde). (See <a href=\"#H1191269\" class=\"local\">'Causative agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low-molecular-weight chemicals are incomplete antigens (ie, haptens) that combine with a protein to produce a sensitizing neoantigen. High-molecular-weight organic agents are complete sensitizing antigens.

It is estimated that 5 to 25 percent of all adult-onset asthma cases are occupationally related.
