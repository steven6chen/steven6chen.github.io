The etiologic agent was identified as <em>Ehrlichia chaffeensis</em>, the agent of human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME). In 1994, <em>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</em> was identified as the agent of human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. HGA was previously called human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE). Both of these tick-borne illnesses are recognized as separate disease entities, even though their clinical and laboratory manifestations are similar.</p><p>The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of human ehrlichiosis will be reviewed here. The microbiology of ehrlichial organisms and the mechanisms by which they cause disease are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-of-ehrlichiae\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology of ehrlichiae&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ehrlichiae are obligate intracellular bacteria that grow within membrane bound vacuoles in human and animal leukocytes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61249%7EID%2F50113\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61249 graphicRef50113 \">picture 1A-B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F71396\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71396 \">picture 2</a>). The taxonomy, phylogeny, and host specificity of these bacteria are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-of-ehrlichiae\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology of ehrlichiae&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The two most important species to infect humans include <em>E. chaffeensis</em>, the causative agent of human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME), and <em>A. phagocytophilum</em>, the agent of human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA). Less commonly, ehrlichiosis is caused by <em>Ehrlichia&nbsp;ewingii</em>, which was discovered in 1999 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In 2011, a third species of <em>Ehrlichia</em> was identified in four patients from Wisconsin and Minnesota who had fever, malaise, headache, and lymphopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Molecular methods, culture techniques, and serologic testing have demonstrated that this new species is closely related to <em>Ehrlichia muris</em>, which is found in Eastern Europe and Asia. These epidemiologic findings are important since ehrlichiosis has not been previously described in Wisconsin or Minnesota.</p><p>Another species less commonly seen is <em>Neorickettsia sennetsu</em>, which causes a mild mononucleosis-like illness. Neorickettsial illness has not been reported outside the Far East and Southeast Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The epidemiologic features of human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME) and human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA) are similar (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F64475\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64475 \">table 1</a>). The incidence of HME appears to be rising over time, with 4613 cases reported from 2008 to 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In addition, those cases attributed to <em>A. phagocytophilum</em>, the causative agent of HGA, increased from 348 cases in 2000 to 1761 in 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Most cases occur in the spring and summer months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Human monocytic ehrlichiosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HME is endemic in the southeastern, south central, and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A few cases of HME have been recognized in New England and the Pacific Northwest, and isolated cases have been reported in Europe, Africa, and Mexico [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Serological studies have suggested that <em>E. chaffeensis</em> also occurs in Mexico, Venezuela, Brazil, and Chile. Serological and molecular testing of vertebrates and humans have detected <em>E. chaffeensis</em> or a closely related ehrlichial agent in Venezuela [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], China, Korea, Croatia, Poland, Greece, Italy, and several countries in central Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>The average reported annual incidence of HME in the United States was 3.2 cases per million population in 2012, with wide variations in incidence by state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The total number of cases of HME reported annually to the CDC quadrupled from 2000 to 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, these numbers likely underestimate the actual incidence of the disease as many cases are not confirmed by laboratory testing and current surveillance systems rely on voluntary reporting by clinicians. Depending on geographical location and exposure history, incidence rates as high as 660 per 100,000 have been reported in outbreak situations, while serologic surveys also show evidence of asymptomatic infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Tick bites, exposure to wildlife, and golfing have been associated with an increased risk of infection. In some locations, HME may be more common than Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Rocky Mountain spotted fever&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Human granulocytic anaplasmosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The HGA agent, <em>Ehrlichia phagocytophila</em>, and <em>Ehrlichia equi</em> are now recognized as the same organism that has been renamed <em>A. phagocytophilum</em>.</p><p>HGA is more frequently reported than HME in the United States, with an average reported annual incidence of 6.3 cases per million population during 2008 to 2012 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F72124\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72124 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], and appears to be on the rise. The number of cases of HGA reported to the CDC increased more than threefold from 2000 to 2008 (from 351 to 1053 cases) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. These estimates are likely to be inaccurate, because reporting is a passive process and because a significant number of cases diagnosed on clinical grounds are not confirmed serologically. In addition, serologic studies of persons with a history of tick bites suggest that many infections are asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Regional estimates of HGA vary significantly by locale; states with the highest incidence are Rhode Island (36.5 cases per million), Minnesota (3.9 to 12.3 cases per million), Connecticut (8.1 to 15.9 cases per million), Wisconsin (8.8 to 9.5 cases per million), New York (2.3 to 2.7 cases per million), and Maryland (1.6 cases per million).</p><p>Infection with HGA is also recognized in Europe with similar risk factors of tick bite exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. The majority of human cases in Europe have been reported from Central Europe (eg, Slovenia) and Scandinavia (eg, Sweden) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Although numerous studies done in various European countries have shown that <em>A. phagocytophilum</em> is commonly present in rodents, small mammals, and ticks, relatively few human cases of HGA have been recognized and the course of disease when infection does occur appears to be less severe than that seen in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. It is currently unknown if these findings are due to the presence of less pathogenic or nonpathogenic variants of <em>A. phagocytophilum</em> in Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">E. ewingii infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 1999, <em>E. ewingii</em>, the agent of canine granulocytic ehrlichiosis, was also found to cause disease in humans. Several of these cases occurred in Missouri, an area endemic for <em>E. chaffeensis</em>, and the clinical features of illness in these patients were initially confused with those of HME [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Subsequently, however, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) distinguished the organism in these cases from <em>E. chaffeensis</em>; morulae were observed in granulocytes in two of the patients, and one patient's dogs displayed a serologic reaction similar to the patient.</p><p>Human ewingii infection is likely to be widely distributed throughout the south central and southeastern United States as the vector for this disease (the Lone Star tick) is found throughout this wide geographic area. Most human <em>E. ewingii</em> infections have been recognized in immunocompromised patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. It is likely that some cases of <em>E. ewingii</em> infection are misdiagnosed as HME since the most commonly used serological tests for convalescent antibodies to <em>Ehrlichia </em>do not distinguish between <em>E. ewingii</em> and <em>E. chaffeensis</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">TICK VECTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principal vector of <em>E. chaffeensis</em> (agent of HME) is the Lone Star tick (<em>Amblyomma americanum</em>) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F71086\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71086 \">picture 3</a>). Other ticks such as <em>Amblyomma maculatum</em>, <em>Dermacentor variabilis</em> and <em>Ixodes pacificus</em> have occasionally been found to contain <em>E. chaffeensis</em> DNA, but their role in transmission is either minor or unlikely. Surveys of <em>A. americanum</em> ticks have shown rates of infection ranging from 0 to 27 percent; these wide ranges have been noted not only from different geographic locations, but also from the same location sampled at different times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The tick vectors of <em>E. chaffeensis</em>, found in South America, Asia, and Africa, have not been firmly identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Epidemiologic studies suggest that the tick vector for a novel ehrlichial species, identified in Wisconsin and Minnesota in 2011, is <em>Ixodes scapularis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p><em>A. phagocytophilum</em> (agent of HGA) may be transmitted by <em>I. scapularis</em> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73802\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73802 \">picture 4</a>), the tick that is also the vector of Lyme disease and babesiosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In studies of <em>I. scapularis</em> ticks from different locales, 2.2 to 26 percent of ticks were coinfected with <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em> (agent of Lyme disease) and <em>A. phagocytophilum</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. In fact, coinfection with HGA and Lyme disease occurs in approximately 3 to 15 percent of patients living in Connecticut and Wisconsin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. <em>I. pacificus</em> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F60501\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60501 \">picture 5</a>), the western black-legged tick, is the primary vector of HGA in the western United States and <em>Ixodes ricinus</em> is the presumed vector in Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The distribution of vector tick species is partially overlapping in the United States (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F56962\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56962 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">ANIMAL RESERVOIRS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>White tail deer are the principal animal reservoir for HME, and deer and the white-footed mouse are the principal animal hosts for HGA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Although <em>E. chaffeensis</em> infection has been noted in coyotes and goats, their role in the epidemiology of HME remains to be determined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/11,28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,28-30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Other modes of transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although ehrlichiosis is primarily a tick-borne disease, transmission by other means has been suggested, such as maternal-child transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], blood transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], and through direct contact with slaughtered deer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Nosocomial transmission of <em>A. phagocytophilum</em> was strongly suggested by a cluster of nine cases in China [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Five family members and four health care providers became ill within 9 to 17 days after exposure to an index patient whose fatal illness was characterized by fever, hemorrhage, and multi-system failure. Contact investigation found that all nine secondary cases had exposure to blood; none had a history of a tick bite.</p><p>This case series strongly suggests the possibility of human-to-human transmission of <em>A. phagocytophilum</em> and this is the first report of this disease in China. Limitations of this report include lack of any diagnostic testing for <em>Anaplasma</em> in the index case [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]; secondary cases had <em>A. phagocytophilum</em> DNA in their bloodstream by PCR testing and subsequent seroconversion; diagnostic technology for confirmatory cultures was not available.</p><p>Ehrlichiosis and <em>Anaplasma</em> transmission have been reported to occur through transfusion of blood, leukoreduced red cells, and platelets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. <em>E chaffeensis</em> has also been transmitted through kidney transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Adults</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most published data relate to infection in adults. Both HME and HGA typically present as an acute illness; however, there is a wide spectrum of disease, from subclinical and self-limited to subacute or chronic infection. Older patients and those with comorbid illnesses or immunosuppressive conditions such as HIV appear to have more severe infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Most ehrlichial diseases have an incubation period of one to two weeks, but a shorter period may be seen. In a study of 18 adults with HGA, for example, symptoms appeared an average of 5.5 days after a tick bite was noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Both HGA and HME produce variable symptoms, the severity of which can range from mild to severe.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients are febrile, but clinically mild or inapparent infection probably occurs. As an example, in studies of transfusion related disease, the donors implicated as the source of transmission were asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgia, headache, and chills occur in over two-thirds of cases, while nausea, vomiting, arthralgias, and cough occur in 25 to 50 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rash, which can be macular, maculopapular, or petechial, occurs in a minority of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In one review of 211 cases of HME, for example, rash was noted in 36 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In contrast, rash is a rare finding in HGA infection, occurring in only 1 of 41 patients in one report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Some experts caution that when rash is present in a patient with HGA, the possibility of coinfection with <em>B. burgdorferi</em> or infection with another agent such as <em>Rickettsia rickettsii</em> or the meningococcus should be suspected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurologic symptoms, including mental status changes, stiff neck, and clonus, are less common. In a retrospective review, CSF samples were obtained for neurologic signs or symptoms in 15 of 57 patients (26 percent) with a confirmed diagnosis of <em>Ehrlichia</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Eight of the samples were abnormal; the most common abnormalities were lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein levels. In a case report of ehrlichial meningitis, characteristic inclusions within mononuclear cells were seen in the CSF, compatible with <em>Ehrlichia morulae</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients present subacutely with unexplained fever, and fever can persist for up to two months in the absence of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/41,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,46</a>].

Data are limited on the effect of pregnancy, which can be associated with an increase in severity of some infections. In a case series of six pregnant women with HGA, all had mild disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

The most common, occurring in 50 to 90 percent of patients, are leukopenia (often accompanied by a left shift), thrombocytopenia, and elevated plasma levels of aminotransferases (transaminases), lactate dehydrogenase, and alkaline phosphatase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/43,49,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,49,54</a>]. Anemia and an elevated plasma creatinine concentration also may be seen.</p><p>Leukopenia in patients with HGA can be caused by lymphopenia or neutropenia.

In contrast, the initial neutrophil count in patients with HGA is inversely related to the duration of symptoms before treatment is begun. In one study, for example, neutropenia was seen in three of four patients who had HGA for more than four days versus only one in nine patients with a shorter duration of illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Thrombocytopenia was observed more often than leukopenia in a retrospective study of 144 patients with HGA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. This study also included matched controls with other acute febrile illnesses, and the risk of having ehrlichiosis in this group of patients varied inversely with granulocyte and platelet counts. The number of band neutrophils was also increased in most patients with HGA from the time of onset through the eighth day of illness. The authors emphasized that automated differential counting of leukocytes does not separate band neutrophils from segmented neutrophils or detect morulae, and they stressed the important point that a manual differential count should be ordered if ehrlichiosis is suspected.</p><p>Changes in the cerebrospinal fluid are common in patients in whom a lumbar puncture is performed because of neurologic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In one report, for example, lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated CSF protein levels were found in 21 of 38 patients with <em>E. chaffeensis</em> infection.

Ehrlichiosis has been called &quot;spotless&quot; RMSF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>], but this appellation is misleading, as infection due to <em>R. rickettsii</em> can be &quot;spotless&quot; as well. Nevertheless, the combination of no rash and leukopenia makes ehrlichial infection more likely. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Rocky Mountain spotted fever&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Ehrlichiosis may also be confused with viral illnesses (such as mononucleosis, Colorado tick fever, West Nile virus infection), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, hematologic malignancy, cholangitis, the early phases of hepatitis A infection, and community acquired pneumonia.

In such cases, the typical rash of early Lyme disease (erythema migrans) may mislead the clinician into ignoring possible coinfection with ehrlichiae. Findings that may suggest coinfection include leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and high fever (all relatively uncommon in Lyme disease) and abnormal liver enzyme tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The differential diagnosis is considerably broader in patients with subacute or chronic infection due to <em>E. chaffeensis</em>.

The isolation of <em>A. phagocytophilum</em> from three additional patients has been accomplished using a cell culture system derived from human promyelocytic leukemia cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-of-ehrlichiae\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology of ehrlichiae&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the absence of culture, other techniques have been used to establish the diagnosis of ehrlichiosis, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunologic and immunohistologic methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/4,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,54</a>]. At present, there are five primary methods available for the diagnosis of HME and HGA; the preferred and most widely available of these methods is the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serology using the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test and reagents specific for HME and HGA or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA).

As an example, the presence of a normal white blood cell and platelet count and the failure to detect morulae in white cells should <strong>not</strong> dissuade clinicians from considering HGA or HME as a possible diagnosis in patients with a nonspecific febrile illness who become ill in the spring or summer months and have a history of recent tick bite or tick exposure.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Serology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HME and HGA are separate diseases caused by different etiologic agents. As a result, serologic tests that detect <em>E. chaffeensis</em>, the cause of HME, will not detect the human granulocytic anaplasmosis and vice versa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Because serologic cross reactivity can occasionally occur between <em>E. chaffeensis</em> and <em>A. phagocytophilum</em>, it is not possible to reliably differentiate between these two infections with a single serologic assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/13,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,63</a>]. Most patients with <em>E. ewingii</em> infection develop antibodies that cross-react with <em>E. chaffeensis</em> antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no standardized antigens or consensus opinion as to what thresholds constitute a significant antibody titer.

Serologic tests for ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis are available through most state public health and multiple commercial laboratories.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HME and HGA can be confirmed serologically using the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test. IFA tests can be obtained through state health departments. The current case definition of HME used by the CDC requires at least a fourfold rise or fall in immunofluorescent antibody titer against <em>E. chaffeensis</em> between the acute and convalescent stage with a minimum titer considered to be indicative of current or previous infection. In most laboratories, the minimum titer ranges from 1:64 to 1:80 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. An important limitation of this test is that antibodies first become detectable two to three weeks after the onset of the illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].<br/><br/>The IFA test has been estimated to be 94 to 100 percent sensitive if the second paired sample is obtained 14 days following the onset of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].

Although specific IgM antibody tests for ehrlichiosis may become positive during the first six to seven weeks after onset, there are no data that suggest that such tests are more sensitive than standard IgG-based tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Buffy coat examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intracytoplasmic inclusions (morulae) are characteristic of ehrlichiosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].

Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> is not recommended for use in pregnancy, some experts believe that, in cases when the infection is considered life-threatening, doxycycline might be warranted in the treatment of HME or HGA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Doxycycline has been used successfully and safely in a few cases in pregnant women with HME or HGA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/52,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,84</a>].</p><p>An alternative to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a>, which is both active and bactericidal against HGA in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. Rifampin has been effective in small numbers of pregnant women with HGA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/52,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,86</a>].</p><p>Perinatal transmission of HGA has only been described in case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/31,52,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,52,87</a>]. Performing PCR on blood from the neonate should be considered in cases of HGA that were diagnosed in the mother during pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Reinfection and immunity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Even without treatment most patients with ehrlichiosis probably make a full recovery, and currently there is no evidence that untreated ehrlichiosis produces chronic symptoms such as those seen after Lyme disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, infection may not confer long lasting immunity. A single patient has been reported who experienced two episodes of HGA spaced two years apart. At the onset of his second infection, his antibody titer to <em>A. phagocytophilum</em> had fallen from 1:1280 to 1:80 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h1\">MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Human ehrlichiosis is a serious disease with significant morbidity, particularly if appropriate antibiotics are delayed. In a 10-year retrospective review of 46 highly selected patients with confirmed <em>Ehrlichia</em> or <em>Anaplasma</em> infections seen at a tertiary care center, delay in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> therapy was associated with increased rates of mechanical ventilation and longer hospital stays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].</p><p>The limited available information on mortality is based upon small case series, which may overestimate mortality rates. Estimated mortality rates have been 2 to 5 percent for HME and as high as 7 to 10 percent for HGA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. As an example, a retrospective case study of 41 patients with laboratory-diagnosed HGA infection found a case fatality rate of 4.9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Secondary opportunistic infections, such as fungal pneumonia, were common in patients who died [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. However, another report suggested that the fatality rate of HGA might actually be less than 1 percent given the frequency of asymptomatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Ehrlichiosis may be a life-threatening infection in patients coinfected with HIV. In a review of 21 coinfected patients, 6 of 13 patients died, and several other patients had severe illnesses that included respiratory failure, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and fungal superinfections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Severe infection also occurs in solid organ transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis/abstract/90,91\" class=\"abstract_t\">90,91</a>].

Most cases occur in the spring and summer, and in the United States, cases of HGA outnumber HME. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The principal vector of <em>E. chaffeensis</em> (agent of HME) is the Lone Star tick (<em>Amblyomma americanum</em>) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F71086\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71086 \">picture 3</a>). The vectors of <em>A. phagocytophilum</em> (agent of HGA) are <em>Ixodes scapularis</em> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73802\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73802 \">picture 4</a>) in the eastern United States and <em>Ixodes pacificus</em> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F60501\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60501 \">picture 5</a>) in the western United States. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Tick vectors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both forms of ehrlichiosis typically present as an acute illness with an incubation period of one to two weeks. Most patients are febrile, with nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgia, headache, and chills. One feature that may distinguish HME from HGA is a rash, which is present in about 30 percent of patients with HME but is rare in patients with HGA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50677\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50677 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common laboratory abnormalities in patients with HME and HGA, occurring in 50 to 90 percent of patients, are leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated plasma levels of aminotransferases (transaminases). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical and epidemiologic features of both HGA and HME overlap with those of Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), often making it difficult to distinguish between these three disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50677\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50677 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The preferred and most widely available diagnostic method for ehrlichiosis is the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment should be initiated in all patients suspected of having ehrlichiosis or anaplasmosis. We recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> as the drug of choice in all nonpregnant patients (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Recommended approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> in pregnant patients when the infection is considered life-threatening (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Estimated mortality rates are 2 to 5 percent for HME and as high as 7 to 10 percent for HGA. However, these rates are almost certainly overestimates, since many patients have subclinical illness. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Morbidity and mortality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In areas where tick borne pathogens other than ehrlichiosis are not a consideration, we suggest that patients with tick bites not be treated with prophylactic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preventive measures include the use of tick repellants such as DEET (N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=permethrin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">permethrin</a> and a prompt examination and removal of ticks, if found, after exposure to tick-infested environments.
