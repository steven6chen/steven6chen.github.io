In resource-rich settings, many diarrheal pathogens are transmitted through contaminated food or water, sometimes resulting in outbreaks with several or multiple affected individuals. The infectious etiologies of acute diarrhea and other foodborne illnesses in resource-rich countries will be reviewed here. </p><p>The approach to evaluation and management of acute diarrhea in adults and children in resource-rich settings is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-diarrhea-in-resource-rich-settings\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with acute diarrhea in resource-rich settings&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to diarrhea in children in resource-rich countries&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The approach to acute diarrhea in resource-limited settings is also discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-diarrhea-in-resource-limited-countries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with acute diarrhea in resource-limited countries&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-acute-diarrhea-in-resource-limited-countries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with acute diarrhea in resource-limited countries&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1823851406\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL CLUES TO THE MICROBIAL CAUSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most patients with acute diarrhea or other foodborne illness, the precise causative pathogen cannot be reliably distinguished based on clinical presentation alone. However, there are certain features that raise the probability of certain pathogens over others (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F116097\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116097 \">table 1</a>). These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The specific clinical manifestations &ndash; Among patients presenting with acute diarrhea, the most likely causative pathogens differ between watery diarrhea, in which small bowel pathogens predominate, and inflammatory diarrhea (with fever and bloody or mucoid stool), in which large bowel pathogens predominate. (See <a href=\"#H898566633\" class=\"local\">'Watery diarrhea'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1621185219\" class=\"local\">'Inflammatory diarrhea'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Most foodborne infections will typically manifest as a mixture of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort. With certain pathogens, vomiting rather than diarrhea may predominate (see <a href=\"#H2779282270\" class=\"local\">'Vomiting'</a> below). Furthermore, some foodborne diseases are characterized by non-gastrointestinal symptoms that can be distinctive and suggestive of the cause. Examples include botulism, ciguatera fish poisoning or scombroid, and <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em> central nervous system infection. (See <a href=\"#H2219469571\" class=\"local\">'Non-gastrointestinal syndromes'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The exposure history &ndash; For patients with diarrhea or other suspected foodborne illness, identifying the particular food exposure can potentially suggest certain pathogens, particularly if the illness is occurring in the setting of an outbreak connected to a known food source (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F58714\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58714 \">table 2</a>). Additionally, the timing of symptom onset following exposure to the suspect food can be informative. Ingested preformed toxins (eg, those produced by <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and <em>Bacillus cereus</em>) cause illness within hours of exposure, whereas ingested pathogens that subsequently produce toxin (eg, enterotoxigenic <em>Escherichia coli</em>) or directly damage or invade across the intestinal epithelial cell wall (eg, <em>Salmonella</em>, <em>Campylobacter</em>, <em>Shigella</em>) usually result in symptoms after approximately 24 hours or longer. Protozoal pathogens (eg, <em>Cryptosporidium parvum</em>) generally produce enteric illness after an incubation period of approximately seven days.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Not all cases of acute diarrhea are food- or waterborne. Other important exposures include animal contact, travel to resource-limited settings, occupation (eg, in daycare centers), and recent antibiotic use or health care exposures. </p><p/><p>Details on the evaluation of patients with acute diarrhea and indications for testing to identify the microbiologic cause are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-diarrhea-in-resource-rich-settings\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with acute diarrhea in resource-rich settings&quot;</a>.).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H670770239\"><span class=\"h1\">DIARRHEA</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Burden of disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute infectious diarrhea in resource-rich countries is very common, although the overall burden has not been as well studied as in resource-limited settings. Population-based surveys of self-reported diarrheal illness in various resource-rich settings suggest an incidence of acute diarrhea illness of approximately one episode per person per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-acute-infectious-diarrhea-and-other-foodborne-illnesses-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>]. </p><p>Insight into the burden of foodborne illnesses has also been provided by analysis of outbreaks reported to public health institutions. In the United States between 1998 and 2008, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) received reports of over 13,000 foodborne disease outbreaks, which were associated with approximately 270,000 illnesses, 9000 hospitalizations, and 200 deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-acute-infectious-diarrhea-and-other-foodborne-illnesses-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3970604294\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview of causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infectious or noninfectious causes may be responsible for acute diarrhea and, in selected patients, both can occur simultaneously. Among infectious causes, a wide variety of pathogens cause acute diarrhea and other foodborne illnesses in resource-rich settings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F75429\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75429 \">table 3</a>). </p><p>It is useful to categorize infectious diarrheal diseases by the portion of the intestine that they are prone to infect, since the presenting symptoms vary by region of the intestine involved in disease; this, in turn, can suggest involvement of particular pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-acute-infectious-diarrhea-and-other-foodborne-illnesses-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The small bowel functions as a fluid- and enzyme-secretory and nutrient-absorbing organ. Dysregulation of these two processes due to infections of the small bowel leads to a watery diarrhea that occurs in large volume and is associated with abdominal cramping, bloating, gas, and weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-acute-infectious-diarrhea-and-other-foodborne-illnesses-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. For the most part, when only small bowel is involved, fever is rarely a significant symptom, and the stool does not contain occult blood or inflammatory cells. Enteric viruses (and specifically norovirus) are the most common causes of watery diarrhea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F116097\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116097 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H898566633\" class=\"local\">'Watery diarrhea'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main function of the large bowel is to absorb fluid and salt and to excrete potassium. Thus, large intestinal diarrheas present with frequent, regular, small-volume, often painful bowel movements. Fever and bloody or mucoid stools are common, and red blood cells and inflammatory cells can be seen routinely on the stool smear. Bacterial pathogens are more common causes of inflammatory, large intestinal diarrhea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F116097\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116097 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1621185219\" class=\"local\">'Inflammatory diarrhea'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2200733743\"><span class=\"h3\">Most common causes overall</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The causes of infectious diarrhea vary from region to region, from rural to urban settings, and depending on co-morbidities, such as HIV or other immune-compromising conditions. In general, however, most cases of acute infectious diarrhea are caused by viruses, in particular norovirus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F75429\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75429 \">table 3</a>). </p><p>Testing for viral pathogens has not traditionally been routinely performed, but the primary role of viruses in diarrheal illness is supported by the infrequency of positive bacterial stool cultures in patients with acute diarrhea (approximately 1.5 to 9 percent of cases in most studies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-acute-infectious-diarrhea-and-other-foodborne-illnesses-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/11-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-17</a>]. In one study that used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in addition to culture for identification, a bacterial pathogen was identified in 15 percent of 1656 cases of acute diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-acute-infectious-diarrhea-and-other-foodborne-illnesses-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Bacterial pathogens are more likely to be involved in cases of severe or bloody diarrhea or in outbreak situations. (See <a href=\"#H4226996491\" class=\"local\">'Severe or bloody diarrhea'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3949334766\" class=\"local\">'Outbreaks'</a> below.)</p><p>Among bacterial and parasitic causes of acute diarrhea, nontyphoidal <em>Salmonella</em> and <em>Campylobacter</em> spp are the most common causes in the United States. The CDC runs an active surveillance program, FoodNet, which collects data on laboratory-confirmed diarrheal infections with seven bacterial and two parasitic pathogens from ten states, covering approximately 15 percent of the national population. </p><p>The incidence of culture-confirmed cases per 100,000 persons in 2016 was estimated by the FoodNet survey as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-acute-infectious-diarrhea-and-other-foodborne-illnesses-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Salmonella</em> &ndash; 15.4</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Campylobacter</em> &ndash; 11.8</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Shigella</em> &ndash; 4.6</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Cryptosporidium</em> &ndash; 3.7</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shiga toxin-producing <em>E. coli </em>&ndash; 2.8</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Vibrio</em> &ndash; 0.45</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Yersinia</em> &ndash; 0.42</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Listeria</em> &ndash; 0.26</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Cyclospora</em> &ndash; not calculated (only 55 cases recorded)</p><p/><p>Relative frequencies of bacterial and parasitic pathogens are generally comparable in other resource-rich settings, with some exceptions. In a prospective study of acute gastroenteritis in the United Kingdom, the most common bacterial isolate was <em>Campylobacter</em>, in 4.6 and 13 percent of community and general practice cases, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-acute-infectious-diarrhea-and-other-foodborne-illnesses-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. <em>Salmonella</em>, enterohemorrhagic <em>E. coli</em>, <em>Shigella</em>, <em>Yersinia</em>, <em>Listeria</em>, <em>Giardia</em>, <em>Cryptosporidium</em>, and <em>Cyclospora</em> were uncommon; each was identified in less than 1 percent of overall cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4226996491\"><span class=\"h3\">Severe or bloody diarrhea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bacteria are more likely pathogens in cases of severe or bloody diarrhea compared with milder watery diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-acute-infectious-diarrhea-and-other-foodborne-illnesses-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/18,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,20-22</a>]. </p><p>This was illustrated in a study of 173 healthy adults with severe acute community-acquired diarrhea (defined as &ge;4 fluid stools per day for more than three days); a bacterial pathogen was identified in 87 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-acute-infectious-diarrhea-and-other-foodborne-illnesses-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], much more frequently than seen with acute diarrhea in general. (See <a href=\"#H2200733743\" class=\"local\">'Most common causes overall'</a> above.)</p><p>With bloody diarrhea, the likelihood of particular bacteria, including <em>E. coli</em> O157:H7, is also higher. In a prospective study that evaluated approximately 550 episodes of reported bloody diarrhea for which stool cultures were obtained, a bacterial pathogen was identified in 31 percent of specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-acute-infectious-diarrhea-and-other-foodborne-illnesses-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. <em>Shigella</em> was the most common isolate (49 percent), followed by <em>Campylobacter</em> (20 percent), <em>Salmonella</em> (19 percent), and <em>E. coli</em> O157:H7 (8 percent). In an earlier study that included approximately 900 visibly bloody stool specimens, <em>E. coli</em> O157:H7 accounted for 39 percent of cultured isolates from visibly bloody specimens but only 7 percent of cultured isolates from all stools (bloody and nonbloody). Bloody diarrhea was much less common in patients with culture-negative diarrhea. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3949334766\"><span class=\"h3\">Outbreaks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Outbreaks of diarrheal illnesses are most often related to food sources, but can also be associated with animal contacts and recreational water exposure (eg, swimming or wading pools). </p><p>Foodborne outbreaks are most commonly associated with norovirus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-acute-infectious-diarrhea-and-other-foodborne-illnesses-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/7,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,23,24</a>]. As an example, in the United States between 1998 and 2008, the CDC received reports of over 13,000 foodborne disease outbreaks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-acute-infectious-diarrhea-and-other-foodborne-illnesses-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Overall, norovirus was the most commonly identified causative pathogen, causing 43 percent of the 8000 outbreaks with a confirmed or suspected single etiology. <em>Salmonella</em> was the second most common etiology (18 percent). Outbreaks due to viruses were most commonly associated with leafy vegetables, whereas bacterial outbreaks were most commonly associated with poultry and beef.</p><p>Waterborne outbreaks associated with recreational water exposure (eg, swimming or wading pools) are another source of acute diarrhea and commonly involve other pathogens. They have been associated most frequently with <em>Cryptosporidium</em> (50 percent) with treated water sources and with toxigenic <em>E. coli</em> (25 percent) and norovirus (25 percent) with freshwater sources [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-acute-infectious-diarrhea-and-other-foodborne-illnesses-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H139241034\"><span class=\"h3\">Noninfectious causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Noninfectious causes of acute diarrhea include drug adverse effects, food allergies, primary gastrointestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, and other disease states, such as thyrotoxicosis and the carcinoid syndrome. (See appropriate topic reviews for more details.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H898566633\"><span class=\"h2\">Watery diarrhea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many pathogens can cause watery diarrhea (usually of large volume and associated with abdominal bloating, without fever or bloody stools). In resource-rich countries, the most common causes are enteric viruses, specifically norovirus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F116097\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116097 \">table 1</a>). <em>Clostridium difficile</em> (which is also associated with inflammatory diarrhea), <em>Clostridium perfringens</em>, enterotoxigenic <em>E. coli</em> (ETEC), <em>Giardia lamblia, </em>and <em>Cryptosporidium parvum</em> are also important pathogens. </p><p>Pathogens that are more classically associated with inflammatory diarrhea can also cause watery diarrhea, particularly early in the course of infection. (See <a href=\"#H1621185219\" class=\"local\">'Inflammatory diarrhea'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2995510370\"><span class=\"h3\">Norovirus and other enteric viruses</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Norovirus</strong> &ndash; Norovirus (also known as Norwalk-like virus) is an extremely common cause of watery diarrhea. In the United States, over one-third of outbreaks of gastroenteritis have been associated with noroviruses. They appear to have a low infectious dose (around 10 particles) and are readily transmitted from the vomitus and the stool of an infected person (including through contaminated prepared food), and may also be transmitted in aerosol form or via person-to-person contact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-acute-infectious-diarrhea-and-other-foodborne-illnesses-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Noroviruses are responsible for the epidemic form of family- and community-wide outbreaks of acute explosive vomiting and diarrhea. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Symptoms generally begin 24 to 48 hours after exposure and last for 48 to 72 hours. Recovery is rapid and full but does not result in long-lasting immunity. If needed for public health reasons or in the case of severe infection, diagnosis can be made by antigen detection through enzyme immunoassay or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based assays. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norovirus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Norovirus&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other viruses</strong> &ndash; Rotavirus, enteric adenoviruses (eg, adenovirus serotypes 40 and 41), astrovirus, and sapovirus predominantly cause infection in children. In adults, diarrhea associated with these viruses has been described mainly in immunocompromised or institutionalized patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-viral-gastroenteritis-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute viral gastroenteritis in children in resource-rich countries: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1646699013\"><span class=\"h3\">Clostridium difficile</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>C. difficile</em>-associated diarrhea is one of the most common hospital-associated infections. It is typically associated with recent antibiotic use. However, severe cases have also been described in patients classically considered at low risk, including healthy individuals in the community without those traditional risk factors and peripartum women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-acute-infectious-diarrhea-and-other-foodborne-illnesses-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Clinicians should thus consider the diagnosis of <em>C. difficile </em>infection in all patients with severe diarrhea. <em>C. difficile </em>can sometimes be associated with inflammatory diarrhea (with fever and bloody or mucoid diarrhea) as well. </p><p>The epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of <em>C. difficile</em> are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clostridium difficile infection in adults: Epidemiology, microbiology, and pathophysiology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clostridium difficile infection in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clostridium difficile infection in adults: Treatment and prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2844962916\"><span class=\"h3\">Clostridium perfringens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>C. perfringens</em> is an important cause of foodborne, toxin-mediated watery diarrhea in resource-rich settings. In the United States, it is thought to be the second most common cause of foodborne bacterial infection (behind nontyphoidal <em>Salmonella </em>spp), with an estimated one million illnesses each year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-acute-infectious-diarrhea-and-other-foodborne-illnesses-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, <em>C. perfringens</em> is less frequently reported as a cause of outbreaks since symptoms are relatively mild and testing is not routinely performed.</p><p>Type A strains cause typical foodborne outbreaks. <em>C. perfringens</em> spores can survive normal cooking temperatures and can germinate and proliferate in foods that are improperly stored. Outbreaks are most commonly associated with inadequately heated or reheated meats, poultry, or gravy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-acute-infectious-diarrhea-and-other-foodborne-illnesses-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Following ingestion of a large quantity of organisms with the food, <em>C. perfringens</em> releases an enterotoxin in the gastrointestinal tract resulting in watery diarrhea and abdominal cramping. Vomiting and fever can occur but are uncommon. The incubation period ranges from 6 to 24 hours (usually 10 to 12 hours) and symptoms generally resolve within 24 to 48 hours. Restaurants and catering facilities are the most frequent food sources; outbreaks occur year-round, with a median size of approximately 20 individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-acute-infectious-diarrhea-and-other-foodborne-illnesses-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Outbreaks have also been described in inpatient psychiatric facilities; it has been postulated that antipsychotic (and other) medications impair intestinal mobility and increase susceptibility to infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-acute-infectious-diarrhea-and-other-foodborne-illnesses-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p><em>C. perfringens</em>-associated diarrhea should be suspected in single-source outbreaks that involve improperly cooked or stored meat. Both stool and food should be tested for the bacteria and the toxin. These tests are generally performed at reference laboratories. Infection is confirmed with a positive stool culture (ie, growth of at least 10<sup>6 </sup>colony-forming units [CFU] <em>C. perfringens</em> per gram). <em>C. perfringens</em> can be confirmed as the source of an outbreak when stool cultures are positive from at least two affected individuals, when enterotoxin is detected in stool from at least two affected individuals, or when culture of the suspect food source grows at least 10<sup>5</sup> CFU <em>C. perfringens</em> per gram [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-acute-infectious-diarrhea-and-other-foodborne-illnesses-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Supportive care, including oral or intravenous hydration, is warranted to prevent or treat volume depletion, but antibiotic treatment is unnecessary, as the infection is characteristically self-limited.</p><p>Type C strains produces a beta toxin, which can cause hemorrhagic necrosis of the jejunum, called enteritis necroticans or pigbel. Pigbel usually occurs in resource-limited countries (particularly Papua New Guinea) following pork consumption, but has been rarely described in the United States (in association with consumption of pig intestines [chitterlings]) and other resource-rich settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-acute-infectious-diarrhea-and-other-foodborne-illnesses-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. The simultaneous ingestion of sweet potatoes, which contain trypsin inhibitors preventing the intestinal degradation of the toxin, may be a potentiating factor.

For most patients, the precise causative pathogen cannot be reliably distinguished based on clinical presentation alone. However, certain clinical features raise the likelihood of certain pathogens over others. These features include the precise clinical manifestations (watery versus inflammatory diarrhea or extra-intestinal manifestations) and the exposure history (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F116097\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116097 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1823851406\" class=\"local\">'Clinical clues to the microbial cause'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The causes of infectious diarrhea vary from region to region, from rural to urban settings, and depending on co-morbidities, such as HIV or other immune-compromising conditions. In general, however, most cases of acute infectious diarrhea are caused by viruses, in particular norovirus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F75429\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75429 \">table 3</a>). Bacteria are more likely pathogens in cases of severe or bloody diarrhea. <em>Salmonella</em> and <em>Campylobacter</em> are the generally the most common bacterial causes. (See <a href=\"#H3970604294\" class=\"local\">'Overview of causes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other than norovirus, important causes of watery diarrhea include <em>Clostridium perfringens</em>, enterotoxigenic <em>Escherichia coli</em> (ETEC), and <em>Cryptosporidium parvum</em>. The clinical presentation of <em>Clostridium difficile</em> ranges from watery to more inflammatory diarrhea. (See <a href=\"#H898566633\" class=\"local\">'Watery diarrhea'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other than <em>Salmonella</em> and <em>Campylobacter</em>, important causes of inflammatory diarrhea (characterized by fever, severe abdominal pain, and bloody or mucoid diarrhea) include <em>Shigella</em>, enterohemorrhagic <em>E. coli</em>, and <em>Yersinia</em>. (See <a href=\"#H1621185219\" class=\"local\">'Inflammatory diarrhea'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The sudden onset of nausea and vomiting is likely due to the ingestion of a preformed toxin, such as <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> enterotoxin or <em>Bacillus cereus</em> emetic toxin, or a chemical irritant. Viral gastroenteritis also often presents with vomiting as the predominant symptom. (See <a href=\"#H2779282270\" class=\"local\">'Vomiting'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some foodborne pathogens cause serious illness but are not predominantly associated with gastrointestinal disease. Important examples include botulism, ciguatera or other toxin poisoning, <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em> bacteremia or central nervous system infection, scombroid, and hepatitis A virus infection.
