Most people develop only minor local reactions, but patients with venom allergy are at risk for systemic allergic reactions (ie, anaphylaxis), which can be particularly severe and are a leading cause of anaphylaxis fatalities. There are also several uncommon and delayed types of reactions that may develop after Hymenoptera stings, such as serum sickness.</p><p>This topic reviews the types of reactions that result from Hymenoptera stings, including local reactions and systemic allergic reactions, and the acute management of each. The diagnosis and long-term management of Hymenoptera allergy are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-hymenoptera-venom-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of Hymenoptera venom allergy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-efficacy-indications-and-mechanism-of-action\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hymenoptera venom immunotherapy: Efficacy, indications, and mechanism of action&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The insects that are responsible for the majority of serious sting-related reactions belong to the order Hymenoptera. The Hymenoptera families of medical interest include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bee-yellow-jacket-wasp-and-other-hymenoptera-stings-reaction-types-and-acute-management/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]:</p><p>The winged Hymenoptera:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apidae family (honey bees (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F79579\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79579 \">picture 1</a>) and bumble bees).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vespidae family (yellow jackets (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F79706\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79706 \">picture 2</a>), yellow hornets, white-faced hornets, and paper wasps (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F70439\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70439 \">picture 3</a>)).</p><p/><p>The wingless Hymenoptera:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Formicidae family (fire ants (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F82396\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82396 \">picture 4</a>), harvester ants, bulldog ants, and jack jumper ants). The clinical manifestations and treatment of fire ant stings are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stings of imported fire ants: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Hymenoptera generally sting people in self-defense or to protect their nests or hives. Their stings are acutely painful, and patients are aware that a sting has occurred, although they may not have visualized the insect. Identification of the responsible winged Hymenoptera species can be difficult since the resultant lesions are similar in appearance. A culprit species can sometimes be identified based upon nest location and appearance, geographic location, or setting in which the sting occurred. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stinging-insects-biology-and-identification\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stinging insects: Biology and identification&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H531249095\"><span class=\"h2\">Insect and stinger removal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bees (and occasionally yellow jackets) have a barbed stinging apparatus that becomes lodged in the skin and rips away, along with the venom sac, from the insect's body following a sting event. The venom is released within the first several seconds after the sting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bee-yellow-jacket-wasp-and-other-hymenoptera-stings-reaction-types-and-acute-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], so if the insect or stinger can be flicked off of the skin immediately, it may help limit the amount of venom injected. However, if the patient presents minutes later, immediate stinger removal is not critical, because the venom will have already been fully expelled. Remaining stingers should eventually be removed because they can occasionally cause foreign body reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bee-yellow-jacket-wasp-and-other-hymenoptera-stings-reaction-types-and-acute-management/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>Imported fire ants grasp the skin firmly with their mandibles and inflict multiple stings per insect, so these should be promptly removed as well.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">LOCAL REACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Local reactions consist of symptoms that are confined to the tissues contiguous with the sting site. They are usually mild and transient, although some patients develop large local reactions (LLRs) or (rarely) secondary bacterial infections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Uncomplicated local reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A typical local reaction to a Hymenoptera sting is redness and an area of painful swelling (1 to 5 cm) at the site of the sting that develops within minutes and resolves within a few hours (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F81060\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81060 \">picture 5</a>). Occasionally, swelling may last one to two days. Uncomplicated local reactions may be treated with cold compresses.</p><p>Imported fire ant stings typically cause pustule-like lesions at the site of the sting(s) within about 24 hours (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F76841\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76841 \">picture 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bee-yellow-jacket-wasp-and-other-hymenoptera-stings-reaction-types-and-acute-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. These pseudopustules are sterile, and patients should be advised not to open them, as this can lead to infection. In the absence of this advice, patients tend to unroof the lesions, either because of the intense pruritus associated with fire ant stings or because conventional wisdom dictates &quot;draining the infection&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bee-yellow-jacket-wasp-and-other-hymenoptera-stings-reaction-types-and-acute-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Additional measures for the care of local reactions to fire ant stings are presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stings of imported fire ants: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Large local reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 10 percent of individuals develop exaggerated redness and swelling at the site of the sting that gradually enlarges over one to two days (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F97002\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97002 \">picture 7</a>). This response is called a large local reaction (LLR). LLRs peak at approximately 48 hours and then gradually resolve over 5 to 10 days. The area of swelling typically measures about 10 cm in diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bee-yellow-jacket-wasp-and-other-hymenoptera-stings-reaction-types-and-acute-management/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of LLRs is based upon symptoms. We know of no published studies comparing different treatments. Our approach is described below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cold compresses are soothing acutely. The limb should be elevated if the sting is on an extremity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 40 to 60 mg given as a single dose or rapidly tapered over two to five days may help reduce significant swelling.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can reduce pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pruritus can be treated with oral antihistamines (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetirizine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetirizine</a>, 10 mg once daily) and high potency topical corticosteroids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluocinonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluocinonide</a> 0.05 percent or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobetasol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clobetasol</a> 0.05 percent ointment, applied every four hours) until the itching subsides.</p><p/><p>Hymenoptera stings are considered &quot;clean&quot; for the purposes of tetanus vaccination. Stings are very superficial, and there are no published reports of tetanus infection following Hymenoptera stings. A tetanus booster is not necessary following a sting unless there was a concomitant soil-contaminated injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetanus-diphtheria-toxoid-vaccination-in-adults#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tetanus-diphtheria toxoid vaccination in adults&quot;, section on 'Immunization for patients with injuries'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Excluding a secondary bacterial infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most Hymenoptera stings do not become superinfected, although this can occur. An infected sting must be differentiated from an LLR. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Large local reactions'</a> above.)</p><p>Infection is suspected when redness, swelling, and pain become dramatically worse three to five days after the sting, when the typical LLR is beginning to regress. The presence of fever suggests infection, but lymphangitis streaks may be seen with either infection or an uncomplicated LLR. If the clinician is unsure, a course of oral antibiotics may be prudent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cellulitis-and-skin-abscess-in-adults-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cellulitis and skin abscess in adults: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The stings of yellow jackets and imported fire ants are more likely to become infected than those of other species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bee-yellow-jacket-wasp-and-other-hymenoptera-stings-reaction-types-and-acute-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Yellow jackets tend to scavenge around rotting food and presumably carry bacteria on their exterior. Fire ant stings cause sterile pustule-like lesions that can become infected if opened.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Future risk of systemic reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a history of an LLR often have the same response to subsequent stings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bee-yellow-jacket-wasp-and-other-hymenoptera-stings-reaction-types-and-acute-management/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. It is not known if the risk of recurrent LLRs changes over time or is influenced by the frequency of stings. The risk for a systemic allergic reaction in the future is approximately 7 percent (4 to 10 percent), based on observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bee-yellow-jacket-wasp-and-other-hymenoptera-stings-reaction-types-and-acute-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, the risk of moderate or severe anaphylaxis is lower and estimated at 1 to 3 percent. Most of the reactions that are more severe in the future are still limited to the skin (widespread urticaria and angioedema) and are called cutaneous systemic reactions (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-efficacy-indications-and-mechanism-of-action#H2380887395\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hymenoptera venom immunotherapy: Efficacy, indications, and mechanism of action&quot;, section on 'Patients with past cutaneous systemic reactions'</a>). Therefore, most patients with LLRs are not offered venom immunotherapy or told to carry an <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> autoinjector.</p><p>A minority of patients (or caregivers) with LLRs will be anxious about the small (1 to 3 percent) risk of a serious systemic reaction to future stings. Patients with very frequent exposure to Hymenoptera may also be concerned. In this situation, we discuss the <span class=\"nowrap\">patients'/caregivers'</span> concerns in detail and prescribe an <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> autoinjector only if it will clearly reduce anxiety. Note that there is some evidence that being told to carry an epinephrine autoinjector is associated with a decrease in quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bee-yellow-jacket-wasp-and-other-hymenoptera-stings-reaction-types-and-acute-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], and we find most patients are reassured by low risk of serious reaction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30381667\"><span class=\"h3\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LLRs are believed to be immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated based upon the following evidence:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The frequency of positive venom skin tests or venom-specific serum IgE is the same in patients with LLRs as in those with anaphylactic reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bee-yellow-jacket-wasp-and-other-hymenoptera-stings-reaction-types-and-acute-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one patient, large local reactivity to fire ant stings was transferred passively (using the Prausnitz-Kustner reaction) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bee-yellow-jacket-wasp-and-other-hymenoptera-stings-reaction-types-and-acute-management/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Also in this report, eosinophils, which are found in the late phase of IgE-mediated allergic reactions, were demonstrated in biopsy specimens from patients with fire ant-induced LLRs but not in specimens from patients without LLRs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both sting-induced anaphylaxis and LLRs can be treated with venom immunotherapy, a technique classically applied to IgE-mediated reactions. Although most patients with LLRs are not treated with venom immunotherapy, treatment can be considered for those wishing to lower the risk of future anaphylaxis further or who have frequent stings and wish to take measures to reduce the severity of future LLRs (and the need for glucocorticoid treatment). The indications for venom immunotherapy are reviewed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-efficacy-indications-and-mechanism-of-action\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hymenoptera venom immunotherapy: Efficacy, indications, and mechanism of action&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The reason that patients with past LLRs are at low risk for future anaphylaxis while those with past systemic allergic reactions are at high risk, when both reactions appear to be IgE-mediated, is unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H531245181\"><span class=\"h3\">Prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some individuals develop predictable LLRs with every Hymenoptera sting and seek advice on how to prevent this. Our clinical experience is that administration of a single dose of 20 to 60 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (depending upon the historical severity of the LLR) within two hours of the sting often attenuates the response.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">SYSTEMIC ALLERGIC REACTIONS/ANAPHYLAXIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most dangerous immediate reaction to Hymenoptera stings is a systemic allergic reaction, or anaphylaxis (the terms are used interchangeably in this review). Anaphylaxis may be defined as a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bee-yellow-jacket-wasp-and-other-hymenoptera-stings-reaction-types-and-acute-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Venom-induced anaphylaxis involves signs and symptoms in one or more anatomic systems distant from the site of the sting.</p><p>A single sting is sufficient to precipitate a severe reaction in a venom-allergic individual, and insect stings are a leading cause of fatal anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bee-yellow-jacket-wasp-and-other-hymenoptera-stings-reaction-types-and-acute-management/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Venom-induced anaphylaxis can be particularly severe, sometimes persisting despite multiple doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bee-yellow-jacket-wasp-and-other-hymenoptera-stings-reaction-types-and-acute-management/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology of venom anaphylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anaphylaxis is reported in 0.3 to 3 percent of stings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bee-yellow-jacket-wasp-and-other-hymenoptera-stings-reaction-types-and-acute-management/abstract/17,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,21,22</a>], affecting up to 8 percent of some populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bee-yellow-jacket-wasp-and-other-hymenoptera-stings-reaction-types-and-acute-management/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Hymenoptera stings cause at least 40 identified deaths annually in the United States, and reported rates are similar in other parts of the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bee-yellow-jacket-wasp-and-other-hymenoptera-stings-reaction-types-and-acute-management/abstract/23,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,25,26</a>]. The true incidence of fatal reactions may be higher because sudden deaths occurring outdoors may be mistakenly attributed to heart attacks or strokes. One study found a high frequency of venom-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) in the postmortem serum of individuals who had died suddenly of unknown cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bee-yellow-jacket-wasp-and-other-hymenoptera-stings-reaction-types-and-acute-management/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Even more suspicious is the presence of both elevated serum tryptase (a mediator that is released from mast cells and basophils during anaphylaxis) and venom IgE in deaths of unknown cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bee-yellow-jacket-wasp-and-other-hymenoptera-stings-reaction-types-and-acute-management/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The utility of tryptase measurements in the postmortem diagnosis of anaphylaxis is reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-tests-to-support-the-clinical-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory tests to support the clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An American survey study of the general population found that approximately 3 percent of people reported experiencing some systemic symptom after a Hymenoptera sting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bee-yellow-jacket-wasp-and-other-hymenoptera-stings-reaction-types-and-acute-management/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Since approximately 60 to 90 percent of patients with a suggestive clinical history have venom-specific IgE upon evaluation, an estimated 2 percent of the adult population (and 0.5 percent of children) could have venom allergy.</p><p>About one-half of patients who die as a result of Hymenoptera-induced anaphylaxis did not know that they had an allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bee-yellow-jacket-wasp-and-other-hymenoptera-stings-reaction-types-and-acute-management/abstract/23,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,30</a>]. In the survey mentioned previously, the majority of patients who reported past systemic symptoms had not sought medical attention. Thus, venom allergy is very likely under-recognized and underdiagnosed.</p><p>Venom allergy can develop at any age, but adults suffer more severe reactions, and most deaths occur in this age group. Men are affected more often than women, probably due to a greater prevalence of outdoor occupations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bee-yellow-jacket-wasp-and-other-hymenoptera-stings-reaction-types-and-acute-management/abstract/18,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,30</a>]. Not surprisingly, beekeepers are at highest risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bee-yellow-jacket-wasp-and-other-hymenoptera-stings-reaction-types-and-acute-management/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Patients with concomitant cardiovascular disease and a poor tolerance for biochemical and physiologic stress are at particular risk for severe and fatal anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bee-yellow-jacket-wasp-and-other-hymenoptera-stings-reaction-types-and-acute-management/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fatal-anaphylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fatal anaphylaxis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>One to 2 percent of patients with severe anaphylactic reactions following Hymenoptera stings are subsequently found to have clonal mast cell disease (eg, cutaneous and systemic mastocytosis, as well as other clonal mast cell disorders) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bee-yellow-jacket-wasp-and-other-hymenoptera-stings-reaction-types-and-acute-management/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. These patients may have a characteristic dermatitis called urticaria pigmentosa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F63025\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63025 \">picture 8</a>) or report a history of multiple allergic reactions to various triggers.

Typically, symptoms initially escalate and then resolve in a uniphasic manner. However, a small percentage follows a biphasic course, in which the initial reaction is treated and resolves or resolves spontaneously, but there is a recurrence of symptoms hours later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bee-yellow-jacket-wasp-and-other-hymenoptera-stings-reaction-types-and-acute-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Three diagnostic criteria have been proposed, each reflecting a different clinical presentation of anaphylaxis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F72225\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72225 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bee-yellow-jacket-wasp-and-other-hymenoptera-stings-reaction-types-and-acute-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Anaphylaxis is highly likely when <strong>any one</strong> criterion is fulfilled. The diagnosis can be particularly challenging when cardiovascular signs and symptoms exist in isolation (eg, criterion 3). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-emergency-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Emergency treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of anaphylaxis can be further supported by the documentation of elevated concentrations of the mast cell and basophil mediators' histamine or total tryptase. Any elevation is consistent with anaphylaxis and indicates that these cells have been activated on a massive scale. These changes may be very transient, and normal levels do not exclude the diagnosis. It is critical to obtain blood samples for measurement of these mediators during specific windows of time after the onset of symptoms. Instructions for proper timing and collection of samples are provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F72041\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72041 \">table 3</a>).

The most common reactions to these stings are transient pain and redness at the site lasting a few hours (local reaction) and exaggerated swelling lasting a few days (large local reaction [LLR]). The most dangerous immediate reaction is anaphylaxis, which is potentially fatal.

The affected part should be elevated if possible. For severe swelling, we suggest administration of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).

Anaphylaxis is diagnosed clinically (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F72225\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72225 \">table 2</a>).
