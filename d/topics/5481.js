A single dose of Tdap should also be administered to pregnant adolescents during <strong>each</strong> pregnancy (as early as possible between 27 and 36 weeks of gestation), regardless of prior vaccination status.

(See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The preferred age for Tdap is 11 through 12 years.
