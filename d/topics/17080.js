The universal emergency airway management algorithm provides the recommended approach to emergency intubation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76711\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef76711 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63518\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef63518 \">algorithm 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. This approach is based on two key assessments of the patient prior to intubation.</p><p>The first assessment is to determine if the patient has a &quot;crash&quot; airway (ie, presenting in extremis with little or no cardiovascular or respiratory activity, and unlikely to respond to insertion of a laryngoscope). If so, the crash airway algorithm is used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73509\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73509 \">algorithm 3</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>If the patient is not a crash airway, the next step is to determine if the patient presents a difficult airway. This requires assessment of specific patient attributes to predict the likelihood of difficulty in performing any of the major procedures in airway management: direct laryngoscopy and intubation, bag-mask ventilation, surgical airway management, and ventilation using an extraglottic airway. </p><p>If the patient is felt to be neither a crash nor a difficult airway, then rapid sequence intubation is the recommended method for managing the airway. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation for adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The decision that the patient presents with a difficult airway is a critical determinant of the best approach to intubation. This topic review will discuss assessment and management of the difficult airway in adults. Other aspects of airway management, including pediatric airway management, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-difficult-pediatric-airway\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The difficult pediatric airway&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-endotracheal-intubation-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency endotracheal intubation in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-airway-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic airway management in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advanced-emergency-airway-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advanced emergency airway management in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation for adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence of difficult intubation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A difficult emergency department (ED) intubation can be defined as one that requires multiple attempts, multiple operators, multiple devices, excessive lifting force, external laryngeal manipulation, or is performed with an inadequate glottic view. The precise incidence of difficult intubation in the ED is unknown. </p><p>The third phase of the multicenter National Emergency Airway Registry (NEAR III) project analyzed over 17,500 ED intubations and found that in approximately 3 percent of cases, the airway ultimately was secured by a means other than the first method chosen. Approximately 0.5 percent of airways required a surgical airway, with 75 percent of these performed as a rescue after failure of another method. Using these data, and incorporating the success rate on first pass, use of a bougie or flexible fiberoptics, and cricothyrotomy rate, one would estimate the incidence of difficult airway in the ED at approximately 10 to 15 percent. The incidence of failed airway, defined as requiring an alternate instrument or operator is in the 3 to 5 percent range. Overall failure, meaning that no airway was secured, was rarely reported, but data were not available regarding whether hypoxic injury or other severe airway related injury might have occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Analysis of the NEAR data found that PGY-3 and PGY-4 residents in emergency medicine performed most intubations, with first attempt success rates of 80 percent for the Glidescope, 83 percent for direct laryngoscopy, and 90 percent with the C-MAC video laryngoscope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Fewer than 2 percent of intubations required more than three attempts. Ninety-seven percent of intubations by residents beyond the level of intern were successfully performed by the first operator. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=devices-for-difficult-emergency-airway-management-outside-the-operating-room-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Devices for difficult emergency airway management outside the operating room in adults&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p>A 2002 review estimated the incidence of difficult ED intubation at 30 percent, but variations in clinician expertise and experience greatly influence the subjective impression of intubation difficulty, and the need for additional equipment or operators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Furthermore, virtually all concepts of difficult ED intubation are predicated on difficulty obtaining an adequate glottic view using a direct laryngoscope and blade. A retrospective study of emergency intubations performed by anesthesiologists outside the operating room reported that 351 of 3423 intubations (10.3 percent) were difficult (Cormack-Lehane grade 3 or 4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In the NEAR III study, video laryngoscopy use increased from less than 2 percent in 2002 to 2004 to almost 30 percent after 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The concept of difficult intubation will change radically as video laryngoscopes, now widely used, replace traditional direct laryngoscopes for emergency intubation. </p><p>Difficult direct laryngoscopy correlates with the best view of the glottis, as defined by the Cormack-Lehane scale, in which a grade 1 view connotes a full view of the entire glottic aperture, grade 2 represents a partial glottic view, grade 3 represents visualization of the epiglottis only, and grade 4 represents inability to visualize even the epiglottis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55034\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55034 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>In the operating room, the incidence of grade 3 laryngoscopy is approximately 5 percent and true grade 4 laryngoscopy occurs in less than 1 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. These data are derived from selected cases, as patients with difficult airways are usually identified in advance and have planned airway interventions. In the ED, the incidence of grade 3 and 4 laryngoscopic views is likely to be much higher.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence of difficult bag-mask ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Difficult bag-mask ventilation (BMV) has been studied extensively in the operating room but not in the ED [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/8-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-14</a>]. Overall, although definitions vary among studies, the incidence of difficult BMV is universally low and true failed bag mask ventilation is rare.</p><p>Researchers in one prospective observational study of 1502 operating room patients defined difficult BMV as the inability of a single clinician to maintain oxygen saturation above 92 percent or provide adequate ventilation. They found BMV to be difficult in about 5 percent of patients, and impossible in only a single patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Subsequent, larger studies found difficult BMV to occur in approximately 3 percent of patients, with the lower incidence possibly due to exclusion of some patients who would have been difficult to ventilate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/9,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,15,16</a>]. In a cluster randomized trial of pre-assessment for difficult BMV involving 94,006 patients in 26 Danish anesthesia departments, researchers reported an incidence of unpredicted difficult BMV below one percent in both the intervention group, in which potential BMV difficulty was assessed using 11 explicit criteria, (0.91 percent), and the control group, in which assessment was left to the anesthesiologist&rsquo;s discretion (0.88 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Among the selected patients studied in the operating room, the combined presence of the inability to intubate and the inability to perform BMV occurs in only 1 in 5000 to 1 in 10,000 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This likely represents a reasonable estimate of the incidence of unexpected difficulty in the ED (ie, patients without identifiable characteristics associated with difficulty but for whom intubation and BMV are difficult). This observation underscores the safety of an approach to airway management that includes a preintubation assessment for difficult intubation and difficult BMV. In the absence of markers of difficult intubation or difficult BMV, the clinician will rarely encounter a patient who is both impossible to intubate and impossible to ventilate with a bag-mask. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-airway-management-in-adults#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic airway management in adults&quot;, section on 'Bag-mask ventilation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence of difficult cricothyrotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of difficult surgical cricothyrotomy in the ED, where the procedure is most often performed, or in the operating room (OR) is not known. Cricothyrotomy is not a technically difficult procedure in most patients, but infrequency of performance, lack of regular training, and the anxiety accompanying airway failure undoubtedly play key roles in any difficulty encountered.</p><p>Several case series of emergency surgical cricothyrotomies have reported success rates approaching 100 percent, with complication rates of 5 to 14 percent. Difficulty related to the procedure, including cases requiring excessive time to secure the airway, is not properly captured in these retrospective series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-cricothyrotomy-cricothyroidotomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency cricothyrotomy (cricothyroidotomy)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence of difficult extraglottic airways</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extraglottic airways are most often used as rescue devices in the ED. These include the supraglottic airways (ie, laryngeal mask airways), designed to sit just above the glottis, and the retro-glottic airways, designed to be inserted into the esophagus, and which provide proximal (oropharyngeal) and distal (esophageal) seals to permit &quot;side-stream&quot; ventilation (eg, Combitube, King LT Airway, EasyTube, and others).</p><p>The incidence of difficult insertion is not known for most of these devices. Disposable and reusable laryngeal mask airway devices have been shown to permit effective ventilation in 92 and 97 percent, respectively, of anesthetized patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Emergency medical technicians (EMT) have used the Combitube in the prehospital setting, obtaining ventilation rates ranging from 79 to 95 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. One retrospective review of 162 patients managed by EMTs reported a success rate of only 70 percent with a 27 percent complication rate using the Combitube [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In a single center registry of 14,480 elective OR cases managed with either an iGel or LMA, the rate of initial difficult ventilation was 0.5 percent; however, 60 percent were corrected with either repositioning or re-insertion. Overall, successful placement and ventilation occurred in 99.8 percent of all cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>Success rates for retroglottic airways used in the ED are unknown. Analysis of data from the NEAR registry showed extraglottic airways were seldom used as rescue devices and never used as a primary airway in 7712 ED patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Patients with disrupted upper airway anatomy are poor candidates for a supraglottic or retroglottic airway device, as both rely on creating a seal between an inflatable cuff and the patient's mucosa.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">IDENTIFICATION OF THE DIFFICULT AIRWAY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Failure to identify, in advance, characteristics associated with difficult intubation or ventilation is one of the leading causes of a failed airway in the operating room [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. This concept likely extends to emergency airway management outside the operating room. Difficult airway assessment requires determination of the potential for difficulty with bag-mask ventilation, laryngoscopy and intubation, cricothyrotomy, and extraglottic airway insertion. </p><p>Multiple studies have attempted to identify patient characteristics predictive of difficult laryngoscopy and intubation. Not all markers of difficulty are applicable to emergency department (ED) patients, and many are too complex or require evaluation (eg, MRI) that is not feasible in the emergency situation. Researchers in emergency airway management have developed mnemonics for evaluation of the difficult airway in the ED, based upon these studies and their practical experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. The mnemonic LEMON is discussed below (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64336\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64336 \">table 1</a>). A prospective observational study of 156 patients undergoing intubation in the ED found the LEMON evaluation accurately stratified patients according to the risk of difficult intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p>Subsequently, the LEMON mnemonic was adopted by the American College of Surgeons&rsquo; Advanced Trauma Life Support Course. The LEMON mnemonic applies to direct laryngoscopy, not to video laryngoscopy, although some of the attributes (eg, obesity) are likely to have some validity for video laryngoscopy as well. However, it will be challenging to develop predictors of difficult intubation using a video laryngoscope, as these instruments almost universally provide grade 1 or 2 views <span class=\"nowrap\">(400/400</span> grade 1 or 2 in one study of the Glidescope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>] and <span class=\"nowrap\">60/60</span> in a study using the Storz C-MAC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]). &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">The LEMON approach to difficult airway assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The LEMON rule uses a series of physical evaluations to determine whether difficult laryngoscopy is anticipated. Each step is described:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">L: Look externally</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This refers to the clinician's general impression that the airway will be difficult. Does the patient have abnormal facies or body habitus, unusual anatomy, or facial trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>], any of which can be expected to create difficulty? A general impression of airway difficulty is reasonably specific, but not particularly sensitive. If an operator observes the patient and anticipates difficulty, that assessment likely is correct. Conversely, absence of obvious external markers of airway difficulty does not ensure success.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">E: Evaluate (3-3-2 rule)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The size of the mandible, the distance between the mentum and the hyoid bone, and the extent of mouth opening are all important geometric determinants of the success of direct laryngoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. These relationships are represented by the 3-3-2 rule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60507\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60507 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. The rule describes three measurements found in normal patients (ie, patients in whom difficult laryngoscopy is <strong>NOT</strong> expected).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>3: This assessment indicates the ease of access to the airway. A normal patient can open his mouth sufficiently to permit three of his own fingers to be placed between the incisors. Adequate mouth opening facilitates both insertion of the laryngoscope and obtaining a direct view of the glottis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>3: This assessment provides an estimate of the volume of the submandibular space. A normal patient is able to place three of his fingers along the floor of the mandible between the mentum and the <span class=\"nowrap\">neck/mandible</span> junction (near the hyoid bone). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>2: This assessment identifies the location of the larynx relative to the base of the tongue. A normal patient is able to place two fingers in the superior laryngeal notch (ie, the space between the superior notch of the thyroid cartilage and the <span class=\"nowrap\">neck/mandible</span> junction, near the hyoid bone). If the larynx is too high in the neck, direct laryngoscopy is difficult or impossible because of the angles that have to be negotiated to permit visualization. </p><p/><p>Variations in patient size are accommodated by using the patient's fingers as the standard for measurement. Since the ED patient is often uncooperative or unable to perform the required steps, size is estimated by comparing the examiner's fingers with the patient's. The examiner's fingers are then used to estimate the proportions involved. Failure to achieve these three dimensions predicts difficulty visualizing the glottis during direct laryngoscopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">M: Mallampati score</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Mallampati classification is a simple scoring system to help predict difficult intubation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F75229\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75229 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. It has been prospectively validated in several studies, although not as a solitary (ie, sufficient) predictor of difficult intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. The Mallampati class, ranging from I to IV, relates the amount of mouth opening to the size of the tongue, and provides an estimate of space for oral intubation by direct laryngoscopy. In general, Mallampati class I or II predicts easy laryngoscopy, class III predicts difficulty, and class IV predicts extreme difficulty.</p><p>Many ED patients are unable to cooperate with a Mallampati assessment. In such cases, the examiner should gently open the mouth if possible and use a direct laryngoscope blade in the manner of a conventional tongue blade to assess the size of the tongue compared with that of the oropharynx. If this assessment reveals a large tongue to oropharynx ratio or it cannot be done, the clinician should assume that direct laryngoscopy will be difficult. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">O: Obstruction/Obesity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of upper airway obstruction interferes with both laryngoscopy and intubation. A supraglottic mass or infection, trauma with hematoma, injury with disruption of the upper airway, and vocal cord masses (eg, tumor), among other conditions, can obstruct the view of the glottis, block access for tube insertion by narrowing the airway, or both. The redundant tissues in the upper airway of the obese patient make visualization of the glottis by direct laryngoscopy more difficult, and an oversize laryngoscope blade may be required. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">N: Neck mobility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ideally, the patient is placed in the sniffing position for intubation. The sniffing position is achieved by flexing the neck forward on the body (thoracic spine) and elevating the head. Thus, decreased cervical spine mobility compromises the direct laryngoscopic view [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. Proper positioning for direct laryngoscopy is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation in adults&quot;, section on 'Positioning the patient'</a>.)</p><p>Medical conditions, such as psoriatic or rheumatoid arthritis, or ankylosing spondylitis, or simply the degenerative joint disease that accompanies aging, can greatly reduce neck mobility. In uncooperative, <strong>non</strong>trauma patients, neck mobility can be assessed by passively extending the neck.</p><p>Blunt trauma patients require in-line stabilization of the cervical spine during intubation, which also limits glottic view. Most trauma patients, although identified as difficult airways because they require in-line cervical spine stabilization, can nonetheless be intubated successfully orally, unless other difficult airway markers are present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Difficult bag-mask ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessment for difficult bag-mask ventilation (BMV) is performed immediately after the LEMON evaluation for difficult intubation. The LEMON evaluation and BMV technique are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'The LEMON approach to difficult airway assessment'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-airway-management-in-adults#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic airway management in adults&quot;, section on 'Bag-mask ventilation'</a>.)</p><p>Difficult BMV has been studied in anesthesia populations and the incidence appears to be low. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Incidence of difficult bag-mask ventilation'</a> above.)</p><p>The predictors of difficult BMV are summarized by the mnemonic ROMAN (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73627\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73627 \">table 2</a>) and discussed immediately below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/8,9,14,15,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,14,15,30</a>]. There is no clear correlation between each individual attribute and the degree of difficulty, but assessment of all the attributes helps to determine whether difficulty is likely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. If no markers are present, BMV is unlikely to be difficult. However, while uncommon, difficult BMV does occur and clinicians who perform airway management must be prepared.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>R: <span class=\"nowrap\">Radiation/Restriction</span> &ndash;</strong> Head and neck radiation is strongly associated with difficult rescue mask ventilation, likely due to reduced pliability of upper airway soft tissue. Restriction is used to connote restriction of forward gas flow (ie, from the bag and mask apparatus into the patient&rsquo;s lungs) and resistance to ventilation that occurs in conditions that increase the required inspiratory pressure to ventilate the lungs, and includes asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary edema, widespread infiltrates, and any other condition that decreases pulmonary compliance. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>O: <span class=\"nowrap\">Obstruction/Obesity/Obstructive</span> Sleep Apnea &ndash; </strong>Obstruction of the upper airway, although not widely studied, will make BMV more difficult, as increased pressures will be required to ensure that gas flows past the obstruction in both directions. Obesity (body mass index [BMI]&gt;26) is an independent marker of difficult BMV. Redundant upper airway tissue and the combination of chest wall weight and resistance from abdominal contents all impede airflow. Late third trimester pregnancy is a surrogate for obesity with respect to BMV, as it creates many of the same problems. Placing the bed at an angle with the head higher than the feet (ie, reverse Trendelenburg) may reduce impedance to airflow from abdominal weight.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>M: Mask <span class=\"nowrap\">Seal/Mallampati/Male</strong></span> &ndash; Mask seal requires reasonably normal anatomy, absence of facial hair, lack of interfering substances, such as excessive vomitus or bleeding, and the ability to apply pressure to the face with the mask. Poor Mallampati classification and male sex are associated with challenging mask ventilation as well.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>A: Age &ndash;</strong> In one study, age &gt;55 years was a marker of difficult BMV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Most likely the general loss of elasticity of tissues and the increased incidence of restrictive or obstructive pulmonary disease make ventilation more difficult. Fifty-five years is not a distinct cut-off, but as patients age, or appear to be physiologically aged, it is reasonable to assume that BMV difficulty will increase.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>N: No teeth &ndash;</strong> Edentulousness creates difficulty with BMV. Teeth provide a framework against which the mask sits and support the cheeks, enhancing mask seal. If a patient has dentures, they should be left in situ during BMV, where they are of benefit, then removed for direct laryngoscopy, where they are detrimental [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Difficult cricothyrotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessment for difficult cricothyrotomy is performed after the LEMON evaluation for difficult intubation and the ROMAN evaluation for difficult bag-mask ventilation. &#160;</p><p>Difficult cricothyrotomy is caused by difficult access to the anterior neck, inability to identify landmarks, distortion of the anatomy, or abnormalities of the tissues, and is assessed using the mnemonic SMART (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67468\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67468 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Evaluation for difficult cricothyrotomy requires palpating the structures overlying the larynx, identifying the cricothyroid membrane, and identifying potential problems with surgical access. Identification of the cricothyroid membrane is more difficult in the obese and in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Compared to bedside ultrasound, many commonly used palpation techniques for identifying the cricothyroid membrane are only marginally accurate (46 to 62 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Difficult extraglottic airway placement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Placement of a rescue device (eg, laryngeal mask airway) can be difficult if mouth opening is limited, if the airway is disrupted or distorted (eg, by swelling), or if debris such as teeth or bone fragments are present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71383\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71383 \">table 4</a>). Increased airway resistance can prevent effective ventilation via an extraglottic airway.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">THE DIFFICULT AIRWAY ALGORITHM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a difficult airway is identified using the LEMON criteria, the difficult airway algorithm is used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58510\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef58510 \">algorithm 4</a>). Predictors of airway difficulty when using a video laryngoscope remain to be fully defined; pending that, it is reasonable to apply the same principles of airway assessment and decision making, regardless of whether a traditional direct or a video laryngoscope will be used. Although the difficult airway algorithm appears complex, it is really a series of simple questions: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there sufficient time? If not, this is a failed airway, and the failed airway algorithm should be used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73112\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73112 \">algorithm 5</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is rapid sequence intubation (RSI) a reasonable approach, even though the airway has been identified as difficult?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If RSI is not reasonable, what can be learned from an awake look at the glottis?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there still sufficient time? If so, a number of alternatives remain. If not, the situation represents a failed airway.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Applying the algorithm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before initiating the steps in the difficult airway algorithm, the first action is to obtain any necessary assistance (personnel, equipment, airway devices) at the earliest opportunity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58510\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef58510 \">algorithm 4</a>). As this is being done, the stepwise management of the difficult airway can proceed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4311600\"><span class=\"h3\">Is the operator forced to act?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the face of rapid deterioration mandating prompt airway intervention, with a patient who is unable to cooperate or rapidly progressing airway swelling, immediate administration of an induction agent and neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) may be indicated, even though the airway is identified to be difficult. In such a situation, patient conditions <strong>force the operator to act immediately</strong> to forestall deterioration to respiratory arrest or complete airway obstruction. An example of such a patient is a morbidly obese patient with severe status asthmaticus, who is combative and fatigued, with oxygen saturations falling into the 80s, despite maximal therapy, including high flow oxygen (if the latter can be kept in place). In such circumstances, a prompt decision to give RSI drugs and create the best possible situation for a <em>single best attempt </em>at tracheal intubation, whether by laryngoscopy or surgical airway, often is preferable to considering other (likely impossible) approaches as the patient progresses toward respiratory arrest and death. If this single best attempt is not successful, a failed airway is present, and the operator proceeds to the failed airway algorithm. </p><p>An alternative approach, termed by its advocates &ldquo;delayed sequence intubation&rdquo; (DSI), has been advocated for use in the &ldquo;forced to act&rdquo; category of patients who are agitated or uncooperative as described above. Advocates of DSI recommend administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> sufficient to gain control of the patient to permit pre-oxygenation, followed by administration of an intubating dose of a NMBA. Although DSI has been recommended on podcasts and in educational presentations, formal assessment of the technique is limited to small case series and case reports. At present, we do not feel there is sufficient evidence to support the use of DSI, nor is there any evidence regarding its relative safety in any patient population when compared to RSI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Is there time?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the operator is not forced to act, the next determination is whether the patient's oxygenation is adequate. Adequate oxygenation is defined as the ability to maintain the patient's oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2), as measured by a pulse oximeter, at 90 percent or higher. A patient with chronically low, but stable, oxygenation might be considered to have adequate oxygenation at a lower threshold value, but the risk of rapid desaturation is much higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Adequate SpO2 allows the clinician time to plan and implement a stepwise approach to airway management.</p><p>If oxygenation is inadequate, attempts are made to improve it with supplemental oxygen, or bag-mask ventilation (or assisted ventilation). If there is insufficient time to plan a methodical approach to the airway because adequate SpO2 cannot be maintained, the airway is considered to be a failed airway (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73112\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73112 \">algorithm 5</a>). The combination of an anticipated difficult intubation and inability to maintain SpO2 at adequate levels is a surrogate for the &quot;can't intubate, can't ventilate&quot; failed airway. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-failed-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the failed airway in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Is RSI reasonable?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many difficult airways are managed using rapid sequence intubation (RSI). The presence of a difficult airway does not preclude use of RSI, but requires the operator to ask two key questions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Am I confident I could oxygenate the patient using a bag and mask or an extraglottic device? &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Am I confident I can intubate?</p><p/><p>RSI is not a prudent option if the operator is not confident the patient can be ventilated adequately with a bag and mask or an extraglottic device, in which case an awake technique is advised. Even if bag-mask ventilation is deemed possible, RSI is not advisable unless the clinician believes oral intubation will likely be successful. RSI can be performed (using the universal emergency airway algorithm) if the clinician answers yes to both key questions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76711\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef76711 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63518\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef63518 \">algorithm 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation for adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Often, a double set-up is used when RSI is planned in the setting of a potentially difficult airway. Double set-up means the alternative (ie, back-up) airway device and approach (often a surgical airway) are identified and readied, before beginning the intubation sequence. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Awake technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>&ldquo;Awake&rdquo; is an imprecise term that connotes direct examination of the upper airway, facilitated by light to moderate sedation and topical anesthesia, using a direct laryngoscope, flexible endoscope, or rigid fiberoptic or video laryngoscope. The term is imprecise, because it refers to a number of different approaches, having only in common that each is done while the patient is breathing on their own and, although technically awake, is sedated as for a painful procedure to permit laryngoscopy.</p><p>The patient receives procedural sedation and topical anesthesia (depending upon their clinical condition) to permit laryngoscopy, and intubation if indicated. The laryngoscopy may identify barriers that preclude oral intubation, and mandate cricothyrotomy, or, conversely, may identify a straightforward upper airway amenable to RSI. The patient may simply be inspected, then a decision made to proceed with an intubation plan, or may be intubated during the awake look, depending upon the circumstances, likelihood of deterioration, and the judgment of the operator.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Alternatives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the awake examination identifies that RSI is not advisable, and the patient cannot be intubated during laryngoscopy (eg, glottis cannot be visualized during awake look), a number of airway management options remain, provided an adequate SpO2 is maintained. The goal with the difficult airway, as with any emergency intubation, is to place a cuffed endotracheal tube in the trachea. A number of devices can be used to accomplish this end.</p><p>An intubating laryngeal mask airway may be placed, then an endotracheal tube passed through it. A fiberoptic or video device, such as a flexible bronchoscope or a rigid fiberoptic intubating stylet, may be used. A video laryngoscope likely will achieve a glottic view superior to that of a standard laryngoscope, enabling intubation. A fiberoptic or video intubating stylet may be used. Primary cricothyrotomy (ie, cricothyrotomy as a planned airway intervention, rather than a rescue) may be indicated if oral access or the supraglottic region of the airway is anatomically disrupted. Blind nasotracheal intubation may rarely have a role, but is best reserved for situations in which no other device is available or felt to be appropriate (eg, massive hemorrhage obscuring vision).

The key determinations are whether the operator is &ldquo;forced to act&rdquo; and, if not, whether the patient's oxygenation is adequate (ie, SpO2 &gt;90 percent). The forced to act situation supports administration of RSI drugs, even if intubation is anticipated to be difficult. If the operator is not forced to act, but oxygenation is inadequate, attempts are made to improve it with supplemental oxygen or bag-mask ventilation. If adequate SpO2 cannot be maintained, the airway is considered to be a failed airway and is managed accordingly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73112\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73112 \">algorithm 5</a>).
