Most of these issues are common to pregnancies worldwide. Preconception care and ongoing prenatal care after the initial prenatal visit are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-preconception-office-visit\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The preconception office visit&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-care-second-and-third-trimesters\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal care: Second and third trimesters&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3664721341\"><span class=\"h1\">GOALS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major goal of prenatal care is to help ensure the birth of a healthy baby while minimizing risk to the mother. There are several components involved in achieving this objective:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early, accurate estimation of gestational age</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identification of pregnancies at increased risk for maternal or fetal morbidity and mortality</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ongoing evaluation of maternal and fetal health status </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anticipation of problems with intervention, if possible, to prevent or minimize morbidity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Health promotion, education, support, and shared decision-making </p><p/><p>Healthy women have described the following factors as those that matter most to them for a positive pregnancy experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-initial-assessment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintaining physical and sociocultural normality</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintaining a healthy pregnancy (preventing and treating risks, illness, and death)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having an effective transition to positive labor and birth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Achieving positive motherhood (maternal self-esteem, competence, and autonomy)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63919208\"><span class=\"h1\">TIMING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prenatal care should be initiated in the first trimester, ideally by 10 weeks of gestation since some prenatal screening and diagnostic tests can be performed at this gestational age. Early initiation of care is also useful to establish early baseline measurements (eg, weight, blood pressure, laboratory evaluation in women with chronic diseases) and provide early social service support and intervention, when warranted.</p><p>The percentage of pregnant women who initiate prenatal care in the first trimester is one of the standard clinical performance measures used to assess the quality of maternal health care. In the past decade, approximately 75 percent of pregnant women in the United States obtained prenatal care in the first trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-initial-assessment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The World Health Organization estimated that 60 percent of women worldwide initiated prenatal care before 12 weeks of gestation; however, regional and income disparities were identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-initial-assessment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Less than 50 percent of women in developing regions received early antenatal care versus over 80 percent in developed regions, and more than 4 of 5 women in the highest income group received early antenatal care versus 1 of 4 women in the lowest income group.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CARE PROVIDER</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3409718268\"><span class=\"h2\">Standard one-on-one care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prenatal care is generally provided by midwives, obstetrician-gynecologists, family medicine clinicians, and maternal-fetal medicine (MFM) subspecialists. Midwives and family medicine clinicians generally provide prenatal care for women with pregnancies where major complications are not anticipated. Obstetrician-gynecologists are specialists who provide prenatal care for uncomplicated and some complicated pregnancies. MFM clinicians are subspecialist obstetrician-gynecologists with expertise for managing high-risk, complicated pregnancies. (See <a href=\"#H1529838024\" class=\"local\">'Subspecialty obstetrical care'</a> below.)</p><p>Midwifery-led care and collaboration between midwives and physicians are common models of prenatal care, influenced by the <span class=\"nowrap\">medical/obstetric</span> needs and personal preferences of the pregnant woman as well as local licensing regulations. In a systematic review of trials in which pregnant women were randomly assigned to midwife-led continuity models of care or other models of care (15 trials, over 17,000 women), women in midwife-led continuity models of care were less likely to experience intrapartum intervention, more likely to be satisfied with their care, and had similar rates of adverse outcomes as women who received other models of care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-initial-assessment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Another systematic review that compared&nbsp;midwife-led models of&nbsp;care&nbsp;with other models of&nbsp;care reported similar findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-initial-assessment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The trials included women at low risk of complications and women at increased risk, but not currently experiencing problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2994287640\"><span class=\"h2\">Group prenatal care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Group prenatal care is an alternative means of providing prenatal care in which participants with the same month of expected delivery receive the majority of their care in a group setting. The only private time between patient and clinician is during the initial prenatal assessment, when health concerns involving need for privacy arise, and during cervical assessment late in pregnancy. The majority of the visit, which may last two hours, involves facilitated group discussion, education, and skills building to address explicit learning objectives in prenatal care, childbirth preparation, and postpartum and parenting roles. Group prenatal care appears to result in at least equivalent obstetric outcomes and high levels of patient satisfaction compared with traditional prenatal care. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=group-prenatal-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Group prenatal care&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1529838024\"><span class=\"h2\">Subspecialty obstetrical care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MFM subspecialists are obstetrician-gynecologists with additional training in the area of high-risk, complicated pregnancies. Referral to a MFM subspecialist is appropriate for women with chronic health conditions, women who have experienced pregnancy complications in the past, and women who develop complications during their current pregnancy; however, this decision depends on the obstetrician-gynecologist's level of expertise with the specific problem.</p><p>Subspecialist care for high-risk pregnancies has not been studied extensively, except for specialty clinics that provide a prenatal care package for women at high risk of preterm birth. A 2017 systematic review that analyzed randomized trials of this issue found no significant difference in preterm birth, very preterm birth, or stillbirth between the group that received care at a clinic to prevent the onset of preterm labor and facilitate its early identification and treatment and the usual care group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-initial-assessment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. There were many limitations to these data, including heterogeneity in outcome focus, target populations, study design, and specific intervention components.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2329776987\"><span class=\"h2\">Multidisciplinary care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with medical comorbidities benefit from collaborative multidisciplinary care by a team that includes their obstetric provider and appropriate medical or surgical subspecialists, and possibly specialists in genetics, anesthesia, and pediatrics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2820984859\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPONENTS OF THE INITIAL PRENATAL VISIT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Appropriate history, physical examination, and laboratory studies can help identify pregnant women at increased risk of medical complications, pregnancy complications, or fetal abnormalities. Early identification of these women gives the provider an opportunity to discuss these issues and their management with the patient and, in some cases, offer interventions to prevent or minimize the risk of an adverse outcome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3185082257\"><span class=\"h3\">Medical/obstetrical history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At or prior to the first prenatal visit, it is efficient for the patient to complete a questionnaire detailing her psychosocial, medical, obstetrical, and family history. This information can be used to start an obstetrical record that will document her prenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum course. Several paper and computerized obstetrical record forms are available for this purpose (eg, <a href=\"https://www.gsa.gov/portal/forms/download/115526&amp;token=JQnhSnq2A20YrM7/K7tG+6d1c7RaYUrDUA9DNYXYKSogNmmtVbL2yPbPiYAa4cvM1SDS+x2qJXZSgT3ZI7G6cQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=446\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Federal Government Prenatal Record</a> form SF533). They help to ensure complete and systematic documentation of the pregnancy and often may be used for risk-assessment planning.</p><p>The major elements of the patient history include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Personal and demographic information</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Past obstetrical history</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Personal and family medical history (sites for obtaining tools for the family history are available in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62528\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62528 \">table 1</a>)), including risk assessment for heritable disorders and substance use</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Past surgical history</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Menstrual and gynecological history</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Current pregnancy history</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Travel to areas endemic for malaria, tuberculosis, Zika virus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychosocial information</p><p/><p>If the patient has risk factors for ectopic pregnancy (eg, history of ectopic pregnancy or pelvic infection), early identification of the location of the pregnancy is important. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ectopic-pregnancy-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-anatomic-sites#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ectopic pregnancy: Epidemiology, risk factors, and anatomic sites&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ectopic-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H116040104\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ectopic pregnancy: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Use of validated screening tool for substance use is recommended.

In a meta-analysis, a previous preterm or small-for-gestational-age birth was associated with an increased risk of stillbirth in a subsequent pregnancy, and the smaller and more preterm the previous infant, the higher the risk of stillbirth in the subsequent pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-initial-assessment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In addition, mothers who had a previous stillbirth were more likely to have preterm or small for gestational age infants in the subsequent pregnancy. Most of the studies were retrospective and did not adequately describe the cause of preterm birth, stillbirth, or small for gestational age, which limits the clinical utility of the findings. &#160; </p><p>Although rare, patients should be queried about a history of phenylketonuria, which is detected on newborn screening. If the patient does not volunteer the diagnosis because she is no longer on a restricted diet, asking her about dietary restrictions during childhood might reveal the diagnosis. Elevated serum phenylalanine concentration during early pregnancy in a mother with phenylketonuria or hyperphenylalaninemia can result in phenylalanine embryopathy, which can be prevented by dietary restriction of phenylalanine intake. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-phenylketonuria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of phenylketonuria&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H168218816\"><span class=\"h3\">Psychosocial history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psychosocial issues of potential concern that should be identified and discussed with the patient include whether the pregnancy was planned or unintended, potential barriers to care (eg, communication, transportation, child care issues, economic constraints, work schedule), whether the patient has stable housing, and her mental health and level of stress (including depression screening) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-initial-assessment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This is an opportunity to provide information and, if indicated, make suggestions for possible changes or referral.

The clinician should be aware of markers and characteristics of abuse, such as bruising, improbable injury, depression, late prenatal care (presentation in the late second or the third trimester), missed prenatal visits, and appointments cancelled on short notice. Exposure to intimate partner violence is associated with an increased risk of low birth weight newborns and preterm birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-initial-assessment/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Counseling and intervention can reduce intimate partner violence and improve pregnancy outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-initial-assessment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Accurate dating is crucial for managing the pregnancy, especially with regard to timing interventions and monitoring fetal growth. Sonographic estimation of the EDD before 20 weeks of gestation is desirable in all pregnancies. (See <a href=\"#H4015627017\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasound examination'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Baseline blood pressure, weight, and height should be recorded as part of the examination. Calculating body mass index (BMI) facilitates counseling about the appropriate amount of weight gain over the course of pregnancy. Underweight and obese women are counseled about their specific risks in pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=weight-gain-and-loss-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Weight gain and loss in pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-pregnancy-complications-and-maternal-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in pregnancy: Complications and maternal management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If the baseline blood pressure is elevated (systolic 120 to 129 mmHg and diastolic &lt;80 mmHg) or hypertensive (systolic &ge;130 mmHg or diastolic &ge;80 mmHg), the clinician should attempt to find records of prepregnancy blood pressures to document whether the patient has chronic (pre-existing) hypertension (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hypertension-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Definitions'</a>). This information can be important in establishing the correct diagnosis (pre-existing hypertension versus preeclampsia) if blood pressure increases in the second half of pregnancy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H2297175740\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Preexisting hypertension versus preeclampsia'</a>). If blood pressure is measured using an automated device, it should have been properly validated in a pregnant population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-initial-assessment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Management of pre-existing hypertension in pregnancy is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hypertension-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hypertension in pregnant and postpartum women&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A complete physical examination should be performed, with special attention to uterine size and shape and evaluation of the adnexa. As discussed above, when the uterine size on physical examination differs from that predicted by menstrual dating, sonographic assessment is indicated. Causes for a discrepancy between the actual uterine size and that predicted by the last menstrual period include uterine fibroids, uterine malposition (eg, retroverted uterus), multiple gestation, and incorrect menstrual date. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-assessment-of-gestational-age-date-of-delivery-and-fetal-weight\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal assessment of gestational age, date of delivery, and fetal weight&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When fetal cardiac activity is present, the fetal heart can usually be heard by 12 weeks of gestation using a hand-held Doppler ultrasound device. Transvaginal ultrasound scanners can identify fetal cardiac motion as early as 5.5 weeks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4015627017\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasound examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine early (before 20 weeks of gestation) ultrasound examination is beneficial because of better estimation of gestational age than menstrual dates, resulting in significantly reduced frequency of labor induction for post-term pregnancy and use of tocolysis for suspected preterm labor. Ultrasound examination in the first trimester, if possible, is particularly important when menses are irregular, the last menstrual period is unknown or uncertain, in patients who conceive while taking oral contraceptive pills, and when the uterine size is discordant with menstrual dates. These data are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-assessment-of-gestational-age-date-of-delivery-and-fetal-weight\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal assessment of gestational age, date of delivery, and fetal weight&quot;</a>.)</p><p>First-trimester ultrasound examination can lead to earlier detection of clinically unsuspected fetal malformations (including aneuploidies) and earlier detection of multiple pregnancy. This information has not been proven to improve overall fetal outcome, although studies have lacked power to assess for secondary outcomes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=routine-prenatal-ultrasonography-as-a-screening-tool\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Routine prenatal ultrasonography as a screening tool&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3149692451\"><span class=\"h2\">Discussion of screening and testing for genetic abnormalities in offspring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients undergoing any screening test should understand the difference between a screening test and diagnostic test. This is particularly important in genetic screening, where couples need to understand what is and is not being screened for, the interpretation of screen positive and negative results, the possibility of false positive and negative results, possible follow-up invasive or noninvasive testing, and possible reproductive choices.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H943109238\"><span class=\"h2\">Aneuploidy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ACOG recommends that (1) all women should be offered aneuploidy screening before 20 weeks of gestation and (2) all women should have the option of having a diagnostic invasive procedure (genetic studies on samples obtained by chorionic villus biopsy or amniocentesis) instead of screening, regardless of maternal age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-initial-assessment/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>Multiple screening tests are available and fall into two major categories:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment of maternal serum levels of specific biochemical markers associated with Down syndrome (trisomy 21) and trisomy 18, with or without assessment of specific ultrasound markers, is one option (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71552\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71552 \">table 3</a>). This approach may lead to detection of fetal conditions beyond the primary targets (trisomies 21 and 18) (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=down-syndrome-overview-of-prenatal-screening\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Down syndrome: Overview of prenatal screening&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment of cell-free DNA in the maternal circulation to screen for trisomy 21, trisomy 18, trisomy 13, and sex chromosome aneuploidies is the other option.

Each obstetrician-gynecologist or other health care provider or practice should establish a standard approach that is consistently offered to and discussed with each patient, ideally before pregnancy.

Screening tests fall into two categories: (1) assessment of maternal serum levels of specific biochemical markers associated with Down syndrome, with or without assessment of specific ultrasound markers and (2) assessment of cell-free DNA in the maternal circulation. Either approach is acceptable as long as the patient receives appropriate pretest genetic counseling to make an informed choice. The cost to the patient can differ substantially depending on the approach and is another factor for the patient to consider.
