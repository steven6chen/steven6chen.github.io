With aging, however, many men can experience important changes in bodily function that are linked to declines in testosterone production. As men age, there are gradual declines in sexual function that have variable impacts on sexual activity. Sexual desire remains relatively stable in most men. Erections are less reliable and durable, and require more stimulation to achieve and sustain. Ejaculation during orgasm involves decreased amounts of seminal fluid, and the refractory period between orgasms can increase by hours to days. With age, the total testosterone level in men drops by an average of 1.6 percent per year. Levels below 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L</span> are typically associated with symptoms including loss of libido, erectile dysfunction, loss of bone and muscle mass, loss of strength, fatigue, and even poor concentration and depression. Levels between 8 and 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L</span> are often symptomatic, but symptoms that occur with levels above 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L</span> are more likely due to other causes. By age 60, 20 percent of men have low testosterone levels, and this rises to 50 percent of men over age 80.

There is a general decline in the frequency of sexual activity in both sexes after the age of 65, but not as much as might be expected. Fifty to 80 percent of men and women over 60 surveyed continue to be sexually active, usually defined as having sexual intercourse at least once a month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-older-adults/abstract/11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-15</a>].

Older couples may have greater privacy and more time for intimacy. Individuals who understand that certain changes in sexual function are normal are less fearful and better able to adapt. As an example, instead of dreading the effects of menopause, a woman may welcome the freedom from worry about contraception and unwanted pregnancy. Instead of focusing solely on sexual intercourse as the end-all and be-all of sexuality, a man may be able to shift his focus to the pleasurable sensual intimacy of sexual foreplay.

If the clinician is embarrassed or uncomfortable asking questions about sexual function, it is unlikely that adequate assessment will occur. The clinician must be able to ask direct questions using common language, and to listen carefully and patiently, keeping in mind that older people will have many of the same sexual concerns as younger people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-older-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. An indispensable source of information about a sexual problem is the partner. The partner&rsquo;s presence during an interview will help facilitate open communication with the affected partner. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sexual dysfunction in women: Epidemiology, risk factors, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=female-orgasmic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis#H7344421\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Female orgasmic disorder: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Assessment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-male-sexual-dysfunction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of male sexual dysfunction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-woman-with-sexual-pain#H1178544832\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the woman with sexual pain&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>One way to organize the assessment process and increase the comfort level of both the clinician and patient is to use a formal interview, also termed a sexual status examination. The goal of the sexual status examination is to identify the presence and degree of problematic changes in sexual function across the stages of the sexual response cycle. Inherent to this exam is a sex history that inquires about an individual&rsquo;s current sexual functioning, prior sexual experiences, attitudes towards sexuality, and the state of any current relationship. </p><p>Clinicians can increase their own comfort level with discussing these topics with patients by role-playing an interview alone or with a colleague, with a focus on using sexual terms in a comfortable and matter-of-fact way. Patients are often more relaxed during an interview when they see that the clinician is skilled and comfortable with the questions. Couching sexual issues in medical terms can be a way of facilitating the interview, as the assessment process should include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A complete medical and psychiatric history</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A mental status examination to identify symptoms of anxiety or depression that may be blocking desire and performance, or thoughts (eg, angry, obsessive, psychotic) that are interfering with sexual arousal</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A physical examination with a focus on urologic or gynecologic function done by a specialist</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Select laboratory studies, including testosterone and prolactin levels if a metabolic or hormonal etiology is suspected</p><p/><p>In addition, it is critical to ask about the quality of an individual&rsquo;s current relationships, since marital or couples&rsquo; stress are important factors associated with sexual dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-older-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13732797\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At the outset of treatment for sexual dysfunction in late life it is important for the clinician to provide reassurance and education. Reassurance of the patient depends on an enlightened clinician who understands that sexuality in general and sexual intercourse in particular remain important goals for many older patients. The clinician should listen empathically, and then emphasize in clear and nontechnical language the normality of sexuality in late life and the possibility of effective treatment for sexual problems. Keep in mind that many patients have internalized negative perspectives on late-life sexuality. The act of providing reassurance builds trust between patient and clinician, and this relationship will lay the basis for the patient feeling comfortable with being open about emotional reactions to the problem, and seeking follow-up treatment. Many treatments fail at this point; not because the treatment will not work, but because the patient and clinician never establish a solid working relationship, or because the patient is overcome with pessimism or doubt and refuses to engage in treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H627132559\"><span class=\"h2\">Education</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Educating patients about both normal and pathologic changes in sexual function in late life can reduce excessive fear and increase acceptance of these changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-older-adults/abstract/46,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,48</a>]. As examples, in each of the following cases, the patient can be reassured that his or her sexual changes may have an identifiable, possibly treatable cause:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A man may misinterpret normal decline in erectile function as a sexual problem. A woman may misinterpret her experience of vaginal dryness to mean that she does not want to have sex. Such overreactions to normal changes can affect sexuality even more than the underlying physical changes, leading some individuals to engage in less frequent or more limited sexual activity. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An older man with diabetes or atherosclerotic disease may have a more pronounced decline in erectile function or even erectile dysfunction, given possible compromise of penile blood flow. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An older woman with a history of an arthritic hip might experience limited pelvic movement or even pain during sex, in addition to potential discomfort due to decreased vaginal lubrication. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A depressed patient may report significant reductions in libido. </p><p/><p>The clinician should review with the patient possible causes, the nature and likelihood of benefits and risks of treatment, and where appropriate discuss ways in which the patient&rsquo;s physical or mental state may be influencing these changes.</p><p>Education should focus on improving the quality of an individual&rsquo;s sexual relationship with his or her partner. Sometimes the clinician can provide a forum for the couple to discuss basic difficulties during sexual activity, and strategize on ways to improve them. The clinician should emphasize to the couple that sex can be more than just intercourse, and that physically pleasing each other can occur through massage and masturbation, and does not always have to be mutual. Couples often have to adapt sexual techniques and refocus more time on foreplay in order to preserve previous levels of sexual function and enjoyment.</p><p>Education about sexuality, sexually transmitted diseases, and safe sex practices should not be neglected in clinical care for older adults. Many are sexually active, but may be at risk due to knowledge deficits. Many older adults completed their schooling prior to the introduction of routine sexual education.

In general, however, there are a number of important considerations for the older couple: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If one or both partners suffer from chronic medical illness or disability, sexual practices may need to be adapted to account for physical limitations, fatigue, loss of muscle strength, and pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-older-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. As an example, a clinician who treats the condition in question should be consulted on ways to minimize pain or discomfort and maximize function, perhaps by taking analgesics or other treatments (eg, specific muscle stretches, nasal oxygen, inhalers) prior to sex. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sexual positions with the couple lying side-by-side, or rear entry braced by pillows, might minimize physical exertion or stress on certain parts of the body. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Over-the-counter lubricants should be used liberally to counteract potential discomfort from dry or atrophied genital tissue.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is important to allowing extra time for foreplay since with age it might take longer to provide sufficient arousal to achieve orgasm. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2818984677\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific interventions</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3904751\"><span class=\"h3\">Psychotherapy for sexual dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sex therapy is a psychotherapeutic process that utilizes supportive, insight-oriented, and cognitive-behavioral techniques to treat sexual dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-older-adults/abstract/2,51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,51,52</a>]. </p><p>The basic approach for an older individual or couple will not differ substantively from younger individuals, with a few caveats. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older couples may have more longstanding relationship discord which must be addressed before sex therapy can begin. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age-related changes in physical or mental health, such as the presence of cognitive impairment in one partner, will require specific discussions about their impact on the sexual relationship. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sensate focus exercises, designed to couple sensuous physical intimacy with relaxation, will have to be adapted for any physical limitations in one or both partners. </p><p/><p>When encountering significant resistance to treatment, remain hopeful. It is quite common for the older couple in sex therapy to rediscover that they retain a considerable amount of sexual energy and ability, and this can lead to a newfound appreciation for their relationship and the life-affirming role of sexual intimacy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1260681743\"><span class=\"h3\">Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phosphodiesterase (PDE) 5 inhibitors are used in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Clinical trials have shown them to be efficacious in older men, although with less responsiveness compared to younger men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-older-adults/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. For some older men without optimal response to on-demand use, daily low-dose administration may be more effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-older-adults/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Side effects seen in older men include headache, skin flushing, dizziness, gastrointestinal discomfort, back pain and blurred vision. The combination of PDE and nitrates (eg, sublingual <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a>, isosorbide) can lead to hypotension and should be avoided in older men with a history of angina. PDE 5 inhibitors should be used with caution in men with abnormal penile shape, a history of orthostatic hypotension, severe renal or hepatic disease, concomitant use of certain antiviral and antifungal medications, and diseases that increase the risk of priapism, such as multiple myeloma and leukemia. </p><p>Any changes in visual acuity while taking a PDE 5 inhibitor require immediate assessment. Case reports have described the rare occurrence with PDE 5 inhibitors of nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NOIAN), characterized by the rapid onset of visual loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-older-adults/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. </p><p>The benefits, risks, and contraindications of phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors in erectile dysfunction in the general adult population are discussed separately.

Accompanying changes in sexual function include declines in libido, sexual responsiveness, comfort level, and sexual frequency. Declines in testosterone production in premenopausal women may also lead to loss of libido, reduced tactile sensitivity, and fatigue. (See <a href=\"#H1260681611\" class=\"local\">'Women'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of menopause&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With aging, many men experience declines in testosterone production along with associated reductions in sexual desire, erection, and frequency of ejaculation.
