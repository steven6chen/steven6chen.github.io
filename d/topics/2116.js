An ideal blood biomarker for stroke would be reliable, rapidly measured, and readily available, and might assist with diagnosis, determination of stroke subtype or mechanism, or prediction of outcome or response to therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F96470\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96470 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-biomarkers-for-stroke/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The development of diagnostic blood biomarkers for stroke, which might help distinguish stroke from mimics, faces tremendous challenges given the heterogeneity of stroke, the presence of the blood-brain-barrier, and the complexity of brain injury. To date, individual markers have lacked sufficient sensitivity and specificity for stroke diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-biomarkers-for-stroke/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Panels of biomarkers may hold greater promise and are under active study, though they too have yet to demonstrate sufficient accuracy to be of clinical use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-biomarkers-for-stroke/abstract/4-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-10</a>].</p><p>In addition to diagnosis, biomarkers might assist with identification of stroke mechanism, such as markers of cardioembolism (see <a href=\"#H30411402\" class=\"local\">'Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)'</a> below), carotid atherosclerosis (see <a href=\"#H30408572\" class=\"local\">'C-reactive protein (CRP)'</a> below), cancer hypercoagulability (see <a href=\"#H30408596\" class=\"local\">'D-dimer'</a> below), and large artery atherosclerosis (see <a href=\"#H30408644\" class=\"local\">'Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2)'</a> below). Once validated, such biomarkers could be useful for choosing specific primary and secondary prevention strategies.</p><p>Numerous biomarkers are associated with stroke outcome, including the risk of first or recurrent stroke, though how to incorporate these markers into clinically meaningful prognostic tools remains controversial. Markers may also predict risk of early complications in stroke patients, allowing closer monitoring and earlier intervention. However, it remains uncertain how much additive value is provided beyond traditional risk assessment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30411402\"><span class=\"h1\">BRAIN NATRIURETIC PEPTIDE (BNP)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), also called B-type natriuretic peptide, is a neurohormone initially identified in the brain but released primarily from the heart. BNP is secreted from the cardiac ventricles in response to increased wall tension (myocyte stretch) or volume overload. Physiologically, BNP has diuretic, natriuretic, and hypotensive effects (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-heart-failure#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Natriuretic peptide measurement in heart failure&quot;, section on 'Physiologic role in HF'</a>). It increases urinary excretion of sodium, leading to expanded volume of urine, relaxes vascular smooth muscle, and inhibits both the sympathetic and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems. BNP is synthesized as a prohormone (proBNP), which is cleaved after release in the circulation into the biologically active C-terminal fragment and the inactive N-terminal (NT-proBNP) fragment. The half-life and stability of NT-proBNP is several times that of BNP, leading to generally higher concentrations of NT-proBNP.</p><p>As discussed below, measurement of BNP in the setting of cryptogenic stroke is helpful to assess the likelihood of a cardioembolic source, including the presence of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, although optimal cutoff values for individual assays are undefined. Substantially elevated BNP levels suggest the need for intensive cardiac evaluation, including echocardiography and prolonged cardiac rhythm monitoring. (See <a href=\"#H30408554\" class=\"local\">'BNP and cardioembolic stroke'</a> below.)</p><p>Plasma BNP or NT-proBNP is useful as a component of the evaluation of suspected heart failure when the diagnosis is uncertain. Details of BNP use in the cardiac setting are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Natriuretic peptide measurement in heart failure&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-suspected-heart-failure#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with suspected heart failure&quot;, section on 'BNP and NT-proBNP'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30408554\"><span class=\"h2\">BNP and cardioembolic stroke</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The results of observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-biomarkers-for-stroke/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>] and a systematic review and meta-analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-biomarkers-for-stroke/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] suggest that measurement of BNP levels is useful in identifying patients with stroke due to a cardioembolic source. Elevated plasma BNP levels are associated both with heart failure and with atrial fibrillation (AF), two important cardioembolic stroke mechanisms with specific management implications. Measurement of BNP may thus help focus the stroke evaluation on the most likely etiologic mechanism. Identification of paroxysmal AF is a particular challenge, as detection rates of AF vary significantly based upon the monitoring strategy used. Paroxysmal AF, if transient, infrequent, and largely asymptomatic, may be undetected on standard cardiac monitoring such as continuous telemetry and 24- or 48-hour Holter monitors. More prolonged cardiac event monitoring (eg, for several weeks) can significantly increase the detection of AF in patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) or acute ischemic stroke (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-evaluation-of-stroke#H24817210\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the evaluation of stroke&quot;, section on 'Monitoring for occult atrial fibrillation'</a>). Measurement of BNP can be a useful adjunct to determining which patients are most likely to harbor occult AF.</p><p>The association of elevated plasma BNP with cardioembolic stroke is supported by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study that evaluated 707 patients with acute ischemic stroke or TIA, a plasma BNP &gt;76 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> was an independent predictor of a cardioembolic mechanism (odds ratio 2.3, 95% CI 1.4-3.7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-biomarkers-for-stroke/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The sensitivity and specificity of BNP &gt;76 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> for identification of a cardioembolic mechanism were 72 and 68 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a report of 221 patients with acute ischemic stroke, there were 81 patients with a high plasma BNP (&gt;140 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL)</span>. Of these, a cardioembolic mechanism was diagnosed in 73 percent. In contrast, of 140 patients with a low BNP (&le;140 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL),</span> a cardioembolic mechanism was found in only 12 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-biomarkers-for-stroke/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The sensitivity and specificity of BNP <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;140pg/mL</span> for a cardioembolic mechanism were 78 and 85 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 125 consecutive patients with ischemic stroke, the most frequent subtype was cardioembolic (46 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-biomarkers-for-stroke/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. For differentiating a cardioembolic subtype, a NT-proBNP level &ge;342 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> had a sensitivity and specificity of 93 and 75 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a Japanese study of 237 patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, plasma BNP levels measured on admission were significantly higher in patients with atrial fibrillation compared with those in sinus rhythm (402 versus 92 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL,</span> respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-biomarkers-for-stroke/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. For the identification of subsequent atrial fibrillation among those initially in sinus rhythm, a plasma BNP level &ge;85 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> yielded a sensitivity and specificity of 83 and 76 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 264 patients with acute ischemic stroke (55 with atrial fibrillation), plasma NT-proBNP levels &gt;265.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mg</span> had a sensitivity and specificity of 100 percent and 71 percent, respectively, for identification of AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-biomarkers-for-stroke/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In the subgroup of 80 patients with cryptogenic stroke, paroxysmal AF on follow-up was identified in 17. For the identification of subsequent AF in this group, a baseline plasma NT-proBNP level &gt;265.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mg</span> had a sensitivity and specificity of 88 percent and 62 percent, respectively. Using a higher threshold of 912 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL,</span> the specificity improved in both groups to near 90 percent, though sensitivity was substantially reduced. </p><p/><p>Further evidence supporting BNP as a predictor of cardioembolic stroke comes from a post-hoc analysis of WARSS, a randomized trial that compared <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> in the prevention of recurrent ischemic stroke in patients with presumed noncardioembolic stroke. Among a cohort of 1028 patients in WARSS for whom blood samples were available, those with plasma NT-proBNP concentrations in the top 5 percent (&gt;750 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL)</span> had a significant reduction in the composite end point of stroke or death favoring warfarin (hazard ratio 0.30, 95% CI 0.12-0.84) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-biomarkers-for-stroke/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In contrast, no benefit of warfarin over aspirin was seen in those with NT-proBNP levels &le;750 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span>. These findings suggest that elevated NT-proBNP concentrations identified a subgroup of patients with an occult cardioembolic stroke mechanism (eg, from atrial fibrillation or heart failure) who benefited from anticoagulation. However, WARSS was performed prior to widespread use of prolonged cardiac monitoring for acute stroke, and occult atrial fibrillation may have been underdiagnosed. </p><p>Taken in its entirety, the data support a role for BNP as a predictor of cardioembolic stroke, particularly cardioembolism due to heart failure and atrial fibrillation. While various threshold levels have been identified in different studies, comparison across studies is difficult due to the use of different assays and variable measurement of BNP versus NT-proBNP. Nevertheless, it appears that the likelihood of cardioembolism rises linearly with BNP such that markedly elevated levels in the setting of cryptogenic stroke should raise suspicion for a cardioembolic source, with more aggressive diagnostic pursuit of heart failure and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30408560\"><span class=\"h2\">BNP and stroke risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elevated BNP levels have been associated with an increased risk of incident stroke, as suggested by the following reports: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 3346 subjects without heart failure in the Framingham Heart Study, those in the highest tertile of NT-proBNP levels had a nearly fivefold increase in the risk of transient ischemic attack or stroke compared with those in the lowest tertile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-biomarkers-for-stroke/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a subset of 1502 subjects in the population-based REGARDS study who had baseline NT-proBNP levels measured, those in the highest quartile of NT-proBNP levels had a nearly threefold increased risk of first stroke compared with those in the bottom quartile, even after adjusting for traditional vascular risk factors. Elevated BNP was particularly associated with cardioembolic stroke, with a ninefold greater risk for those in the top compared with the bottom quartile of NT-proBNP levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-biomarkers-for-stroke/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a Danish prospective population study of 537 patients without cardiovascular disease at baseline, those in the top quintile of NT-proBNP levels compared with those in lower quintiles had a more than threefold greater risk of stroke or transient ischemic attack after adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors, left ventricular dysfunction, and renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-biomarkers-for-stroke/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two other population-based studies also found an association between elevated BNP levels and risk of ischemic stroke, but only in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-biomarkers-for-stroke/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p/><p>Elevated NT-proBNP levels appear to predict stroke risk even in patients with known atrial fibrillation treated with anticoagulation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 6189 patients with available blood samples in the RE-LY trial, which randomized patients with atrial fibrillation to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabigatran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dabigatran</a>, subjects with plasma NT-proBNP levels in the highest quartile (&gt;1402 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/L)</span> had an annual stroke risk of 2 percent, while those in the lowest quartile (&lt;387 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/L)</span> had an annual stroke risk of 0.8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-biomarkers-for-stroke/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Addition of NT-proBNP to the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score significantly improved prediction of embolic events.</p><p/><p>While these data establish an increased risk of stroke associated with elevated BNP levels, it remains unclear how measurement of BNP might be incorporated into clinical practice, given that identified cut-off levels vary widely across studies. In addition, strategies for modifying treatment based on BNP levels in patients without a history of stroke have not been evaluated. However, it may be sensible to consider BNP levels in decision-making about use of oral anticoagulation for patients with otherwise low-risk atrial fibrillation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30408566\"><span class=\"h2\">BNP and stroke outcome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elevated BNP levels are associated with increased poststroke mortality, although the incremental clinical utility of BNP measurement for predicting death after stroke is likely small. In a meta-analysis of individual data from 2258 patients with stroke, the addition of NT-proBNP to clinical variables resulted in a small improvement in prediction of mortality after stroke, reclassifying 8 percent of patients into more accurate risk categories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-biomarkers-for-stroke/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Progression intensified with increasing CRP levels even within the normal range, implicating a possible direct pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic vascular interaction. However, CRP concentration is more predictive of early carotid atherosclerotic activity and development than of extent of atherosclerosis or degree of carotid stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-biomarkers-for-stroke/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Elevated CRP levels have not been shown to be useful as a diagnostic marker for identifying stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) patients with significant carotid stenosis (&gt;50 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-biomarkers-for-stroke/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30408584\"><span class=\"h2\">CRP and stroke risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overall, available data do not suggest a clinically useful role of CRP measurement in estimating future stroke risk for either first or recurrent stroke.</p><p>A number studies have found an association between CRP and risk of first ischemic stroke in healthy adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-biomarkers-for-stroke/abstract/34-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-43</a>], but this association is frequently attenuated after adjustment for traditional vascular risk factors, and the degree of absolute risk increase is small. As an example, a meta-analysis of 54 prospective longitudinal studies and individual records from over 160,000 patients without history of vascular disease demonstrated a significant association between CRP concentration and risk of first ischemic stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-biomarkers-for-stroke/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Risk ratios per threefold higher CRP levels were 1.46 (95% CI 1.32-1.61) for ischemic stroke and 1.07 (95% CI 0.86-1.32) for hemorrhagic stroke. While the association with ischemic stroke remained significant after adjustment for conventional vascular risk factors, it was attenuated.</p><p>The utility of CRP for predicting the risk of recurrent ischemic events after an initial transient ischemic attack or stroke is unclear. One problem is that CRP levels increase acutely after stroke, raising uncertainty about the use of poststroke levels to predict long-term vascular risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-biomarkers-for-stroke/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].
