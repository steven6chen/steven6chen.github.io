In contrast, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) analogs belong to a different class of anti-osteoporosis drugs called &quot;anabolic&quot; agents. There are fundamental differences in the mode of action of and skeletal response to PTH and PTHrP analogs compared with antiresorptive drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-parathyroid-hormone-related-protein-analogs-for-osteoporosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the use of PTH and PTHrP analogs as a therapy for osteoporosis.

Increases in bone formation occur more quickly than bone resorption, leading to an increase in lumbar bone mineral density (BMD) that is greater in the first two years of treatment than any antiresorptive agent.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>PTH</strong> &ndash; Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is an 84-amino acid polypeptide secreted by the parathyroid glands in response to relatively small changes in serum calcium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F54710\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54710 \">figure 1</a>). PTH is one of the three key hormones modulating calcium and phosphate homeostasis; the other two are calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23). Through its actions to stimulate 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D production, renal tubular calcium reabsorption, and bone resorption, PTH is responsible for maintaining serum ionized calcium concentrations within a narrow range. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parathyroid-hormone-secretion-and-action\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parathyroid hormone secretion and action&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>PTHrP</strong> &ndash; Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) is produced in a wide variety of tissues and has diverse functions. It shares some of the actions of PTH, including stimulation of renal tubular calcium reabsorption and bone resorption, but it has minimal effect on intestinal calcium absorption, the latter due to weak stimulation of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D production. PTHrP also regulates cellular proliferation and is an important component of fetal calcium regulation, placental calcium transfer, and lactation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-parathyroid-hormone-related-protein-analogs-for-osteoporosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. PTHrP is produced by some cancers and is the primary cause of humeral hypercalcemia of malignancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypercalcemia-of-malignancy-mechanisms#H1048261776\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypercalcemia of malignancy: Mechanisms&quot;, section on 'PTH-related protein'</a>.)</p><p/><p>The classical parathyroid hormone receptor, PTH1R, recognizes both PTH and PTHrP due to the substantial degree of homology in the N-terminal parts of these two peptides. (The first two amino acids in the N-terminal region of the molecule are obligatory for activation of PTH1R.) This accounts for the ability of PTHrP to simulate some of the actions of PTH, including increases in bone resorption and distal tubular calcium reabsorption and inhibition of proximal tubular phosphate transport. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parathyroid-hormone-secretion-and-action#H2506925384\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parathyroid hormone secretion and action&quot;, section on 'Biological actions of PTH'</a>.)</p><p>Chronic exposure to PTH or PTHrP (as seen with primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism or hypercalcemia of malignancy, respectively) results in bone resorption. Given this observation, exogenous <span class=\"nowrap\">PTH/PTHrP</span> analogs would seem to be unlikely candidates for the treatment of osteoporosis. However, intermittent administration of recombinant human PTH (either full-length 1-84 or fragment 1-34) or PTHrP 1-34 has been shown to stimulate bone formation more than resorption and reduce fractures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2306116700\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF APPROACH</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2176144571\"><span class=\"h2\">Candidates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drugs that activate the PTH 1 receptor (PTH1R) are effective osteoporosis agents because they increase bone mineral density (BMD) and reduce fracture risk. Given their cost, subcutaneous route of administration, long-term safety concerns, and the availability of other agents, however, PTH and PTHrP analogs are generally not used as a first-line drug for treatment or prevention of osteoporosis.

Teriparatide has a long track record of safety, whereas there is limited experience with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abaloparatide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abaloparatide</a>.

(See <a href=\"#H3583321426\" class=\"local\">'Pretreatment evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients receiving <span class=\"nowrap\">PTH/PTHrP</span> analogs should take supplemental calcium and vitamin D. The total calcium intake (diet plus supplements) should be approximately 1000 to 1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> and should not exceed 1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. Vitamin D supplementation with approximately 800 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/day</span> is usually sufficient.

Previous or current bisphosphonate use, particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alendronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alendronate</a>, &quot;blunts&quot; the response to PTH.

Thus, in patients who are switching from bisphosphonates to PTH or PTHrP analogs, we suggest starting the drug immediately after bisphosphonates are discontinued (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).

This complication has rarely been observed in humans, and there is no direct evidence linking the development of osteosarcoma to dose or duration of teriparatide.
