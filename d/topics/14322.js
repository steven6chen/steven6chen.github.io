Night sweats and menopausal hot flashes are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with night sweats&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hot-flashes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Menopausal hot flashes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperhidrosis is the secretion of sweat in amounts greater than physiologically needed for thermoregulation. It is most commonly a chronic idiopathic (primary) condition; however, secondary medical conditions or medications should be excluded. Idiopathic hyperhidrosis localized to certain areas of the body is called primary focal hyperhidrosis. Primary focal hyperhidrosis usually affects the axillae, palms, and soles. The condition may also affect other sites, such as the face, scalp, inguinal, and inframammary areas.</p><p>A consensus panel suggested the following diagnostic criteria for primary focal hyperhidrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focal, visible, excessive sweating of at least six months duration without apparent cause</p><p/><p>Plus at least two of the following characteristics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bilateral and relatively symmetric</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impairs daily activities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At least one episode per week</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Onset before age 25</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family history of idiopathic hyperhidrosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focal sweating stops during sleep</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with primary focal hyperhidrosis generally develop symptoms in childhood or adolescence that persist throughout life. Patients have focal symptoms most often localized to the palms, soles, and axillae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Less commonly, primary focal hyperhidrosis may affect the scalp and face, or other sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. While primary focal hyperhidrosis is made worse by heat or emotional stimuli, it is not considered a psychological disorder.</p><p>Patients with axillary hyperhidrosis report skin maceration and staining of clothes. Palmar hyperhidrosis often leads to a fear of shaking hands and soiling of papers, and patients may have difficulty with work or recreational tasks that require a dry grip. Patients report that hyperhidrosis often results in social problems on both a private and professional level.</p><p>Hyperhidrosis is associated with an increased incidence of other cutaneous disorders. In a retrospective case-control study involving 387 patients with primary focal hyperhidrosis, patients with hyperhidrosis were more likely to suffer from dermatophytosis, pitted keratolysis, and viral warts at the sites of hyperhidrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition, atopic dermatitis and other eczematous dermatitides were present at a greater frequency in subjects with hyperhidrosis. The reason for this association is unknown; one theory is that hyperhidrosis is an exacerbating factor for dermatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperhidrosis prevalence estimates range from 1 to 5 percent of the population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/3,5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5-8</a>].</p><p>A study of patients with primary palmar hyperhidrosis who had been treated with thoracoscopic sympathectomy found that 49 of 58 patients and none of 20 controls reported a family history of hyperhidrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], which suggests a genetic component to the disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sweating assists thermoregulation, skin hydration, and fluid and electrolyte balance. Three types of sweat glands, eccrine, apocrine, and apoeccrine glands have been described in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Eccrine sweat glands are responsible for hyperhidrosis, although apoeccrine glands might play a role in axillary hyperhidrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The primary function of eccrine sweat glands is thermoregulation, with cooling resulting from evaporation of eccrine sweat. Eccrine sweat glands are located throughout the body, but they are found in greatest quantity in the palms, soles, and (to a lesser degree) axillae. Sweating on the face, chest, and back is generally due to heat stimuli, while sweating of the palms and soles is due to emotional stress. The axillae have eccrine, apocrine, and apoeccrine glands. Thermal sweating can occur throughout the day, but emotional sweating (palms, soles, and to some degree axillae) stops while sleeping [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>Eccrine glands are innervated by the sympathetic nervous system but utilize acetylcholine as the primary neurotransmitter. Thermal and emotional sweating are controlled by different regions of the brain. Thermal sweating is controlled by the hypothalamus via the thermosensitive preoptic sweat center, while emotional sweating is regulated by the cerebral cortex. A sympathetic signal is carried to endocrine glands via cholinergic autonomic neurons. In patients with primary focal hyperhidrosis, the sweat glands are usually histologically and functionally normal. Rather, the cause of hyperhidrosis appears to be an abnormal or exaggerated central response to normal emotional stress.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with primary focal hyperhidrosis generally have hyperhidrosis involving the face, scalp, palms, soles, or axillae. Generalized sweating suggests an etiology other than primary focal hyperhidrosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4382518\"><span class=\"h2\">Secondary hyperhidrosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common cause of generalized sweating is excessive heat. Generalized hyperhidrosis can be due to systemic diseases or medications. Unlike primary focal hyperhidrosis, patients with generalized, secondary hyperhidrosis usually present as adults and report sweating that occurs both while awake and sleeping. A history of generalized hyperhidrosis requires a careful evaluation for systemic causes. The differential diagnosis for generalized hyperhidrosis is similar to the differential diagnosis of night sweats (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with night sweats&quot;</a>). One should evaluate for signs and symptoms of an infectious cause such as tuberculosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], or endocarditis; a malignant etiology such as lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]; or an endocrinopathy such as carcinoid syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], pheochromocytoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], or hyperthyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Medications should be carefully reviewed, as many can cause generalized sweating (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F56351\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56351 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>While menopause is a common cause of excessive sweating, clinicians should perform a careful history and examination before concluding that excessive sweating in a woman of perimenopausal age is due to hot flashes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hot-flashes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Menopausal hot flashes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other causes of excessive sweating include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with previous spinal cord injuries may occasionally develop episodes of diffuse sweating long after their injury. These sweating episodes can be due to an autonomic dysreflexia, orthostatic hypotension, or a posttraumatic syringomyelia. Hyperhidrosis attributed to autonomic dysreflexia is caused by an exaggerated autonomic response to normal stimuli such as bowel and bladder distention or skin irritation. In addition to sweating of the face, neck, and trunk, patients generally have flushing of the face and a throbbing headache. Their spinal cord lesion is usually at or above the sixth thoracic level. A post-traumatic syringomyelia may occur months to years after the development of paraplegia from a spinal cord injury of any level. The syrinx may develop above or below the level of the transection and may be associated with progressive numbness of the hyperhidrotic areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gustatory sweating (mild sweating around the lips, nose, and forehead) occurs normally with the consumption of hot, spicy foods. However, pathologic gustatory sweating may be caused by sympathetic nerve damage, either due to invasion (such as a Pancoast tumor), or by sympathectomy (see <a href=\"#H78744208\" class=\"local\">'Sympathectomy'</a> below). It can also be due to a diabetic neuropathy, herpes zoster of the preauricular region, or misdirection of autonomic nerve fibers following parotid surgery (Frey's syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4381104\"><span class=\"h2\">Colored sweat</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chromhidrosis is an uncommon, idiopathic, non-hyperhidrotic condition in which apocrine glands secrete colored sweat (eg, yellow, blue, green, or black). Chromhidrosis can occur on the face (particularly malar cheeks), axillae, areolae, groin, and other areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. Chromhidrosis is reviewed in detail separately.

Additional factors, such as the patient's goals, expectations, and preferences, as well as safety concerns, disease severity, cost, and treatment availability also impact treatment selection. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H706301016\"><span class=\"h2\">Axillary hyperhidrosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major therapeutic options for axillary hyperhidrosis include antiperspirants, botulinum toxin, microwave thermolysis, oral medications, and surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H706301774\"><span class=\"h3\">First-line therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical antiperspirants are the preferred initial treatment for axillary hyperhidrosis because they are widely available, inexpensive, and well-tolerated therapies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H706303603\"><span class=\"h4\">Antiperspirants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most commercially available nonprescription antiperspirants contain a low-dose metal salt (usually aluminum) that physically obstructs the opening of sweat gland ducts. Nonprescription products are only successful in treating patients with very mild hyperhidrosis.</p><p>Treatment with prescription antiperspirants, such as 20% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aluminum-chloride-hexahydrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aluminum chloride hexahydrate</a> or 6.25% aluminum chloride hexahydrate, may provide adequate therapy for patients with axillary hyperhidrosis that fails to respond to nonprescription antiperspirants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H706303135\" class=\"local\">'Palmar or plantar hyperhidrosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Efficacy </strong>&ndash; The mechanism through which aluminum salts are thought to improve hyperhidrosis involves precipitation of the metal ions with mucopolysaccharides after application to the skin, leading to damage of epithelial cells within of the lumina of sweat ducts and the formation of plugs that occlude the ducts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Administration </strong>&ndash; Prescription strength antiperspirants should be applied nightly to the area of hyperhidrosis until improvement is noted; significant improvement may be noted within one week. The interval between applications then can be gradually lengthened. Once-weekly applications are typically needed for maintenance therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Unfortunately, treatment with strong antiperspirants is often limited by skin irritation, especially in the axillary region. Low-potency corticosteroid creams (such as 2.5% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> cream) can help alleviate axillary irritation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">To reduce the risk of irritation, these products should be applied to dry skin between episodes of sweating. Ideally, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aluminum-chloride-hexahydrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aluminum chloride hexahydrate</a> should be applied at bedtime when hyperhidrosis is at a minimum, allowed to remain in place for six to eight hours, and washed off in the morning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Others have recommended using a hair dryer to quickly dry the skin before application and immediately after application, or to use baking soda powder in the morning to neutralize any remaining aluminum chloride [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We do <strong>not</strong> instruct patients to occlude treated areas with plastic wrap or other occlusive materials after the application of prescription antiperspirants. Occlusion is not necessary and may increase risk for irritation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Use of an additional antiperspirant product during the daytime also is not necessary. Patients who desire to use a fragranced product may apply a non-medicated deodorant to the axillae in the morning after bathing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H706301781\"><span class=\"h3\">Second-line therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who do not achieve sufficient improvement in axillary hyperhidrosis with topical antiperspirants may benefit from botulinum toxin injections or microwave thermolysis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H706301202\"><span class=\"h4\">Botulinum toxin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Periodic botulinum toxin injection into affected skin is a safe and effective method for improving axillary hyperhidrosis. However, treatment can be painful and expensive.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Efficacy </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Botulinum toxin blocks the release of neuronal acetylcholine from the presynaptic junction of both neuromuscular and cholinergic autonomic neurons. By blocking the release of acetylcholine, botulinum toxin can temporarily reduce sweat production. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although other formulations of botulinum toxin may improve hyperhidrosis, most studies have used <a href=\"topic.htm?path=onabotulinumtoxina-botox-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">onabotulinumtoxinA</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abobotulinumtoxina-dysport-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abobotulinumtoxinA</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Dosing of these agents is not equivalent; 1 unit of onabotulinumtoxinA is equal to approximately 3 units of abobotulinumtoxinA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for botulinum toxin for hyperhidrosis is limited to onabotulinumtoxinA for axillary hyperhidrosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Several studies support the efficacy of BTX-A in the treatment of axillary hyperhidrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/29-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-35</a>]. Examples include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a randomized trial involving 320 patients with bilateral primary axillary hyperhidrosis, response rates after four weeks were significantly higher with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=onabotulinumtoxina-botox-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">onabotulinumtoxinA</a>, 50 units per axilla, than placebo (94 versus 36 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. After 16 weeks, 82 percent of the onabotulinumtoxinA group still had an effective response compared with 21 percent of the placebo group. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a randomized trial involving 145 patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis unresponsive to topical therapy with aluminum chloride, patients were injected with 200 units of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abobotulinumtoxina-dysport-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abobotulinumtoxinA</a> in one axilla and placebo in the other; after two weeks, the treatments were revealed, and the axilla that had been treated with placebo was injected with 100 units of abobotulinumtoxinA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Two weeks after the initial injection, the rate of sweat production was significantly less on the side treated with abobotulinumtoxinA (24 versus 144 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/min)</span>. Two weeks after the injection with 100 U, the rate of sweat production decreased from 144 to 32 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/min</span>. The mean reduction in sweating was greater with the 200 units injection (81.4 versus 76.5 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although the above study found a statistically greater reduction in sweating with 200 units of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abobotulinumtoxina-dysport-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abobotulinumtoxinA</a>, it is not clear that this difference is clinically important. A study of 43 patients found no difference in the degree or duration of reduction in sweating with 100 or 200 units of abobotulinumtoxinA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A response to treatment is usually evident within two to four days and improvement in sweating typically persists for three to nine months or longer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The duration of efficacy may increase with subsequent injections. In a retrospective study of 83 patients given an average of four <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abobotulinumtoxina-dysport-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abobotulinumtoxinA</a> injection sessions for axillary hyperhidrosis (range 2 to 17 sessions) and followed for an average of 2.7 years (range 3 months to 9 years), the median duration of effect (as reported by patients) was 5.5 months after the initial injection and 8.5 months after the last injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. An increase in the duration of effect of botulinum toxin may result from lengthening of the time required for regrowth of the axon terminal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Additional studies are needed to confirm the findings of this study. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Neutralizing antibody development, which occasionally has been linked to reduced therapeutic effectiveness in patients treated with botulinum toxin for other indications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>], appears to be infrequent among patients treated for axillary hyperhidrosis and does not necessarily result in a failure to respond to treatment. In an analysis of data from trials of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=onabotulinumtoxina-botox-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">onabotulinumtoxinA</a> therapy for various indications, only 4 of 871 patients (0.5 percent) treated for axillary hyperhidrosis developed neutralizing antibodies against botulinum toxin, and the two patients who received subsequent injections after developing neutralizing antibodies continued to respond to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Administration </strong>&ndash; Optimal treatment of hyperhidrosis with botulinum toxin is dependent upon accurate identification of the specific areas of hyperhidrosis. Hyperhidrotic areas of the axilla do not necessarily correlate with the distribution of terminal axillary hair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The Minor iodine starch test, a simple method to identify the responsible areas, is performed with the following steps:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dry the affected region with absorbent paper</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Apply a 3 to 5% iodine solution to the axilla and adjacent skin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Apply dry starch over the area of iodine application</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Note areas in which a dark purple color appears (areas of sweat production)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Mark the areas of sweat production with a marking pen</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A 30-gauge needle is used to inject the botulinum toxin into the dermis or superficial fat. Typically 10 to 20 injections spaced 1 to 2 cm apart are performed in each axilla. For <a href=\"topic.htm?path=onabotulinumtoxina-botox-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">onabotulinumtoxinA</a> the average dose used per axilla is 50 to 100 U; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abobotulinumtoxina-dysport-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abobotulinumtoxinA</a> treatment usually requires 100 to 300 units per axilla [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Pain during injections is one of the most common complaints with this therapy. A topical anesthetic may be applied after the Minor iodine starch test to reduce pain. Cryoanalgesia (refrigerant sprays or ice packs) or vibration anesthesia also may be of some benefit in decreasing pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/41-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-45</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22251782\"><span class=\"h4\">Microwave thermolysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Microwave energy can be utilized to destroy eccrine glands and relieve hyperhidrosis in the axilla [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/46-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-50</a>]. A commercial device designed to focus microwave energy onto the dermal-adipose interface has been approved by the FDA and is commercially available. Limited availability and cost may limit access to this therapy. </p><p>The use of microwave energy for axillary hyperhidrosis is supported by a randomized trial of 120 adults with primary axillary hyperhidrosis who were given one to three treatments with a microwave energy device (n = 81) or a sham device (n = 39) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Patients treated with the microwave device were more likely to notice a subjective reduction in the severity of axillary hyperhidrosis 30 days after treatment than patients in the sham treatment group (89 versus 54 percent). The difference in favor of active treatment remained statistically significant for up to six months. In addition, more patients in the active group achieved at least a 50 or 75 percent reduction in a gravimetric measurement of sweat production through six months after treatment.

The most common side effects of treatment are altered skin sensation (median duration 25 days, range 4 to 225 days), discomfort, and other local reactions. Transient median and ulnar neuropathy after microwave thermolysis also has been reported in a patient treated for axillary hyperhidrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H706303550\"><span class=\"h3\">Other therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Additional therapies that may improve axillary hyperhidrosis include systemic agents, surgical interventions, and iontophoresis. Concern for adverse effects or limited efficacy data make these agents less favorable options for initial therapy.</p><p>We agree with the stepwise approach outlined by the International Hyperhidrosis Society for patients who cannot be managed with first-line and second-line therapies. Patients are first considered for an alternative local treatment (suction curettage), followed by systemic agents, then endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (ETS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22252008\"><span class=\"h4\">Suction curettage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For many years axillary hyperhidrosis was surgically treated with subcutaneous curettage or excision of the skin containing eccrine glands. However, this procedure has a significant failure rate and is associated with permanent scarring and the risk of restricted arm movement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Minimally invasive suction curettage, a newer local surgical technique for removing axillary eccrine and apocrine sweat glands, may have improved outcomes and decreased morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/55-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-63</a>].</p><p>Suction curettage involves the use of tumescent anesthesia followed by cannula suction of the superficial subcutis to remove sweat glands. Additional studies are necessary to determine the role of suction curettage in the therapeutic algorithm for hyperhidrosis. We consider suction curettage as a therapeutic option for patients who cannot be managed with topical therapies or botulinum toxin injection and as an alternative to thoracic sympathectomy.</p><p>The first randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy of suction curettage compared suction curettage to botulinum toxin injection and found a trend towards better results with botulinum toxin treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. In this study, 20 patients with axillary hyperhidrosis were randomly assigned to receive suction curettage in the right axilla and injection of 50 units of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=onabotulinumtoxina-botox-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">onabotulinumtoxinA</a> in the left axilla or vice versa. Three months after treatment, there were nonstatistically significant trends toward greater reductions in resting and exercise-induced sweat rates in axillae treated with botulinum toxin (72 and 74 percent reductions, respectively) than in axillae treated with suction curettage (60 and 59 percent reductions, respectively). In a subgroup of &quot;heavy sweater&quot; axillae, exercise-induced sweat rates were significantly lower after botulinum toxin injection than after suction curettage, indicating a better response to botulinum toxin treatment. Among all patients, a validated quality of life questionnaire revealed significantly greater patient satisfaction with botulinum toxin therapy three and six months after treatment.</p><p>Ideally, the permanent removal of axillary sweat glands via suction curettage would result in permanent improvement of hyperhidrosis, unlike non-surgical local interventions. However, the limited amount of outcomes data on suction curettage and variation in surgical technique among studies preclude definitive conclusions about the long-term efficacy of the procedure. The potential for long-term benefit is supported by a prospective study of 28 patients that found reductions in resting and exercise-induced sweat rates of 70 and 86 percent one month after treatment, and 58 and 87 percent, respectively, after one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-focal-hyperhidrosis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Treatment results at one year were graded as excellent, good, or satisfactory by 25, 14, and 24 percent of patients, respectively.</p><p>Continued hyperhidrosis after suction curettage may occur as a result of skipped areas or compensatory sweating. The skill of the surgeon performing the procedure also may influence treatment efficacy.

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with generalized hyperhidrosis not limited to the palms, soles, and axillae are likely to have hyperhidrosis secondary to medications or a systemic illness, and the evaluation is similar to that done for night sweats. (See <a href=\"#H4382518\" class=\"local\">'Secondary hyperhidrosis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with night sweats&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When choosing treatments for primary focal hyperhidrosis, the patient's goals in therapy should be understood and the side effects associated with each therapy should be carefully discussed. Conservative measures should be tried before progressing to more invasive treatments. The severity and location of hyperhidrosis helps guide the choice of therapies. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with axillary, palmar, or plantar hyperhidrosis should initially be treated with topical antiperspirants such as 20% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aluminum-chloride-hexahydrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aluminum chloride hexahydrate</a> or 6.25% aluminum chloride hexahydrate. Skin irritation is a common side effect that may be reduced with proper application technique or a low-potency topical corticosteroid. Iontophoresis is an alternative initial treatment for patients with palmar or plantar hyperhidrosis. (See <a href=\"#H706301016\" class=\"local\">'Axillary hyperhidrosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H706303135\" class=\"local\">'Palmar or plantar hyperhidrosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Botulinum toxin injection is an effective second-line treatment for axillary hyperhidrosis and microwave thermolysis is a less-widely available alternative. Palmar and plantar hyperhidrosis can also be treated with botulinum toxin, but the injections are quite painful on the hands and feet, and a significant percentage of patients develop temporary local muscle weakness. (See <a href=\"#H706301781\" class=\"local\">'Second-line therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with axillary hyperhidrosis who cannot be managed effectively with first- or second-line treatments may benefit from suction curettage, a local surgical intervention. If this is not feasible or effective, our preferred next therapy is systemic medication. Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (ETS) is an additional option. The selection of these treatments should follow careful consideration of the associated risks and side effects. (See <a href=\"#H706303550\" class=\"local\">'Other therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with palmar hyperhidrosis who cannot be managed effectively with antiperspirants, iontophoresis, or botulinum toxin are candidates for systemic medications or sympathectomy. (See <a href=\"#H706303219\" class=\"local\">'Other therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First-line therapies for craniofacial hyperhidrosis include topical antiperspirants. Patients who cannot be managed with topical therapy may benefit from botulinum toxin injections or oral medication.
