Eating disorders are most often found in adolescent and young adult women; thus, they often come to medical attention during pregnancy when weight and eating habits are closely monitored. For some women with eating disorders, pregnancy is an opportunity for recovery (comparable to stopping tobacco or alcohol use); for other patients, pregnancy is a period of vulnerability for onset, persistence, or relapse of eating disorder symptoms.</p><p>This topic reviews pregnancy, birth, and postpartum outcomes in the context of eating disorders; the course of eating disorders during and after pregnancy; and management of eating disorders that is specific to pregnant women.

As an example, diagnoses may be imprecise because they are derived from registry data or questionnaire self-report, rather than clinical evaluations. In addition, results are often presented for women with histories of eating disorders that may not have been active during the pregnancies that were studied. Furthermore, analyses in many studies were not adjusted for potential confounders such as maternal age, smoking, and prepregnancy body mass index. Specific eating disorders differ in their clinical features and treatment; thus, studies that examine eating disorders collectively are less informative than studies of specific disorders. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104894568\"><span class=\"h1\">ANOREXIA NERVOSA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Estimating the prevalence of anorexia nervosa in pregnant women is complicated by the difficulty in determining low body weight in women who are gaining weight due to pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eating-disorders-in-pregnancy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The best estimate comes from a community studies of pregnant women in Norway and the Netherlands, which found that in the 6 to 12 months prior to becoming pregnant, the prevalence of anorexia nervosa was 0.1 to 0.3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eating-disorders-in-pregnancy/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The true prevalence is probably higher because patients often conceal their illness.</p><p>Although anorexia nervosa manifests with amenorrhea in approximately 70 to 90 percent of patients, fertility rates in women with a history of anorexia nervosa and women in the general population appear to be comparable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eating-disorders-in-pregnancy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

However, differences in nutrient intake are generally not observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eating-disorders-in-pregnancy/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>Smoking appears to be common in pregnant patients with anorexia nervosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eating-disorders-in-pregnancy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

The clinicians must agree with each other and the patient that there are no secrets between the clinicians, and that the clinicians will regularly communicate about any concerns that arise, as well as important issues such as the rate of weight gain. Severely ill patients will also need referral to an eating disorders program. </p><p>The dietary habits of pregnant patients with eating disorders must be monitored to ensure proper weight gain and fetal growth, and nutritional guidance should be provided. In addition, the patient should be asked about use of drugs potentially harmful in pregnancy, including antidepressants and other medications used for mood disorders (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a>), appetite suppressants, benzodiazepines, diuretics, and excess use of laxatives. </p><p>Clinicians monitoring weight gain should weigh patients in a hospital gown; patients with anorexia nervosa may attempt to conceal their true weight by hiding objects in their clothes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eating-disorders-in-pregnancy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In addition, patients may inflate their body weight drinking water. Some patients may prefer to not know their weight, which should be honored, unless weight gain is inadequate. Poor weight gain should prompt a discussion of the nutritional needs of the fetus and the need to eat for the baby, with less focus upon the patient&rsquo;s own weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eating-disorders-in-pregnancy/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>].
