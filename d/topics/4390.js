Up to half of complications occur at the time of abdominal access for camera or port placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Complications can also arise from abdominal insufflation, tissue dissection, and hemostasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Conversion to an open procedure may be needed to manage complications that have been identified intraoperatively, while others may not be recognized until the postoperative period. Severe complications such as vascular injury and bowel perforation can be catastrophic and are the main cause of procedure-specific morbidity and mortality related to laparoscopic surgery. </p><p>Much of the literature discussing the complications associated with laparoscopic surgery is drawn from the gynecologic literature, which has provided the most comprehensive study of these injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. It is presumed that results from these studies can be generalized to other abdominal and retroperitoneal surgeries, but wherever possible, outcomes of laparoscopic surgery in gynecology, general surgery, and urology are distinguished.</p><p>Surgical complications unique to a laparoscopic approach are discussed here. Surgical techniques and their specific complications are discussed in individual topic reviews. Other general issues relating to laparoscopic surgery, including abdominal access and instrumentation, are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-access-techniques-used-in-laparoscopic-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal access techniques used in laparoscopic surgery&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=instruments-and-devices-used-in-laparoscopic-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Instruments and devices used in laparoscopic surgery&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-gynecologic-laparoscopic-surgery-and-non-umbilical-entry-sites\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of gynecologic laparoscopic surgery and non-umbilical entry sites&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-laparoscopy-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of laparoscopy in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H860575245\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rate of complications associated specifically with a laparoscopic approach is overall low. Complications related to initial abdominal access occur in less than 1 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. Once abdominal access is established, complications during the course of the procedure are similarly rare; however, late hernia at port sites can affect up to 6 percent of patients. The incidence of specific complications for specific laparoscopic procedures is discussed more fully in the sections below. The following studies illustrate typical findings: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One survey reported results of claims arising from abdominal access injuries between 1980 and 1999, and medical device reports to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The incidence of abdominal access injury was 5 to 30 per 10,000 procedures. Bowel and retroperitoneal vascular injuries comprised 76 percent of all injuries, and almost 50 percent of small and large bowel injuries were unrecognized for at least 24 hours. The type and proportion of organ injury during abdominal access were as follows: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Small bowel (25 percent) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Iliac artery (19 percent) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Colon (12 percent) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Iliac or other retroperitoneal vein (9 percent) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Secondary branches of a mesenteric vessel (7 percent) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Aorta (6 percent) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Inferior vena cava (4 percent) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Abdominal wall vessels (4 percent) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Bladder (3 percent) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Liver (2 percent) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Other (less than 2 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A review of gynecologic procedures performed from 1975 to 2002 reported that access-related bowel injuries occurred in 4.4 per 10,000 procedures, and entry-related vascular injuries occurred in 3.1 per 10,000 procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. An open abdominal access technique (eg, Hasson) was not associated with fewer complications than a closed entry technique. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An analysis of 629 trocar injuries reported to the FDA included 408 injuries to major blood vessels, 182 other injuries (mainly bowel injuries), and 30 abdominal wall hematomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Among the 32 deaths, 26 were due to vascular injuries and 6 deaths resulted from bowel injuries. Injury to the aorta and inferior vena cava were the vessels most commonly resulting in death. The diagnosis of gastrointestinal perforation was delayed in 10 percent of cases, and the mortality rate among these patients was 21 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective study of 403 patients who underwent laparoscopic abdominal surgery found a complication rate of 3 percent after a minimum of three months of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Consistent with other studies, complications were mostly related to the abdominal access site (75 percent) and included (in order of frequency) abdominal wall hematoma, port-site hernia, and port site infection. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H860571897\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who have had prior surgery for intraabdominal or pelvic disease (eg, diverticulitis, pelvic inflammatory disease) have a higher risk of complications related to adhesions compared with patients who do not have this past history. Other conditions that increase the risk of complications include extensive bowel distention, very large abdominal or pelvic mass, and diaphragmatic hernia. In addition, patients with poor cardiopulmonary reserve may not be candidates for abdominal insufflation given the physiologic changes related to pneumoperitoneum. For patients with risk factors for complications, the laparoscopic approach and approach to abdominal access need to be carefully planned; an open approach may be preferred.</p><p>The frequency of complications may be related to surgeon experience and the number of the specific procedure performed for some, but not all, types of surgical procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Studies focusing on various laparoscopic surgeries have had mixed conclusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/14-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-19</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the treatment of acute cholecystitis, lower surgeon volume was a predictor of the need for open conversion and prolonged length of hospital stay, but did not predict the rate of bile duct injury or mortality in a large review of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A survey of 181 urologic surgeons following completion of a supplemental laparoscopy course found that surgeons who did not participate were threefold to fivefold more likely to have at least one complication at 3 and 12 months, respectively, compared with surgeons who participated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a comparison of complications of open (n = 512) and laparoscopic (n = 112) bowel resection performed by four study surgeons, surgical volume and training had no relationship to the incidence of complications, which varied from 9 to 47 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Rather, an inflammatory indication was a strong predictor of technical complications. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a review of a nationwide inpatient database, the overall rates for complications related to laparoscopic hysterectomy were similar for low-volume versus for high-volume surgeons (9.8 and 10.4 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. No differences were found for intraoperative complications, surgical site complications, medical complications, transfusion, or reoperation. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H860574403\"><span class=\"h1\">RELATED TO ABDOMINAL ACCESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Potential complications arising from initial abdominal access to insufflate the abdomen and place the laparoscopic camera, and the abdominal ports needed to introduce laparoscopic instruments, include vascular injury, gastrointestinal perforation, solid visceral injury, nerve injury, port-site hernia, and surgical site infection. Access-related vascular and gastrointestinal injuries are the leading causes of fatalities following laparoscopic surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Most reviews reporting complications related to abdominal access are drawn from the gynecologic literature. In one large review of gynecologic laparoscopy, over 50 percent of these complications occurred during abdominal access [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. As laparoscopic techniques became more widely adopted, reports of morbidity and mortality related to laparoscopic complications increased related to the increased number of procedures and to the well-defined learning curve associated with the adoption of laparoscopic techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. For laparoscopic cholecystectomy, complications of abdominal access and abdominal insufflation were also found to be the most frequent cause of morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. A review of 1399 trocar-associated injuries and fatalities reported in the Food and Drug administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database found a high proportion of reports were associated with laparoscopic cholecystectomy compared with other laparoscopic procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. This likely reflects the high prevalence of this procedure as the most common laparoscopic procedure performed in the United States. The majority of complications were related to user technique. A device issue or failure contributed in 8 percent of reported complications; however, approximately one-third of devices were not assessed because they were not returned to the manufacturer or the condition of the device prevented evaluation. </p><p>Knowledge of proper access techniques is crucial to avoid these complications. However, no significant differences in overall complication rates have been found for closed compared with open techniques for primary abdominal insufflation, when performed by experienced surgeons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/9,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,22,23</a>]. Most severe injuries are due to blind insertion of access devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/24-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-28</a>]. Although the results of several retrospective reviews can be used to justify the use of blind techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/29-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-34</a>], many surgeons prefer a visual entry technique to place primary trocars; secondary <span class=\"nowrap\">trocar/ports</span> should always be placed under direct laparoscopic vision with the abdomen insufflated. Abdominal access techniques are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-access-techniques-used-in-laparoscopic-surgery#H651891644\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal access techniques used in laparoscopic surgery&quot;, section on 'Choice of technique'</a>.)</p><p>Conversion to an open procedure may be required to manage complications of abdominal access. In a systematic review in the early experience with laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 15 percent of conversions <span class=\"nowrap\">(1400/78,747</span> patients) were due to access-related complications such as bleeding or bowel injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H860573093\"><span class=\"h2\">Vascular injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The overall reported rate of vascular injury (arterial or venous injury) ranges from 0.1 to 6.4 per 1000 laparoscopies. Most injuries involve minor vessels; however, underreporting is common. Vascular injury most commonly occurs during abdominal access and is second only to anesthesia as a cause of death from laparoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/36-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-45</a>]. In one review, the mortality rate among patients suffering a vascular injury was 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p>Vascular injury most commonly occurs while placing a pneumoperitoneum needle (eg, Veress) or primary trocar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/40,45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,45-47</a>]. Although a Veress needle is often implicated as the cause of distal aortic or iliac vessel injury, vascular injuries can occur with any of the available devices using open or closed techniques, during any laparoscopic procedure, including those in the upper abdomen. In the review of the MAUDE database described above, <span class=\"nowrap\">4/9</span> fatal aortic injuries occurred during laparoscopic cholecystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p>Vascular injuries related to abdominal access can be grouped into major and minor vascular injuries. Major vascular injuries affect major vessels such as the aorta, inferior vena cava, and iliac vessels, while minor vascular injuries affect vessels of the abdominal wall, mesentery, or other organs. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2218431150\"><span class=\"h3\">Minor vessels</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vascular complications most commonly result from laceration of minor vessels. Although the injured vessel is considered minor, these injuries are more often a cause for transfusion, conversion to an open procedure, or reoperation. Minor superficial bleeding sites can usually be identified using probing instruments or an irrigator-aspirator. Once identified, the site can be coagulated or clipped. The use of laparoscopic instruments for hemostasis and management of complications of laparoscopic entry are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H104329811\" class=\"local\">'Management of hemorrhage'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hemorrhage-in-gynecologic-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hemorrhage in gynecologic surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>During initial abdominal access to establish pneumoperitoneum, the omental and mesenteric vessels are most commonly injured, particularly if there are adhesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/1,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,48</a>]. The most common vascular injury overall is laceration of the inferior epigastric artery during placement of lateral trocars (usually as secondary trocars) in the lower abdomen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Injury to the inferior epigastric vessels is more common than injury to the superior epigastric vessels, likely because the superior epigastric vessels in the upper abdominal wall often form a plexus of arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Cutting trocars with sharp blades are more likely to injure vessels compared with smooth, conical-tip trocars that push the vessel out of the way [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Partial lacerations of the inferior epigastric artery vessels may not spontaneously stop bleeding because the vessel is tethered and cannot retract and spasm. Similar to the inferior epigastric vessels, other abdominal wall vessels can be injured, particularly if the trocar is not placed under direct vision, and if secondary trocars are placed without prior transillumination of the abdominal wall to identify their presence.</p><p>Bleeding due to a vascular injury at a port site may not be observed with the port site cannulas in place and the abdomen insufflated due to tamponade. Delayed bleeding can occur after the patient has been transferred from the operating room, typically within one hour [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. However, delayed abdominal wall hematomas can present two or three days after surgery. Clinical manifestations include abdominal wall pain, abdominal wall or flank ecchymosis, and external bleeding from a trocar site. Patients can also present initially with hemodynamic instability due to significant blood loss from a port site that bleeds internally.</p><p>Patients with an abdominal wall hematoma from laparoscopic access who are hemodynamically stable and with no signs of hematoma expansion can be managed conservatively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F111155\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef111155 \">image 1</a>). The hematoma may drain spontaneously through one or more port sites. Intervention is indicated if the hematoma expands, the patient becomes hemodynamically unstable, or the hematoma becomes infected. For some patients, percutaneous embolization of the bleeding vessel may be an option; however, rapidly expanding hematomas leading to hemodynamic instability or infected hematomas are more effectively managed using an open surgical approach. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2218431144\"><span class=\"h3\">Major vessels</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rarely, injury to a major retroperitoneal vessel occurs, with incidences ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/23,24,26,27,39,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24,26,27,39,52</a>]. Injury to major venous structures (eg, inferior vena cava, iliac vein) can also occur, and massive air embolism has also been reported due to unrecognized intravenous placement of a pneumoperitoneum needle and subsequent gas insufflation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p>Major vascular injuries may occur due to a lack of appreciation for the proximity of important vascular structures to the anterior abdominal wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The distance from the anterior abdominal wall to the aorta can be as little as 2 cm in thin individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. The distal aorta, which lies directly beneath the umbilicus, and right common iliac artery, which crosses the midline, are each particularly prone to injury. Techniques for minimizing vascular injuries are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-access-techniques-used-in-laparoscopic-surgery#H651891644\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal access techniques used in laparoscopic surgery&quot;, section on 'Choice of technique'</a>.)</p><p>Injury to the aorta or iliac vessels during abdominal access can lead to rapid exsanguination and death unless prompt vascular control and repair are undertaken [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/10,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,54</a>]. Major vascular injuries may be recognized immediately by observing free blood in the abdominal cavity. However, vascular injury may not be appreciated right away, due to bleeding into the mesentery or retroperitoneum rather than into the peritoneal cavity. Managing injury to a major vessel requires subspecialty expertise, and consultation with a surgeon experienced with vascular procedures should be obtained without delay. The anesthesia team should be immediately notified that there is a problem. For patients in lithotomy position (eg, gynecologic, rectal surgery), it is advisable to maintain the extremities in an elevated position to minimize hypotension. For upper abdominal procedures for which the patient has been placed into reverse Trendelenburg position, the bed should be flattened, or placed into Trendelenburg position, as needed. If a vascular or trauma surgeon is not immediately available (community facility, ambulatory surgery center), we advocate a damage control approach as used in trauma surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. To minimize ongoing blood loss, the abdomen should be rapidly opened with a midline incision, pressure should be applied directly to the bleeding site for initial control, and the abdominal cavity can be packed, if needed. These maneuvers allow for fluid resuscitation while awaiting the vascular or trauma surgeon, or arrangements for immediate transfer if subspecialty expertise is not available. Techniques for packing the abdomen in the setting of acute hemorrhage are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of splenic injury in the adult trauma patient&quot;, section on 'Packing'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-damage-control-surgery-and-resuscitation-in-patients-sustaining-severe-injury#H1488736\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of damage control surgery and resuscitation in patients sustaining severe injury&quot;, section on 'Damage control laparotomy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104329811\"><span class=\"h3\">Management of hemorrhage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prevention of bleeding by meticulous hemostasis during dissection is a fundamental principle of laparoscopic surgery. The identification of significant hemorrhage should prompt the surgeon to immediately notify the anesthesiologist for fluid resuscitation, transfusion, or potential need to convert to an open procedure. </p><p>When significant hemorrhage occurs during the course of laparoscopic surgery, it is often due to a technical error, such as inadvertent cautery away from the field of dissection; excessive thermal spread; improper staple length, height, or stapling technique; or failure to recognize a significant vascular structure prior to its division with nonvascular stapling instrument. </p><p>Mild-to-moderate bleeding can often be controlled with compressive maneuvers. Local compression allows a surgeon time to consider strategies for definitive hemostasis and may, in itself, be a definitive treatment. Most small to medium-sized vessels will spasm, and bleeding slows and often stops altogether with simple compression. To provide local compression, a gauze sponge can be passed through a 10 mm port to compress the identified area of bleeding. Soaking the sponge with dilute (1:10,000 or 1:100,000) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> has also been described for controlling bleeding during laparoscopic cholecystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>] and laparoscopic Heller myotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Under some circumstances, a piece of healthy and mobile omentum can be grasped and used to compress the area. This technique is useful for sudden, significant bleeding from division of the short gastric arteries during laparoscopic fundoplication or laparoscopic splenectomy. </p><p>Dry hemostatic agents (eg, Surgicel, Gelfoam) can easily be passed through a laparoscopic port and used in conjunction with mechanical compression. Fibrin glue (with the aid of a special laparoscopic applicator) has also been used to provide hemostasis during liver biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>], splenic surgery for trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>], partial nephrectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>], and gastric bypass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. Topical hemostatic agents are discussed in detail elsewhere (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F71852\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71852 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-topical-hemostatic-agents-and-tissues-adhesives\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of topical hemostatic agents and tissues adhesives&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Once bleeding has slowed or ceased, the area is inspected to identify the bleeding point which is isolated and controlled with a clip, suture, cautery, or any of the other methods described above. The field should then be irrigated carefully with saline.

Patient factors such as advanced age or poor functional status and comorbidities (cardiopulmonary conditions, obesity, cirrhosis, clotting disorders) should be taken into account when determining whether laparoscopic attempts at hemostasis are likely to be successful and deciding how long to persist.</p><p>When moderate-to-heavy bleeding occurs, vision can be obscured when blood on the inside of the port repeatedly contacts the tip of the cleaned scope each time it is reinserted. A long cotton-tipped applicator can be used for cleaning the inside of a 5 mm port, but removal or replacement of the port may be needed. If adequate visibility cannot be maintained, conversion to an open procedure will be needed. </p><p>The decision to convert for bleeding is justifiable and prudent. An important source of patient morbidity results from the failure to convert to an open procedure in a timely fashion when bleeding is encountered. Laparoscopic hemostasis that is partially effective or ineffective can lead to significant blood loss and its associated clinical consequences. </p><p>It is important to be vigilant about the possibility of injury to local anatomic structures when attempting to control bleeding. As an example, during laparoscopic cholecystectomy, efforts to control a bleeding artery without adequate visibility can lead to application of a clip to the common bile duct or right hepatic artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].

The absence of peritoneal signs does not rule out the possibility of bowel perforation and spillage of gastrointestinal contents within the peritoneal cavity.

In a review of 21 studies of bowel injuries sustained during laparoscopic urologic surgery, the incidence of bowel injury among 14,447 cases was 0.65 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. Nearly half of the injuries were not recognized at the time of the surgery. No patient with bowel injury that was recognized intraoperatively sustained a postoperative adverse event, whereas patients with unrecognized injury and presenting in a delayed fashion required multiple procedures to manage the injury.

Injuries due to the pneumoperitoneum needle (eg, Veress) may be able to be managed conservatively. Most other trocar punctures require simple primary closure, reapproximating the bowel wall with simple sutures in one or two layers. For discrete large bowel injuries, colostomy is rarely needed. If the operating surgeon is inexperienced or uncomfortable performing such a repair, we advise consultation with a surgeon experienced with bowel surgery.

A history of prior pelvic surgery increases the risk of bladder injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Injury to the bladder is more commonly associated with primary or secondary trocar insertion, rather than related to dissection during the course of the operation. </p><p>In general, puncture of the bladder results when a midline, suprapubic trocar is placed in a patient with an overdistended bladder. In a survey of 407 obstetrician&ndash;gynecologists in Canada involving 136,997 patients, there were 8 bladder injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Four occurred with the pneumoperitoneum needle, two with the primary trocar, and two with the secondary trocar. </p><p>When anticipating port placement below the level of the umbilicus, a Foley catheter should be placed to decompress the bladder. Although it is commonplace for patients to void immediately before the procedure, it is safer to drain the bladder with a catheter after the induction of anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The catheter can also provide a means for early recognition of this complication.

The Foley catheter should be left in place for 4 to 10 days depending on the size and location of the puncture or tear.

One study evaluating the risk for late-onset hernia following a variety of open and laparoscopic surgeries reported incidences of incisional hernia at 1.9 and 3.2 percent at two and five years after laparoscopic surgery, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].

The use of port devices designed to minimize leakage of insufflated air (eg, fascial screws) also increases the incision size and may damage fascial tissue, increasing the risk for port-site hernia. Other factors include older age and higher body mass index. Increased operative times and excess tissue manipulation may also lead to fascial weakening. </p><p>With the use of trocars &le;12 mm, radially dilating trocars, or bladeless trocars, the risk of developing incisional hernia is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/78,86,87,91\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,86,87,91</a>].

At a followup of 5.9&plusmn;3.0 years, the overall extraction-site incisional hernia rate was 7.2 percent. Extraction-site hernias were most common at periumbilical midline (13 percent) and midline converted (12 percent) locations and least common at the Pfannenstiel location (0.9 percent). Besides location of the extraction site, other risk factors include obesity (hazard ratio [HR] 1.23), concurrent port-site hernia (HR 3.66), and postoperative surgical site infection (HR 2.11).

The management of the bladder injuries can range from simple catheterization to laparotomy depending upon the severity of the injury. </p><p>Ureteral injury occurs in less than 2 percent of pelvic procedures and can result from pelvic dissection during the course of distal <span class=\"nowrap\">colon/rectal,</span> gynecologic, or urologic surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/119-125\" class=\"abstract_t\">119-125</a>], or as a result of thermal injury by excessive use of an energy source adjacent the ureter. </p><p>If pelvic dissection is anticipated to be in an inflamed operative field or reoperative field, ureteral stents can be used to help identify the ureters to minimize ureteral injury; however, injury can still occur with a prophylactic stent in place. The best means of preventing inadvertent ureteral injury is identification of the ureter during the procedure using anatomic landmarks and observation of peristalsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. With complex surgeries or where anatomy is unclear, dissection and mobilization of the ureter may be needed. At the conclusion of any laparoscopic procedure in which the operative field is in the vicinity of the ureter(s), the surgeon should confirm and document the integrity of the ureters before closing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-and-management-of-indwelling-ureteral-stents#H1673162133\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement and management of indwelling ureteral stents&quot;, section on 'Prophylactic'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-epidemiology-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract injury in gynecologic surgery: Epidemiology and prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The evaluation and management of urinary tract injury is discussed in detail elsewhere.

Port site metastasis occurs after 1 to 2 percent of laparoscopic procedures performed in the presence of intraperitoneal malignancy, which is equivalent to the rate of wound metastasis after laparotomy performed under similar conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>]. Port site metastasis has been observed in as little as 10 days following laparoscopy. </p><p>Purported mechanisms include hematogenous spread or direct contamination by tumor cells, secondary effects from pneumoperitoneum (eg, immune suppression), and surgical technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/127,128\" class=\"abstract_t\">127,128</a>]. Although it is not clear whether port site metastases can be prevented, suggested measures to minimize the risk of port site metastases include the use of wound protectors and specimen extraction bags, instillation of agents to prevent tumor growth, and port-site excision. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H860571981\"><span class=\"h2\">Vulvar edema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There have been a few case reports of unilateral vulvar edema after operative laparoscopy. The mechanism is unclear, but the condition is self-limited and resolves with conservative management (ice packs, bladder catheterization, analgesia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/129,130\" class=\"abstract_t\">129,130</a>]. However, swelling in this setting can also be related to vascular bleeding and may require intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery/abstract/131\" class=\"abstract_t\">131</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H860571988\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laparoscopic techniques have revolutionized the field of surgery. Before any laparoscopic procedure can begin, the peritoneal cavity needs to be accessed to establish pneumoperitoneum and place ports for the laparoscope and various laparoscopic instruments. Most complications related to laparoscopic surgery occur during abdominal access, but other complications can occur related to abdominal insufflation and tissue dissection. The overall rate of these complications is low. (See <a href=\"#H860571890\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H860575245\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proper selection of patients, knowledge of surgical anatomy, and attention to proper abdominal access techniques may help to avoid complications. Risk factors for complications include prior <span class=\"nowrap\">surgery/abdominal</span> adhesions, excessive bowel distention, very large abdominal or pelvic masses, and diaphragmatic hernia. Patients with poor cardiopulmonary reserve may not tolerate pneumoperitoneum. For patients with risk factors for laparoscopic complications, an open surgical approach may be preferred. (See <a href=\"#H860571897\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vascular injury most commonly occurs during abdominal access and is second only to anesthesia as a cause of death from laparoscopy. The most common vascular injury overall is laceration of the inferior epigastric artery, but injury to major vascular structures can occur and are life-threatening injuries. Vascular injury may not be immediately appreciated during laparoscopy because bleeding can be retroperitoneal, rather than into the peritoneal cavity, or tamponaded by a port. When minor abdominal wall vessel injury is unrecognized, an abdominal wall hematoma may occur; most of which can be managed conservatively. When major vascular injury is identified, consultation with a surgeon experienced with vascular procedures should be obtained without delay. (See <a href=\"#H860573093\" class=\"local\">'Vascular injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Significant hemorrhage during the course of laparoscopic surgery can often be attributed to a technical error such as inadvertent cautery away from the field of dissection; excessive thermal spread of electrocautery; improper staple length, height, or stapling technique; or failure to recognize a significant vascular structure prior to its division with a nonvascular stapling instrument. As in open surgery, mechanical compression and application of topical hemostatic agents are appropriate initial strategies. Moderate bleeding during laparoscopic surgery can be controlled with clips, suture ligation, or electrosurgical methods depending upon the source of bleeding and nature of surrounding tissues. (See <a href=\"#H104329811\" class=\"local\">'Management of hemorrhage'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An important source of patient morbidity results from the failure to convert to an open procedure in a timely fashion when control of bleeding is challenging. Laparoscopic hemostasis that is partially effective or ineffective can lead to significant blood loss and its associated clinical consequences. (See <a href=\"#H104329859\" class=\"local\">'Conversion to an open procedure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injury to the bowel can relate to initial abdominal access or during the course of the operation due to electrocautery, or tissue trauma during dissection. The small bowel is the most commonly injured gastrointestinal structure during laparoscopic surgery, but stomach, liver, and colon injury can also occur. The frequency of gastrointestinal injury depends upon the nature of the procedure. Injury to the stomach can be minimized by maintaining stomach decompression with a nasogastric or orogastric tube during the procedure. Any patient who does not gradually improve or who continues to have abdominal pain following laparoscopic surgery should be evaluated for possible gastrointestinal injury. (See <a href=\"#H860571925\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injury to the bladder most commonly occurs during abdominal access rather than during the course of dissection. A history of prior pelvic surgery increases the risk of bladder injury. The risk of bladder injury can be minimized by catheterizing the patient prior to the procedure. (See <a href=\"#H860573828\" class=\"local\">'Bladder puncture'</a> above and <a href=\"#H860574082\" class=\"local\">'Urinary tract injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Port-site hernia is less common compared with incisional hernia occurring after open surgery. The risk of port-site hernia is increased with larger diameter ports (&ge;12 mm), such as those used for specimen removal, stapling devices, and single-site surgery. (See <a href=\"#H860573122\" class=\"local\">'Hernia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other complications of laparoscopic surgery include nerve injury, surgical site infection, upper urinary tract injury, and port site metastasis. (See <a href=\"#H860573114\" class=\"local\">'Nerve injury'</a> above and <a href=\"#H860573129\" class=\"local\">'Surgical site infection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H860574082\" class=\"local\">'Urinary tract injury'</a> above and <a href=\"#H860575129\" class=\"local\">'Port site metastasis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92627949\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate, Inc. would like to acknowledge Dr. Jin Yoo, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.
