The evaluation of the child or adolescent with chronic abdominal pain requires an understanding of the pathogenesis of abdominal pain, the most common causes of abdominal pain in children and adolescents, and the typical patterns of presentation.</p><p>The evaluation of the child or adolescent with chronic abdominal pain will be discussed here. The management of functional abdominal pain in children and adolescents, the causes of acute abdominal pain, and the evaluation of children with acute abdominal pain are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-management-in-primary-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional abdominal pain in children and adolescents: Management in primary care&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-acute-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of acute abdominal pain in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-evaluation-of-the-child-with-acute-abdominal-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency evaluation of the child with acute abdominal pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In this topic, we will use the term &quot;chronic abdominal pain&quot; to describe intermittent or constant abdominal pain (of functional or organic etiology) that has been present for at least two months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, in clinical practice, the distinction between acute and chronic abdominal pain is rarely distinct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Our definition is similar to that provided in the 2005 American Academy of Pediatrics and North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition clinical report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Although some clinicians require pain of three months' duration to be considered chronic, the Rome IV criteria for functional abdominal pain disorders typically require symptoms for at least two months (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71435\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71435 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The term &quot;chronic abdominal pain&quot; encompasses &quot;recurrent abdominal pain,&quot; classically defined by four criteria: 1) &ge;3 episodes of abdominal pain; 2) pain sufficiently severe to affect activities; 3) episodes occur over a period of &ge;3 months; and 4) no known organic cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In the original case series, &quot;recurrent abdominal pain of childhood&quot; was considered to be the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, clinical and laboratory evaluations suggest that recurrent abdominal pain is not a single entity but a symptom complex with both organic and functional etiologies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>]. Thus, it is more accurate to use &quot;recurrent abdominal pain&quot; as a description rather than a diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complaints of chronic abdominal pain occur in 10 to 19 percent of children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation/abstract/4,11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,11-13</a>]. The prevalence is increased in children age four to six years and early adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation/abstract/11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13</a>]. In a community-based population study, as many as 17 percent of middle and high school students reported weekly episodes of abdominal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Among the pupils who reported abdominal pain, approximately 21 percent had discomfort that was sufficiently severe to affect activity. In a 2015 meta-analysis of 58 studies including 196,472 children from around the world, the pooled prevalence of functional abdominal pain disorders was 13.5 percent (95% 11.8-15.3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain receptors in the abdomen respond to mechanical and chemical stimuli. Stretch is the principal mechanical stimulus involved in visceral pain and is induced by distension, contraction, traction, compression, and torsion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Mucosal receptors respond primarily to chemical stimuli (eg, substance P, bradykinin, serotonin, histamine, prostaglandins), which are released in response to inflammation or ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Different types of stimuli may act together to influence the perception of pain. As an example, the gastric mucosa typically is insensitive to pressure or chemical stimuli; however, these stimuli may cause pain if the gastric mucosa is inflamed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The threshold for perceiving pain from visceral stimuli varies among individuals. Pain perception is complex and involves visceral sensitivity and psychologic processing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The central nervous system's interpretation of visceral pain as serious or not serious influences the perception of pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. In children with functional abdominal pain, brain-gut communication is altered by a distortion of visceral sensation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Normal processes (eg, peristalsis) may be perceived as painful. Visceral hypersensitivity occurs through peripheral sensitization at the point of inflammation, central sensitization, and recruitment of noninvolved adjacent neurons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]; these mechanisms may predispose to chronic pain even after the initial stimulus (eg, infection) has resolved. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome&quot;, section on 'Visceral hypersensitivity'</a>.)</p><p>Sometimes pain originating in the viscera is perceived to originate at a distant site (ie, referred pain). Referred pain usually is located in the cutaneous dermatomes sharing the same spinal cord level as the visceral inputs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F61375\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61375 \">figure 1</a>). As an example, nociceptive stimuli from the gallbladder enter the spinal cord at T5 to T10. Thus, pain from an inflamed gallbladder may be perceived in the scapula. Precise localization of the pain to the right upper quadrant in patients with acute cholecystitis usually occurs once the overlying parietal peritoneum (which is somatically innervated) becomes inflamed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two broad categories of causes of chronic abdominal pain in children and adolescents are organic disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90723\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90723 \">table 2</a>) and functional abdominal pain disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71435\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71435 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Most children with chronic abdominal pain have functional abdominal pain disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation/abstract/8,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,25,26</a>]. However, the two categories are not mutually exclusive. Functional and organic conditions coexist and interact; psychologic complications of organic disease are common in children and adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. As an example, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is frequently superimposed on inflammatory bowel disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Organic disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Organic disorders are conditions that are associated with physiologic, structural, or biochemical abnormalities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90723\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90723 \">table 2</a>). Organic disorders are more likely in children with &quot;alarm&quot; findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90721\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90721 \">table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Functional disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Functional disorders are conditions in which the patient has a variable combination of symptoms without any readily identifiable or strong suspicion of an organic condition. Functional gastrointestinal pain involves interplay among regulatory factors in the enteric and central nervous systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. It may be associated with visceral hyperalgesia, reduced threshold for pain, abnormal pain referral after rectal distension, or impaired gastric relaxation response to meals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation/abstract/21,32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,32-35</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p>Several functional abdominal pain disorders of <span class=\"nowrap\">childhood/adolescence</span> have recognizable patterns of symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71435\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71435 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In a large population-based survey, the prevalences of functional abdominal pain disorders (diagnosed according to Rome III criteria) were as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal migraine &ndash; 9.2 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IBS &ndash; 2.8 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Functional abdominal <span class=\"nowrap\">pain/functional</span> abdominal pain syndrome &ndash; 1.1 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Functional dyspepsia &ndash; 0.2 percent</p><p/><p>The prevalence of functional constipation was 12.9 percent. The Rome classification does not categorize functional constipation as a functional abdominal pain disorder; however, it is a common cause of abdominal pain in children.</p><p>In most cases, functional abdominal pain is ill-defined and poorly localized or periumbilical [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Episodes of pain usually last for less than one hour, resolve spontaneously, and may be accompanied by autonomic features (eg, pallor, nausea, dizziness, headache, or fatigue) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation/abstract/27,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,38</a>]. They may be triggered or exacerbated during times of stress (eg, school transitions, parental divorce, emotional trauma). The child is well and functions normally between episodes but may have symptoms of anxiety or depression (separation anxiety, social phobias, specific phobias, generalized anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]). Alarm symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90721\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90721 \">table 3</a>) are lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation/abstract/3,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,41</a>]. The family history often is positive for gastrointestinal complaints (eg, IBS, reflux, constipation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation/abstract/14,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H279254633\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H252779776\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial evaluation of the child or adolescent with chronic abdominal pain includes history, physical examination, and stool testing for occult blood to determine whether the child has any &quot;alarm findings&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90721\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90721 \">table 3</a>), which help to distinguish organic from functional abdominal pain and direct the need for additional evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation/abstract/3,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,41,42</a>]. In an observational study, weight loss, hematochezia, and anemia were more common in children with Crohn disease than with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), with a cumulative sensitivity of 94 percent. The specifics of the additional evaluation depend upon the diagnostic considerations. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Patients with alarm findings'</a> below.)</p><p>Information other than alarm findings obtained in the initial evaluation helps to distinguish among organic etiologies and provides insight into biopsychosocial factors that may trigger or reinforce pain (independent of etiology) and are helpful formulating a management plan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation/abstract/31,43-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,43-47</a>].

At the time of presentation, the parents and child may be frustrated and anxious; they may have tried over-the-counter or dietary interventions without improvement and may be increasingly concerned that the child has a serious disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The parents should be asked what they think is causing the pain (or what they are worried is causing the pain) so that their concerns can be directly addressed. It is important to establish a therapeutic alliance early in the course of evaluation and treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-management-in-primary-care#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional abdominal pain in children and adolescents: Management in primary care&quot;, section on 'Therapeutic relationship'</a>.)</p><p>It may be helpful to introduce the concept and high likelihood of FGIDs as a possible cause at the initial evaluation, even if the pain has not been present long enough to qualify as &quot;chronic&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation/abstract/2,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,48</a>]. It also may be helpful to educate the <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/family</span> about the biopsychosocial model of pain and possible role of stress (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90722\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90722 \">figure 2</a>). Providing examples of how stress can directly cause abdominal pain or other symptoms (ie, churning of the stomach or headache before a test) may help them to understand this relationship.</p><p>The patient and family should be assured that the clinician will search for identifiable causes, initiate a treatment plan, and continue to follow the patient on a regular basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Periodic follow-up validates the clinician's continued support and interest in the <span class=\"nowrap\">child/adolescent</span> and family.

It must assess possible organic causes for the pain, as well as biologic and psychosocial factors that may be contributing to it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation/abstract/31,43-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,43-46</a>].</p><p>It is important to ask specifically about alarm findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90721\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90721 \">table 3</a>). In a 2005 systematic review, alarm findings were helpful in distinguishing organic from functional pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.) Alarm findings from the history include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Involuntary weight loss or unexplained fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Difficulty swallowing or painful swallowing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomiting that is bilious, protracted, projectile, or otherwise worrisome</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea that is severe and chronic (&ge;3 loose or watery stools per day for &ge;2 weeks), nocturnal, or bloody</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinary symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Back pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), celiac disease, or peptic ulcer disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin changes (eg, rash, eczema, hives)</p><p/><p>Although they may not be helpful in distinguishing organic from functional causes of pain, other aspects of the history may help to distinguish among organic causes or provide insight into exacerbating factors and how the pain affects the <span class=\"nowrap\">child/family</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58194\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58194 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Asking the patient to record a pain diary for one week can help to clarify the details of the pain history and possible areas of intervention.

The relationship between menstrual periods and the pain should be elicited.</p><p/><p>The psychosocial history is an important part of the evaluation of children and adolescents with chronic abdominal pain. Psychosocial factors do not help to distinguish organic from functional abdominal pain but may contribute to the perception or maintenance of abdominal pain, regardless of the etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation/abstract/31,43-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,43-46</a>]. In some children abdominal pain may be reinforced by parental attention or being allowed to stay home from school. Abdominal pain also may be a physiologic response to traumatic events (eg, physical or sexual abuse) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation/abstract/50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52</a>].
