Although the concept of a platelet growth factor analogous to erythropoietin had been proposed in the 1950s, it was not until 1994 that the existence of this hematopoietic growth factor was demonstrated and the protein purified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. Although historically called &quot;thrombopoietin&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], its discoverers also called it by several other names, including megapoietin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], megakaryocyte growth and development factor (MGDF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], and c-Mpl ligand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The last name is often used instead of TPO because the receptor for TPO, called c-Mpl, was discovered prior to the identification of TPO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] and was instrumental in helping to purify the ligand (ie, the c-Mpl ligand) that bound to it.</p><p>This topic will review the biology and physiology of TPO. The potential clinical applications of TPO, ranging from the management of thrombocytopenic states to improving yields from platelet apheresis, are discussed separately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-applications-of-thrombopoietic-growth-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical applications of thrombopoietic growth factors&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">STRUCTURE OF THROMBOPOIETIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TPO is produced primarily in liver parenchymal cells with much smaller amounts being made in the kidney and bone marrow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. It is synthesized as a 353 amino acid precursor protein with a molecular weight of 36 kDa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/2,4,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,11</a>]. Following the removal of the 21 amino acid signal peptide, the remaining 332 amino acids undergo glycosylation to produce a 95 kDa glycoprotein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F62134\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62134 \">figure 1</a>). The glycoprotein is then released into the circulation with no apparent intracellular storage in the liver or kidney.</p><p>TPO is an unusual hematopoietic growth factor in a number of ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is much larger than most other regulators of blood cell production such as G-CSF (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) and erythropoietin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It has an unusual structure in that the first 153 amino acids of the mature protein are 23 percent homologous with human erythropoietin&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F62134\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62134 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] and probably 50 percent similar if conservative amino acid substitutions are considered. This region also contains four cysteine residues just like those in erythropoietin and is highly conserved among different species. Despite these similarities, TPO does not bind the erythropoietin receptor and erythropoietin does not bind the TPO receptor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amino acids 154 to 332 comprise a novel sequence that contains six-N-linked glycosylation sites and is less well conserved among different species. Structure-function studies have demonstrated that the first 153 amino acids of the c-Mpl ligand are all that is required for its thrombopoietic effect in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]; however, this truncated molecule has a markedly decreased circulatory half-life compared with the 20 to 40 hour half-life of the native protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Presumably, the glycosylated second half of the molecule confers stability and prolongs the circulatory half-life. Similar carbohydrate sequences regulate the stability of erythropoietin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p>The crystal structure of TPO has been determined and reveals an antiparallel four-helix bundle fold with two different binding sites for the TPO receptor. One has a binding constant for the TPO receptor of 3.3 x 10<sup>-9</sup> M and the other 1.1 x 10<sup>-6</sup> M [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">THROMBOPOIETIN GENE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a single copy of the gene for TPO on human chromosome 3q27-28 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/11,12,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,16</a>]. The gene spans approximately 7 kb with seven exons, the first two of which are noncoding. The third exon contains part of the 5'-untranslated sequence and part of the signal peptide. The erythropoietin-like region is coded for by exons 4 to 7 and all of the carbohydrate domain is encoded by exon 7.</p><p>Comparison with the erythropoietin gene shows conservation of the boundaries of the coding exons except for the addition of the carbohydrate domain sequence in the final exon of the TPO gene. In addition to the functional mRNA encoded (TPO-1), two other nonfunctional mRNA sequences (TPO-2 and TPO-3) are present due to alternative splicing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">THROMBOPOIETIN RECEPTOR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TPO acts through the TPO receptor, called c-Mpl. Prior to the identification of thrombopoietin, a murine myeloproliferative leukemia virus was identified that contained a retroviral oncogene, <strong>v-Mpl</strong> (ie, <strong>m</strong>yelo<strong>p</strong>roliferative <strong>l</strong>eukemia); this oncogene encoded the cytoplasmic portion of a membrane protein which had all the characteristics of a new hematopoietic growth factor receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>When the full-length homolog (<strong>c-Mpl</strong>) was cloned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], its mRNA was found to be present at significant levels primarily in platelets and megakaryocytes and in a small percentage of CD34+ cells (which are early hematopoietic precursors) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The identification of c-Mpl as the putative thrombopoietin receptor was further strengthened by the demonstration that the formation of megakaryocyte (Meg-CFC), but not myeloid (GM-CFC) or erythroid (E-BFU), precursors in bone marrow culture was decreased when synthesis of the c-Mpl protein was inhibited by the addition of c-Mpl antisense constructs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>It is now known that the thrombopoietin receptor (c-Mpl) is present on platelets and megakaryocytes and, at a lesser density, on most other hematopoietic precursor cells. Studies with human platelets indicate the presence of approximately 56 &plusmn; 17 receptors per human platelet with an affinity of 163 &plusmn; 31 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Upon binding to thrombopoietin, the receptor undergoes dimerization that results in a number of signal transduction events that prevent apoptosis, improve cell viability, promote growth, and possibly increase differentiation in megakaryocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In addition, binding to the receptor provides the major mechanism by which thrombopoietin is removed from the circulation by platelets and possibly megakaryocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/3,22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,22-25</a>]. After thrombopoietin binding to platelets, the receptor-ligand complex undergoes internalization and the bound thrombopoietin is degraded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/20,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,26</a>]. The receptor is not re-expressed on the platelet surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGY OF THROMBOPOIETIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Much has been learned about the normal physiology of thrombopoietin, its effects upon bone marrow precursor cells, megakaryocytes, and platelets, as well as regulation of its concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Effects on platelet production</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thrombopoietin is the only physiologically relevant regulator of platelet production; it acts to &quot;amplify&quot; the basal production rate of megakaryocytes and platelets. When thrombopoietin or its receptor have been &quot;knocked-out&quot; by homologous recombination in mice, the megakaryocyte and platelet mass are reduced to approximately 10 percent of normal, but the animals are healthy and do not spontaneously bleed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F68869\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68869 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. The neutrophil and erythrocyte counts are normal. In animals in which only one of the thrombopoietin genes has been deleted, the platelet count is reduced to approximately 65 percent of normal. Such thrombopoietin-deficient mice can increase their platelet count if treated with other thrombopoietic growth factors such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-11, and stem cell factor (c-kit ligand) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. However, neither endogenous IL-6 nor endogenous IL-11 appears to be responsible for the residual platelet production in these animals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Binding of thrombopoietin to its receptor prevents apoptosis of megakaryocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>] and increases their number, size, and ploidy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Megakaryocyte biology and the production of platelets&quot;</a>.) The rate of cellular maturation is probably also increased. These events are mediated via signal transduction pathways involving JAK, STAT, and other intracellular mediators (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F74891\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74891 \">figure 3</a>). Furthermore, the addition of thrombopoietin to CD34+ cells in culture results in the majority of cells becoming megakaryocytes and then shedding platelets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. This last step, the shedding of platelets from megakaryocytes, does not require, and actually may be inhibited by, the presence of thrombopoietin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>A predictable response occurs after the daily administration of a recombinant form of thrombopoietin to normal baboons (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F59564%7EHEME%2F72350\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59564 graphicRef72350 \">figure 4A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. During the first four days of administration, bone marrow megakaryocyte ploidy rises to a maximum but there is no change in the platelet count. On day five, the platelet count begins to rise and does so at a dose-dependent rate. With continued administration of thrombopoietin, a dose-dependent plateau platelet count is attained on days 8 to 12. There is a log-linear relationship between the thrombopoietin dose and the plateau platelet count with the maximum response being a sixfold increase in the rate of platelet production. Upon stopping the thrombopoietin, the platelet count returns to its baseline over 10 days without a rebound thrombocytopenia.</p><p>A similar time course and platelet response have been demonstrated after thrombopoietin administration to humans with no apparent toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-applications-of-thrombopoietic-growth-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical applications of thrombopoietic growth factors&quot;</a>.) There is no effect on red or white blood cells.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Effects on platelet function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to increasing the number of megakaryocytes and platelets, thrombopoietin can also affect the function of platelets. When thrombopoietin binds to its platelet receptor, it induces phosphorylation of the c-Mpl receptor and a number of other molecules in several different signal transduction pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]. Although thrombopoietin does not cause platelet activation directly, it reduces the threshold for activation by other platelet agonists such as ADP and collagen by 50 percent. It is unclear if this is a clinically relevant effect posing a risk for thrombosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-applications-of-thrombopoietic-growth-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical applications of thrombopoietic growth factors&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Effects on bone marrow precursor cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although thrombopoietin affects late cellular maturation events only in megakaryocytes, it and its receptor (c-Mpl) appear to play an important role in the regulation of the growth of early precursors of other lineages and even of the pluripotential stem cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/46-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-49</a>]. Most evidence suggests that binding of thrombopoietin to c-Mpl enhances the survival and proliferation of already committed precursor cells, rather than a true stimulation of differentiation from stem cells. Homozygous knock-in mice, in which the gene for c-Mpl was replaced by a gene for a chimeric molecule consisting of the extracellular domain of c-Mpl and the cytoplasmic domain of the G-CSF receptor, have a normal platelet count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Since the intracellular domain of the G-CSF receptor can functionally replace the signaling activity of c-Mpl, this result suggests that thrombopoietin primarily affects cells already committed to the megakaryocyte lineage.</p><p>When administered to normal animals, thrombopoietin increases bone marrow and peripheral blood megakaryocyte precursor cells (Meg-CFC), bone marrow megakaryocytes, and the platelet count. In addition, both erythroid and multipotential precursor cells are increased in the bone marrow and peripheral blood but without affecting the erythrocyte or neutrophil count.</p><p>In animals made deficient in thrombopoietin or its receptor (c-Mpl), Meg-CFC are reduced by 90 to 95 percent as expected, and myeloid and erythroid precursor cells are reduced by 60 to 80 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F79858\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79858 \">figure 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/30,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,33</a>]. The normal neutrophil and erythrocyte counts in these animals are presumably maintained by intact feedback mechanisms mediated by G-CSF and erythropoietin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Regulation of circulating levels</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatic thrombopoietin production is constitutive; circulating levels are determined by the circulating platelet mass (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F78686\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78686 \">figure 6</a>). In contrast to the production of red blood cells, which is regulated by a system that senses hypoxia and alters the rate of transcription of the erythropoietin gene, there is no such &quot;sensor&quot; of the platelet mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/3,22-24,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,22-24,51</a>].

There is no evidence for post-transcriptional regulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>The constitutive nature of TPO production has been challenged by studies in mice in which the Ashwell-Morell receptor (AMR) on hepatocytes has been shown to bind platelets that have lost sialic acids on their surface. Once bound by the AMR, a JAK-STAT signaling pathway is activated that increases hepatic TPO mRNA and TPO production in this model system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

Potential concerns regarding this model include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If removal of platelets by the AMR increases TPO production, then in patients with severe thrombocytopenia (eg, as in aplastic anemia [AA]), TPO production (and TPO levels) should be low, whereas in fact they are markedly elevated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In situations of increased platelet removal (eg, as in immune thrombocytopenia [ITP]), the AMR pathway should lead to increased TPO production (and TPO levels), whereas in fact TPO levels are normal or low.</p><p/><p>A combination of constitutive TPO production and AMR-mediated platelet increases may occur in some settings; more research regarding this possibility is awaited.</p><p>Once TPO is produced, circulating TPO levels are regulated by the volume of the total platelet mass. Platelets and megakaryocytes contain high affinity TPO (c-Mpl) receptors that bind and clear TPO from the circulation, directly determining the circulating TPO concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Evidence for this includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When platelet production is decreased, as in thrombocytopenia due to megakaryocytic hypoplasia, clearance of TPO is reduced and levels rise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/20,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plasma TPO concentrations fall after platelet transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p/><p>This sort of feedback system is not unusual in hematology. As an example, both M-CSF and G-CSF are normally regulated primarily by the amount of circulating monocytes and neutrophils, respectively. It seems as if only erythropoietin has a true sensor of the circulating blood cell mass that in turn alters production of this hematopoietic growth factor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">DISORDERS OF THROMBOPOIETIN AND ITS RECEPTOR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Understanding of the physiology of TPO has led to consideration of a number of possible clinical disorders ranging from excess TPO production to decreased expression of the TPO receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].
