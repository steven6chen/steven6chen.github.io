Cardiac malformations are a major component of heterotaxy syndrome and are associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Abnormal cardiac development typically leads to atrial appendage isomerism, resulting in either bilateral paired right atria (right atrial isomerism) or paired left atria (left atrial isomerism).</p><p>This topic will review the management and outcome of patients with heterotaxy (isomerism). The anatomical variation, clinical features, and diagnosis of heterotaxy (isomerism) are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heterotaxy-isomerism-of-the-atrial-appendages-anatomy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Heterotaxy (isomerism of the atrial appendages): Anatomy, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H440348485\"><span class=\"h1\">BACKGROUND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with heterotaxy, the normal asymmetry of the thoracic and abdominal organs is lost, resulting in an unusual degree of symmetry of organs and veins. The term &quot;isomerism,&quot; derived from Greek (<em>iso,</em> meaning &quot;equal,&quot; and <em>meros</em>, meaning &quot;part&quot;), refers to this abnormal developmental symmetry in which morphologic structures that normally develop on one side or the other of the body are found on both sides of the body, and is the currently accepted term used to describe hearts with isomeric atria and atrial appendages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heterotaxy-isomerism-of-the-atrial-appendages-management-and-outcome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. So, in affected patients, instead of a distinct left and right side, individuals with isomerism will have either two right sides or two left sides resulting in either two right atria or two left atria (atrial isomerism) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heterotaxy-isomerism-of-the-atrial-appendages-management-and-outcome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Atrial isomerism is a major component of heterotaxy and causes significant morbidity and mortality because of discordance among the heart, systemic and pulmonary vessels, and other organs, and also among components of the heart.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H440348576\"><span class=\"h2\">Atrial isomerism</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H440348557\"><span class=\"h3\">Right atrial appendage isomerism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Right atrial appendage isomerism, also referred to as right atrial isomerism (RAI), results in two right sides with bilateral right atria and atrial appendages and an absence of left-sided structures (eg, coronary sinus). These patients usually have pulmonary venous anomalies, such as anomalous pulmonary venous connections or small pulmonary veins. Single ventricle physiology is predominant in RAI, as patients usually have a hypoplastic left ventricle. These patients also typically have asplenia, as the spleen is a left-side abdominal organ. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heterotaxy-isomerism-of-the-atrial-appendages-anatomy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H309390928\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Heterotaxy (isomerism of the atrial appendages): Anatomy, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Right atrial isomerism'</a>.)</p><p>In general, patients with RAI most often present during the neonatal period with cyanosis due to right-to-left shunting as a result of pulmonary outflow obstruction and septal defects between the atria and ventricles. In severely affected neonates, survival is dependent on maintaining a patent ductus arteriosus. In other cases, respiratory distress may develop because of pulmonary congestion due to pulmonary venous obstruction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H440348563\"><span class=\"h3\">Left atrial appendage isomerism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Left atrial appendage isomerism, also referred to as left atrial isomerism (LAI), results in two left sides with bilateral left atria and atrial appendages. In these cases, systemic venous abnormalities, such as interruption of the inferior vena cava, are common. The cardiac anatomy is more variable in LAI than in RAI. Polysplenia also occurs more often, as left-sided organs are more frequently duplicated in patients with left atrial isomerism. Patients with LAI are more likely to have arrhythmias because of the absence of a sinus node, which is located in the right atrium, and complete heart block.

Because cardiac lesions are the predominant cause of mortality and morbidity, neonates should be cared for at a tertiary medical center with experience in managing complex congenital heart disease. When an antenatal diagnosis is made, maternal transfer should be performed so that neonatal care can be given immediately after birth.</p><p>Tailoring of therapy, both medical and surgical, depends on the specific anatomy of both cardiac and noncardiac defects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H288083086\"><span class=\"h1\">CARDIAC MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiac management is dependent on the severity of the cardiac lesions. It includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial medical management to maintain adequate tissue perfusion and oxygenation in patients</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subsequent management focused on palliative and corrective surgical procedures based on ventricular physiology (ie, single versus biventricular function)</p><p/><p>Those with right atrial isomerism (RAI) usually have more severe heart defects, often precluding them from a biventricular repair and necessitating neonatal palliative interventions leading to the single ventricle pathway. As the lesions in left atrial isomerism (LAI) are often less severe, biventricular repair is more often attained.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H288083092\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiac medical management is focused on stabilization of cardiac and pulmonary function ensuring adequate pulmonary blood flow and systemic oxygenation in severely affected neonates. In addition, patients with LAI are at risk for complete heart block and sinus node dysfunction.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary arterial outflow obstruction and cyanosis &ndash; Patients with RAI typically have right-to-left shunting due to pulmonary outflow obstruction, which rarely occurs in LAI. In severely affected neonates, there is inadequate pulmonary blood flow and survival is dependent on maintaining a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) to ensure adequate pulmonary blood flow. In these patients, administration of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1, also known as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alprostadil-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">alprostadil</a>) is needed to ensure pulmonary blood flow until a definitive pulmonary blood supply is attained, either by surgery or interventional catheterization techniques.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In cases that are also accompanied by obstructed pulmonary venous return resulting in severe hypoxemia and metabolic acidosis, PGE1 is usually unhelpful. Maintaining patency may in fact be detrimental in neonates who have already undergone the physiologic decline in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) by causing an increase in pulmonary edema due to pulmonary venous obstruction in the face of increased flow to the lungs through the PDA. In contrast, a patent ductus may provide a pop-off for pulmonary blood flow in neonates who continue to have a high PVR, resulting in increasing cyanosis due to the right-to-left shunting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heterotaxy-isomerism-of-the-atrial-appendages-management-and-outcome/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. In these settings, standard intensive care stabilization techniques are employed, and surgery should be performed as soon as possible.

In these patients, medical management includes supportive nonpharmacologic intervention (eg, oxygen administration, positive pressure support, and mechanical ventilation), and pharmacologic therapy (eg, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, inotropic therapy, and loop diuretic). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-in-children-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Heart failure in children: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete atrioventricular block and sinus node dysfunction &ndash; Patients with LAI are at risk for complete atrioventricular (AV) block causing ventricular bradycardia. In one case series, 40 of 116 fetal cases of AV block were associated with LAI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heterotaxy-isomerism-of-the-atrial-appendages-management-and-outcome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The principal therapeutic decision after the immediate perinatal period is whether a pacemaker should be inserted. In addition, because of the increased risk of sinus node dysfunction, some experts in the field have proposed prophylactic pacemaker placement in the adult with LAI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heterotaxy-isomerism-of-the-atrial-appendages-management-and-outcome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Although primary repair is preferred, in cases in which a two-ventricle repair is not feasible (eg, one of the ventricles is hypoplastic), surgical palliation is performed using interventions developed for other single ventricular morphologic conditions, such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome.</p><p>In general, biventricular repair is not suitable for patients with RAI, as they usually have single ventricle morphology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heterotaxy-isomerism-of-the-atrial-appendages-management-and-outcome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Although biventricular repair is more likely in patients with LAI, single ventricle palliation still appears to be more appropriate in at least 50 to 70 percent of LAI cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H445071254\"><span class=\"h3\">Single ventricle palliation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Similar to other univentricular conditions, palliative management beginning in the neonate generally consists of a series of staged procedures, which vary with the underlying lesions. These procedures are discussed in greater detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome#H1069697698\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypoplastic left heart syndrome: Management and outcome&quot;, section on 'Surgical management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H445071275\"><span class=\"h4\">Right atrial isomerism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following steps are the typical staged palliative approach in the management of patients with RAI:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because patients with RAI generally have pulmonary outflow obstruction, the initial palliative procedure is usually a systemic-pulmonary shunt that provides a reliable conduit for pulmonary blood flow. Risk factors for mortality include the need for an initial palliation at a younger age and the presence of total anomalous venous return, especially if there is obstruction to the anomalous venous connection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heterotaxy-isomerism-of-the-atrial-appendages-management-and-outcome/abstract/3,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The second procedure is bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis. This procedure is generally performed soon after the initial palliative procedure, since most patients with RAI have significant regurgitation through a malformed AV valve, which is often worsened by placement of the initial palliative systemic-pulmonary shunt. The presence of anomalous pulmonary venous connection has not been shown to be a risk factor for morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heterotaxy-isomerism-of-the-atrial-appendages-management-and-outcome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The final stage is completion of the Fontan operation. Although this procedure is similar to that performed in other patients with single ventricle anatomy, reports have shown a higher mortality and morbidity rate for patients with RAI compared with patients with nonisometric single ventricle physiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heterotaxy-isomerism-of-the-atrial-appendages-management-and-outcome/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. The increased risk of poor outcome was thought to be due to the presence of a common AV valve, right ventricular morphology, and anomalous venous connections. In a subsequent case series of patients undergoing Fontan procedure from 1996 to 2005, survival and reoperation rates for patients with heterotaxy substantially improved, approaching similar rates to patients without heterotaxy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heterotaxy-isomerism-of-the-atrial-appendages-management-and-outcome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The improved outcome was attributed to superior surgical techniques utilizing extracardiac conduits and creating baffle fenestrations, and improved postsurgical intensive care. However, patients with heterotaxy still had an increased risk of post-Fontan arrhythmias and AV valve regurgitation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a multicenter cross-section study of 546 survivors of the Fontan procedure, patients with heterotaxy (n = 42) compared with patients without isomerism were more likely to undergo Fontan procedure at a later age (median age 3.9 versus 2.8 years), have previous pulmonary vein surgery (21 versus 0.4 percent), have atrial arrhythmia post-Fontan (19 versus 8 percent), and have a greater degree of AV valve regurgitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heterotaxy-isomerism-of-the-atrial-appendages-management-and-outcome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H445071588\"><span class=\"h4\">Left atrial isomerism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, 50 to 70 percent of patients will LAI undergo single ventricle palliation. The following are the typical steps in the staged palliative management of patients with LAI:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial palliative step for LAI can include any of the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A systemic-pulmonary shunt (for pulmonary blood flow obstruction).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A Norwood-type procedure for obstructive left-sided lesions that result in left ventricular hypoplasia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome#H4000523369\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypoplastic left heart syndrome: Management and outcome&quot;, section on 'Norwood procedure'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Banding of the main pulmonary artery in those with single ventricle physiology and unobstructed pulmonary blood flow is needed. If the pulmonary bed is left unprotected (unbanded), early cardiac failure will ensue in any infant with a large left-to-right shunt with severe pulmonary overcirculation, which will cause systemic hypoperfusion resulting in metabolic acidosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because many patients with LAI have an interrupted inferior vena cava with azygos continuation, the second stage of palliation of a total cavopulmonary shunt is often a unique procedure (Kawashima procedure) from that performed in patients with other forms of univentricular physiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heterotaxy-isomerism-of-the-atrial-appendages-management-and-outcome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. It entails end-to-side anastomosis between the superior vena cava and the confluent pulmonary artery, division or ligation of the pulmonary artery trunk to eliminate competitive antegrade pulmonary flow, and repair of the common AV valve when regurgitation is present. As a result, all the venous return, apart from the hepatic veins that drain directly into the atria, will flow to the pulmonary bed. Although the Kawashima operation was initially thought to be the final palliative procedure needed for patients with LAI, patients subsequently developed progressive oxygen desaturation due to pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. Thus, it is prudent to follow patients who have undergone a Kawashima procedure closely for the development of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations both by pulse oximetry and by contrast echocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heterotaxy-isomerism-of-the-atrial-appendages-management-and-outcome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who develop significant pulmonary arteriovenous malformations resulting in severe cyanosis, redirection of the hepatic venous return (Fontan completion) to the pulmonary circulation results in regression of the pulmonary arteriovenous malformations and a concomitant improvement in oxygen saturation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heterotaxy-isomerism-of-the-atrial-appendages-management-and-outcome/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. It appears that at least one-half or more of patients with LAI will require hepatic vein redirection following Kawashima procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heterotaxy-isomerism-of-the-atrial-appendages-management-and-outcome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H445071594\"><span class=\"h3\">Biventricular repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biventricular repair in patients with heterotaxy is primarily performed in patients with LAI. In general, 40 to 50 percent of patients with LAI have two good-sized ventricles with concordant ventriculoarterial connection and normal outflow tracts and are amenable to biventricular repair. Repair typically encompasses septation of a common AV valve, ventricular septal defect closure, and mitral valve cleft repair along with appropriate baffling of anomalous systemic or pulmonary venous return. A frequent cause of reoperation following biventricular repair is progressive AV valvar regurgitation of the left-sided AV valve. Recurrent subaortic stenosis has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heterotaxy-isomerism-of-the-atrial-appendages-management-and-outcome/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].</p><p>Biventricular repair is uncommon in patients with RAI, as most of these patients do not have two adequate-sized ventricles. Patients with RAI who undergo biventricular repair have similar long-term morbidities (such as arrhythmias) to those with a palliative Fontan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heterotaxy-isomerism-of-the-atrial-appendages-management-and-outcome/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. In addition to the general risk factors for mortality in those with LAI (biliary atresia, low birth weight, complete AV block, coarctation of the aorta), single ventricle physiology has been shown to be an independent risk factor.</p><p>The relative frequency of biventricular repair for RAI and LAI was illustrated in a large case series of 371 patients with heterotaxy cared for in a tertiary center in the United States between 1990 and 2007 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heterotaxy-isomerism-of-the-atrial-appendages-management-and-outcome/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

If a malrotation with a volvulus is detected, surgical repair should be initiated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intestinal-malrotation-in-children#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intestinal malrotation in children&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p>In asymptomatic patients, it is unclear whether the benefits of prophylactic surgery outweigh the risks of the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heterotaxy-isomerism-of-the-atrial-appendages-management-and-outcome/abstract/33-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-41</a>]. In our practice, we screen patients for malrotation and manage asymptomatic patients conservatively. We do not perform prophylactic surgery in asymptomatic patients because of the high risk of complications in patients with heterotaxy and because the benefit of preemptive surgery in asymptomatic patients has not been established.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H445072513\"><span class=\"h2\">Biliary atresia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neonates with heterotaxy, especially those with left atrial isomerism and jaundice, need to be evaluated for biliary atresia. If the diagnosis of biliary atresia is confirmed, a Kasai procedure (hepatoportoenterostomy) should be performed promptly.

It should be conducted in a center with expertise in congenital heart disease, and it is imperative for clinicians caring for these patients to know the risk and management of issues following either palliative interventions or biventricular repair. For patients undergoing palliation, the care is based on the clinical status of the patient following each intervention.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3277750\"><span class=\"h2\">Palliative interventions: Follow-up and timing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Follow-up care is dependent on the stage of palliation and the clinical status of the patient.

At each visit, the clinical status is evaluated with a focus on the adequacy of oxygen saturation and somatic growth. As many of these single ventricle patients have ventricular overload and abnormal atrioventricular (AV) valves, surveillance echocardiograms are performed on a monthly basis to monitor for the development of AV insufficiency.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis is typically performed at three to four months as the patient begins to outgrow his or her original shunt, and becomes progressively more cyanotic. Prior to bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis, a cardiac catheterization is performed to assess for suitability for passive pulmonary blood flow.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, if there is interruption of the inferior vena cava with azygos continuation (typically seen in left atrial isomerism [LAI] cases), we delay performing this procedure because in these patients, connection of the superior vena cava means that all the systemic venous return except for the hepatic veins drains directly into an atrium and will be rerouted passively to the pulmonary arteries. As this might not be accommodated easily at three to four months, we usually wait until eight to nine months of age to perform this procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once a more stable circulation is obtained following the bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis, follow-up care may be performed at three to four intervals until the third stage of palliation (total cavopulmonary anastomosis [ie, Fontan completion]) occurs. A cardiac catheterization is also performed prior to the Fontan completion to assess hemodynamic suitability and to see whether any interventions such as occlusion of collaterals or stenting of pulmonary arteries are needed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The decision of when to perform a Fontan completion varies among institutions but can be performed as early as two years of age. Fontan completion is typically performed when patients begin to outgrow (ie, become more cyanotic) their bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following a Fontan completion, patients need monitoring for conduction defects and arrhythmias.

Cardiac malformations are a major component of heterotaxy syndrome and are associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Affected patients do not have the normal asymmetry of distinctive right and left sides, but will have one of the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Right atrial appendage isomerism, also referred to as right atrial isomerism (RAI), results in two right atria and atrial appendages, and absence of left-sided structures. Patients generally have a univentricular physiology, pulmonary arterial outflow obstruction, pulmonary venous anomalies, atrioventricular canal defect, and asplenia. (See <a href=\"#H440348557\" class=\"local\">'Right atrial appendage isomerism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Left atrial appendage isomerism, also referred to as left atrial isomerism (LAI), results in two bilateral left atria and atrial appendages. These patients typically will have interrupted inferior vena cava, polysplenia, an increased risk of atrial arrhythmias, and complete heart block. In addition, 10 percent of patients with LAI will have biliary atresia. (See <a href=\"#H440348563\" class=\"local\">'Left atrial appendage isomerism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of patients with atrial isomerism is challenging given the wide spectrum of both cardiac and noncardiac anatomical anomalies. Because cardiac lesions are the predominant cause of mortality and morbidity, neonates should be cared for at a tertiary medical center with experience in managing complex congenital heart disease (CHD). When an antenatal diagnosis is made, maternal transfer should be performed so that neonatal care can be given immediately after birth. (See <a href=\"#H445071134\" class=\"local\">'Management overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac management is dependent on the severity of the cardiac lesions.

Although primary repair is preferred, in cases in which a two-ventricle repair is not feasible (eg, one of the ventricles is hypoplastic), staged surgical palliation is performed using interventions developed for other single ventricular morphologic conditions, such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome.
