It should provide an adequate basal insulin dose and doses of a very short-acting insulin that are related to the patient's carbohydrate intake and the premeal glucose values.</p><p>However, it does not work. The patient now has satisfactory glucose control on some days and increased variability on other days, when he experiences both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia.</p><p>What is your next action?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You advise the patient to measure the blood glucose levels seven or eight times a day, both before and after meals and at 2 or 3 AM, to guide further adjustments in insulin therapy.
