It is estimated that between 4 and 13 percent of mechanically ventilated patients require PMV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-patients-requiring-prolonged-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>], resulting in between 7250 and 11,400 patients undergoing PMV at any one time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-patients-requiring-prolonged-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. PMV is associated with increased health care cost, morbidity, and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-patients-requiring-prolonged-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Issues related to PMV are reviewed here, including predictors, weaning, complications, and outcomes.

Studies have sought to identify such predictors, but their results are difficult to generalize because they examined varying durations of mechanical ventilation and specific patient populations. In addition, attempts to validate potential predictors have found poor sensitivity and specificity.</p><p>One of the few studies examining general medical and surgical intensive care unit (ICU) patients prospectively followed 5915 patients that required mechanical ventilation on the first day of their ICU admission. The relative contribution of various patient- and disease-related variables to the duration of mechanical ventilation was identified. The following variables were reported as being associated with an increased duration of mechanical ventilation, with their relative contribution shown in parentheses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-patients-requiring-prolonged-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ICU admission due to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), neuromuscular disease, head trauma, or postoperative intracerebral hemorrhage (44.3 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated Acute Physiology Score (APS) of the Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation III (APACHE III) on the first day in the ICU (25 percent).

The patients with confirmed CIP required mechanical ventilation for a longer duration than patients without CIP (median of 34 versus 14 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-patients-requiring-prolonged-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The relationship between CIP and duration of mechanical ventilation persisted after adjustment for potential confounders (odds ratio 15.5, 95% CI, 4.55-52.3). </p><p>It is likely that peripheral weakness also predicts the duration of mechanical ventilation because it is a marker of respiratory muscle weakness. In an observational study of 116 patients who were mechanically ventilated for seven days or more, the Medical Research Council (MRC) muscle strength score correlated with the maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) and vital capacity (VC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-patients-requiring-prolonged-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Seventeen patients failed the spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and returned to mechanical ventilation while 14 patients tolerated the trial and were successfully extubated.

When approaching these decisions, we meet with the patient to review their current medical status, the likelihood of eventual weaning, and expected quality and duration of life should they remain ventilator dependent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-patients-requiring-prolonged-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

In a randomized trial specific to patients with PMV, patients who received unassisted breathing trials through a tracheostomy collar had a shorter median time to ventilator liberation (15 days [interquartile range (IQR) 8 to 25 days] versus 19 days [IQR 12 to 31 days]), although 6-month and 12-month mortality did not differ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-patients-requiring-prolonged-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. This trial was conducted in a single long-term weaning facility, and further studies at other institutions are needed to determine the generalizability of these findings.</p><p>Several studies suggest that protocols that stress frequent reassessment have a greater impact on weaning than the method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-patients-requiring-prolonged-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/1,43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,43,44</a>]. As an example, an observational study evaluated 252 patients requiring PMV who were weaned via a respiratory therapist-driven protocol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-patients-requiring-prolonged-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The protocol advanced patients directly to a one hour spontaneous breathing trial if the rapid shallow breathing index (frequency to tidal volume ratio) was less than 80. Protocol-guided weaning was associated with a shorter median duration of mechanical ventilation compared to historical controls (17 versus 29 days). This suggests that use of a standardized protocol may be more important than the weaning strategy itself. The same investigators later found that a rapid shallow breathing index less than 97 was the most accurate predictor of a successful spontaneous breathing trial in patients with PMV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-patients-requiring-prolonged-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-the-rapid-shallow-breathing-index\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Weaning from mechanical ventilation: The rapid shallow breathing index&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In our clinical practice, once patients can tolerate spontaneous breathing trials, we gradually increase the duration of the daily spontaneous breathing trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-patients-requiring-prolonged-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Criteria used to assess patient tolerance during spontaneous breathing include the respiratory pattern, adequacy of gas exchange, hemodynamic stability, and subjective comfort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-patients-requiring-prolonged-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Patients who fail spontaneous breathing should be placed on a non-fatiguing, comfortable mode of ventilation and the cause of failure determined and corrected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients receiving PMV suffer similar complications as their counterparts receiving short-term mechanical ventilation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiologic-and-pathophysiologic-consequences-of-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiologic and pathophysiologic consequences of mechanical ventilation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Studies have identified the following as common problems that occur during PMV: infection (eg, bacterial pneumonia, tracheobronchitis, line sepsis, Clostridium difficile colitis, urosepsis), volume overload, tracheal bleeding, ileus, renal failure, pneumothorax, seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-patients-requiring-prolonged-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>]. Laryngeal edema is also common. In a prospective study of 95 patients undergoing PMV (mean duration 28 days), 37 percent had laryngeal edema (defined as a cuff leak &lt;140 mL) when assessed at the time of tracheostomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-patients-requiring-prolonged-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>Diagnosis of pneumonia in patients undergoing PMV is particularly difficult because the airways of these patients are frequently colonized with bacteria. This was illustrated by a study that performed quantitative bronchoalveolar lavage in 14 asymptomatic patients who required PMV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-patients-requiring-prolonged-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. There was growth of at least one organism at &gt;10,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">CFU/mL</span> (the generally accepted minimum for diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia) in 29 of the 32 lobes sampled. Thus, the utility of quantitative bronchoscopic culture in patients who require PMV is uncertain and requires further study. Until then, clinicians need to rely more heavily on other indicators of infection.</p><p>Many patients are transferred from the intensive care unit (ICU) to a long-term acute care (LTAC) facility for PMV and weaning. Although pneumonia is the most common infectious disease in patients that require PMV, little data exists regarding the epidemiology of ventilator-associated pneumonia in LTAC. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the causative microorganisms are initially the same as those prevalent in the ICU of origin and later the flora prevalent in the LTAC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-patients-requiring-prolonged-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-diagnosis-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, microbiology, and diagnosis of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Tracheostomy is another source of complications seen in patients receiving PMV. Examples of tracheostomy complications include loss of airway patency due to unplanned decannulation, fistula formation between the trachea and the innominate artery, and obstruction of the tracheal tube can occur due to mucous plugging or the development of granulation tissue. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-tracheostomy#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of tracheostomy&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Family members and caregivers tend to be more optimistic than clinicians about the eventual outcomes. This was demonstrated by an observational study of 126 patients requiring PMV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-patients-requiring-prolonged-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. The study found that family members and caregivers were more likely than clinicians to expect the patient to be alive (94 versus 43 percent), lack major functional limitations (71 versus 6 percent), and have a good quality of life (83 versus 4 percent) one year later.</p><p>Estimates of mortality and other clinical outcomes vary considerably for patients undergoing PMV. The variability probably reflects whether the population studied is a general population of patients requiring PMV or a subset of patients selected for their high weaning potential. It may also reflect the transfer practices (from the intensive care unit [ICU] to a long-term acute care [LTAC] facility) of the hospitals studied, as hospitals that more readily transfer patients from the ICU to an LTAC have been shown to have lower mortality rates and shorter lengths of stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-patients-requiring-prolonged-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>However, overall mortality for these patients is high and, even for the survivors, quality of life is low. It is important that clinicians educate patients and families about these potential outcomes prior to tracheostomy placement and have ongoing discussions with patients regarding overall goals of care. (See <a href=\"#H208898631\" class=\"local\">'Assessing patient goals and preferences'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients undergoing PMV have a high burden of palliative care needs and a high mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-patients-requiring-prolonged-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/48,55-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,55-62</a>]. The high mortality rates in this population were illustrated by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis of 39 studies of patients on PMV reported a one-year mortality of approximately 60 percent (73 percent in US hospitals and 47 percent in non-US hospitals) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-patients-requiring-prolonged-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One observational study of 1419 patients on PMV reported a similar one-year mortality of 52 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-patients-requiring-prolonged-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Among these patients, 25 percent died in the weaning hospital and 27 percent died after discharge. Patients were excluded from the study if they were admitted for end-of-life care, terminal weaning, or were deemed incapable of weaning at the time of admission. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a smaller study of 80 patients who were admitted to a respiratory care unit for PMV and survived to discharge, 55 percent died within one year after discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-patients-requiring-prolonged-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Poor skin integrity and chronic irreversible neurologic diseases were associated with increased risk for mortality. Survivors of PMV tend to be those who are younger and spent less time in the ICU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-patients-requiring-prolonged-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a Canadian database analysis of hospital admissions between 2002 and 2013, there were 11,600 patients who underwent PMV (PMV &gt;21 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-patients-requiring-prolonged-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. When compared with the patients who did not undergo PMV, patients who underwent PMV had a higher in-hospital mortality (42 versus 28 percent), and they were more likely to be discharged to other facilities (85 versus 44 percent). Among the patients who were discharged from the hospital, those who underwent PMV were more likely to die (17 versus 11 percent) and be readmitted to hospital at one year (47 versus 38 percent).</p><p/><p>The use of variables to predict mortality has been evaluated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-patients-requiring-prolonged-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/60,66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,66,67</a>].

The absence of these factors was associated with 15 percent mortality, whereas the presence of three or four factors was associated with a mortality of 97 percent.

Unless a patient has respiratory failure due to an irreversible disease process, patients requiring PMV should not be considered permanently ventilator-dependent until at least three months of weaning has failed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-patients-requiring-prolonged-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>In a meta-analysis of 39 studies of patients on PMV only 50 percent (range 47 to 53 percent) were successfully liberated from mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-patients-requiring-prolonged-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Similarly, a retrospective cohort study of 135 patients admitted to an LTAC facility for weaning reported that 43 percent were successfully weaned and the remaining 58 percent were fully or partly dependent upon mechanical ventilation at one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-patients-requiring-prolonged-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].

In an observational study of 80 patients requiring PMV (defined in this study as &ge;7 days of mechanical ventilation), the proportion of patients who were home, institutionalized, and deceased at six months were 47, 14, and 39 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-patients-requiring-prolonged-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Three or fewer comorbid conditions and an Acute Physiology Score &le;21 were associated with the best outcomes.

However, QOL tends to improve over years. </p><p>While mortality rates are high, it appears that certain patients are able to regain substantial function. An observational study of 718 patients who required 14 or more days of mechanical ventilation in the ICU revealed that 99 percent of three-year survivors were independent and living at home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-patients-requiring-prolonged-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Only 50 percent reported mild to moderate functional impairment. Another study examined 25 patients discharged from a ventilator rehabilitation unit and demonstrated that PMV had no independent adverse effect on QOL several years later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-patients-requiring-prolonged-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. QOL instead appeared to be related to the presence or absence of chronic underlying diseases.</p><p>ARDS survivors who require PMV have poorer QOL than other ARDS survivors. In a study of 74 patient with ARDS who required PMV (mean duration of ventilation 28 days), neurocognitive sequelae were detected in 77 percent of survivors at discharge and 47 percent of survivors two years later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-patients-requiring-prolonged-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. In addition, 25 percent of patients reported moderate to severe depression and anxiety two years after discharge.</p><p>Approximately 76 percent of patients who survive PMV and tracheostomy indicate that they would have chosen mechanical ventilation if they were able to make the decision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-patients-requiring-prolonged-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. But, the responses are influenced by their current health, as well as the financial and emotional burden that their illness had on their family. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9749739\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuropsychological</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Survivors of critical illness commonly experience neurocognitive and psychological dysfunction. Data from prospective observational cohorts of patients who survive ICU admission suggest that the populations at risk are older patients and those with acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-patients-requiring-prolonged-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/75-79\" class=\"abstract_t\">75-79</a>]. </p><p>Psychologic dysfunction has also been noted in populations that have undergone PMV that are transferred to LTAC facilities for ventilator weaning. In a prospective cohort study of 336 patients transferred to a LTAC facility for PMV, 42 percent were diagnosed with depressive disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-patients-requiring-prolonged-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. These patients were at higher risk for weaning failure and mortality. In a similar study with 41 patients, 12 percent were diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder within three months following weaning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-patients-requiring-prolonged-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].</p><p>Long-term cognitive impairment has been associated with the presence, severity, and duration of associated delirium in survivors of critical illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-patients-requiring-prolonged-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. Critical illness has also been identified as a potential risk factor for dementia. These issues are discussed in detail separately.

One cost-effectiveness analysis found that providing PMV costs $55,460 per life-year gained and $82,411 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, compared to withdrawal of ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-patients-requiring-prolonged-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. The incremental costs per quality-adjusted life-year gained exceeded $100,000 among those patients who were &ge;68 years old or whose predicted one year mortality was &gt;50 percent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=a-short-primer-on-cost-effectiveness-analysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;A short primer on cost-effectiveness analysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Much of this cost is probably related to the cost of ongoing and recurrent medical care. This was suggested by a prospective cohort study that followed patients who required PMV for one year following discharge from the acute care hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-patients-requiring-prolonged-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. Sixty-seven percent of patients required at least one readmission to an acute care hospital, 74 percent of days alive were spent in a health care facility or receiving home health care, and 91 percent of patients had some functional dependency at the end of the study.

In the 1990s, changes in reimbursement created incentives to transfer patients undergoing PMV from the ICU of acute care hospitals to long-term assisted care (LTAC) facilities. Many patients requiring PMV undergo weaning and discontinuation of mechanical ventilation in an LTAC. The selection of patients for transfer from an ICU to an LTAC is discussed separately.
