The clinician should also obtain a general medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests that are guided by the history and examination. Unipolar major depression is generally diagnosed according to the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F89994\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89994 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-anxiolytics/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p>Assessment of major depression can be facilitated by using the Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 Item (PHQ-9) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59307\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59307 \">table 2</a>), which is a nine item self-report instrument that screens for episodes of major depression, has good psychometric properties, is in the public domain, and can be filled out by patients prior to the appointment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-anxiolytics/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

An alternative self report questionnaire is the Beck Anxiety Inventory, which consists of 21 items and focuses upon somatic symptoms, but is copyrighted and must be purchased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-anxiolytics/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].

Benzodiazepines should be used cautiously or avoided in patients with a history of alcohol or substance abuse, or a history of problematic adherence to antidepressants; both groups may want to stop the antidepressant and continue only the benzodiazepine due to the benzodiazepine&rsquo;s more rapid clinical effect. </p><p>If a benzodiazepine is indicated during treatment of unipolar major depression with an antidepressant, we generally start <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonazepam</a> at a dose of 0.5 mg at bedtime and titrate up over one to two weeks to a maximum dose of 2 mg per day, given at bedtime or divided in two daily doses. Although each of the benzodiazepines can be prescribed adjunctively with an antidepressant to treat unipolar depression, we prefer high potency, intermediate half-life agents (eg, clonazepam or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a>). Compared with low potency, longer half-life drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlordiazepoxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlordiazepoxide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a>), high potency, intermediate half-life agents generally have simpler metabolisms with fewer active metabolites, and may thus have a lower risk of sedation and psychomotor problems such as falls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-anxiolytics/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In addition, clonazepam has been frequently studied for augmentation of antidepressants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-anxiolytics/abstract/11,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,33,34</a>].

In addition, as needed dosing may interfere with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), by promoting rescue medication as a coping strategy that competes with the coping skills taught in CBT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-anxiolytics/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Benzodiazepines should be tapered over two to four weeks prior to discontinuation; tapering over a period less than two weeks may lead to rebound symptoms of depression and anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-with-anxiolytics/abstract/33,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,39</a>], and abrupt discontinuation can cause seizures. For patients who have been on a benzodiazepine for more than six months, we typically decrease the total daily dose by 10 percent every week until discontinuation.

Anxiety symptoms that are part of a depressive syndrome are distinguished from anxiety disorders that are comorbid with depressive disorders. (See <a href=\"#H1664453\" class=\"local\">'Anxious depression'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=comorbid-anxiety-and-depression-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Comorbid anxiety and depression in adults: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute treatment of unipolar major depression with antidepressants is less effective in patients with higher levels of baseline anxiety than patients with lower levels. However, adjunctive anxiolytics can improve outcomes in anxious depression. Indications for augmenting antidepressants with anxiolytics to treat unipolar major depression include symptoms of anxiety, moderate to severe insomnia, psychomotor agitation, excessive activation induced by antidepressants, the need to accelerate improvement in patients with moderate to severe depression, and treatment resistant depression. (See <a href=\"#H1664453\" class=\"local\">'Anxious depression'</a> above and <a href=\"#H30535209\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-of-resistant-depression\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Treatment of resistant depression&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contraindications to augmenting antidepressants with anxiolytics (especially benzodiazepines) to treat depression include several comorbidities, such as chronic posttraumatic stress disorder, severe antisocial or borderline personality disorder, moderate to severe substance use disorders antedating onset of the depressive syndrome, mild cognitive impairment or dementia, and general medical conditions such as severe myopathic disorders and chronic respiratory disease. (See <a href=\"#H87788652\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depressive symptoms can be assessed with the self-report Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 Item (PHQ-9) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59307\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59307 \">table 2</a>), and anxiety symptoms with the self-report scale for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD-7). A reasonable alternative is to use self-report visual analog scales. (See <a href=\"#H10011920\" class=\"local\">'Patient assessment'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=using-scales-to-monitor-symptoms-and-treat-depression-measurement-based-care#H100014092\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Using scales to monitor symptoms and treat depression (measurement based care)&quot;, section on 'Patient Health Questionnaire - Nine Item'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In using an adjunctive anxiolytic to treat severe unipolar major depression that includes anxiety <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> insomnia, we typically start the anxiolytic at the same time as the antidepressant. For mild to moderate depression, we generally use a stepped care approach, in which the antidepressant is titrated up and administered for a sufficient period to evaluate its efficacy as monotherapy; if anxiety <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> insomnia persist, we then add the anxiolytic. (See <a href=\"#H5087207\" class=\"local\">'When to start the anxiolytic'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We generally coadminister the anxiolytic and the antidepressant for four to six weeks, and then taper the anxiolytic for two to four weeks prior to discontinuation. However, longer taper schedules may be necessary for benzodiazepines. (See <a href=\"#H10011853\" class=\"local\">'Duration of treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H30535216\" class=\"local\">'Benzodiazepines'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with unipolar major depression, prescribing a benzodiazepine (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonazepam</a> 0.5 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> at bedtime or divided in two daily doses) plus an antidepressant can improve symptoms of anxiety and depression, and also improve treatment adherence. However, the potential harms of adding a benzodiazepine include tolerance (diminished effect over time), physiologic dependence, sedation, amnestic effects, impaired psychomotor speed, and increased accidents.
