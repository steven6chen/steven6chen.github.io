KD also occurs rarely in adults. It is typically a self-limited condition, with fever and manifestations of acute inflammation lasting for an average of 12 days without therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-complications/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, complications such as coronary artery (CA) aneurysms, depressed myocardial contractility and heart failure, myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, and peripheral arterial occlusion may develop and lead to significant morbidity and mortality (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F56475\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56475 \">table 1</a>). Noncardiac complications may also affect children with KD.</p><p>The complications of KD are discussed in this topic review, with long-term cardiovascular sequelae of KD reviewed in greater detail separately. The epidemiology, etiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of KD, refractory KD, and incomplete (atypical) KD are also presented separately.

It may be accompanied by multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), with MODS seen in 8 of 11 patients with KD and shock in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-complications/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. It is important to distinguish patients with KDSS from those with other causes of severe hypoperfusion since aggressive use of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG), which is essential for the successful control of KDSS, is not typically used in other types of shock. The presence of anemia and thrombocytosis is more common in KDSS as opposed to thrombocytopenia in toxic shock syndrome (TSS) and septic shock. The features that are most suggestive of KDSS, however, are younger age (mean age approximately three years in KDSS versus nine years for TSS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-complications/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] and the presence of echocardiographic abnormalities, particularly valvulitis and coronary artery (CA) lesions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sepsis-syndromes-in-adults-epidemiology-definitions-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-prognosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sepsis syndromes in adults: Epidemiology, definitions, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-of-shock-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation of shock in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-shock-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of shock in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In one case series from a single institution, 13 of 187 consecutive patients with KD (7 percent) presented with KDSS between 2003 and 2007 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-complications/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. All patients with KDSS received fluid resuscitation, and seven also received inotropic agents. Patients with shock syndrome were more likely than KD patients who were hemodynamically stable to have consumptive coagulopathy and cardiac abnormalities including impaired left ventricular systolic function, mitral regurgitation, and CA abnormalities. In addition, patients who presented with shock had higher C-reactive protein (CRP) levels than those with uncomplicated KD. Most importantly, children with KDSS were also less responsive to initial IVIG therapy and more commonly required additional treatment for their KD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2507753\"><span class=\"h1\">CARDIAC COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>KD may cause both coronary artery (CA) dilatation as well as myocardial abnormalities. The most significant effects of KD involve pathologic changes in the coronary arteries. Acute, necrotizing arteritis, subacute and persistent arterial inflammation, and luminal myofibroblastic proliferation appear to affect most if not all children with KD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-complications/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Depending on their severity, these processes may result in formation of aneurysms (defined as dilatation of coronary arteries to more than 4 mm internal diameter), ectasia (representing less severe yet still abnormal CA diameters), functional vasodilatory abnormalities despite a normal arterial diameter, and stenosis of the vascular lumen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-complications/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-sequelae-of-kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular sequelae of Kawasaki disease: Clinical features and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other cardiac sequelae also can occur, including decreased myocardial contractility, mild valvular regurgitation (primarily mitral valve involvement), and pericardial effusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-complications/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Infants younger than one year of age with KD have the highest risk of developing cardiac complications, including CA aneurysms, despite treatment with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG). Acute myocardial infarction is the main cause of death in KD, and the risk of having an acute myocardial infarction is highest in children with so-called giant CA aneurysms, with an internal diameter of &gt;8 mm. Smaller, but nonetheless significant, and persistent enlargement of the coronary arteries is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, while the long-term effects of minimal or transient CA dilatation are less clear. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=incomplete-atypical-kawasaki-disease#H607415436\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Incomplete (atypical) Kawasaki disease&quot;, section on 'Infants'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kawasaki disease: Initial treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-sequelae-of-kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-evaluation#H242696497\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular sequelae of Kawasaki disease: Clinical features and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Cardiovascular complications'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2507760\"><span class=\"h2\">Coronary artery abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CA aneurysms occur in approximately one in five untreated children with KD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65317\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef65317 \">movie 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F53864\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef53864 \">movie 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76878\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef76878 \">movie 3</a>). The frequency of aneurysm development and the rate of mortality have decreased dramatically as a result of IVIG therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-complications/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The prognosis of CA aneurysms depends on the size and shape of the aneurysm. The best prognosis is associated with aneurysms &lt;8 mm in diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-complications/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In contrast, giant CA aneurysms, with an internal diameter &gt;8 mm, have the highest risk of morbidity and mortality. Up to one-half of such aneurysms become obstructed, leading to myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, or sudden death. The acute evaluation, treatment, natural history, and long-term monitoring of CA aneurysms are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kawasaki disease: Initial treatment and prognosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-sequelae-of-kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-evaluation#H242696505\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular sequelae of Kawasaki disease: Clinical features and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-sequelae-of-kawasaki-disease-management-and-prognosis#H3119159481\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular sequelae of Kawasaki disease: Management and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a>.)</p><p>A far larger percentage of children with KD have more subtle and often transient CA changes. How significant CA changes (ie, ectasia) are defined is somewhat arbitrary and varies from study to study. The cutoff for an abnormal CA diameter, for example, can range from 1.5 to 2.5 age- and gender-adjusted deviations from the mean (measured as standard deviation units and known as the &quot;Z-score&quot;). In general, the greater the degree of coronary ectasia in a child with KD, the more likely vascular dilatation will persist after the acute phase of disease resolves.</p><p>As an example, serial echocardiography was performed at presentation and one and five weeks later in a prospective study of 190 patients with KD participating in a clinical trial that evaluated the addition of glucocorticoid therapy to conventional IVIG therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-complications/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In all patients, a maximum CA Z-score normalized to body surface area was significantly greater than normal at all time points. In approximately one-quarter of the patients, a maximal Z-score &ge;2.5 was noted at some time during the course of the disease. Conversely, in a retrospective review of 100 children treated for KD from a single tertiary center in the United States, 43 percent had a CA abnormality on their initial echocardiogram, defined as enlargement of a CA to &ge;1.5 times its normal diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-complications/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. All but five cases had echocardiography performed within 24 hours of treatment for KD. CA ectasia was seen in 31 percent of patients and CA aneurysms in 13 percent. Only 11 percent had CA lesions on their final echocardiogram (ectasia in 6 percent and aneurysm in 5 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1213989795\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk factors for coronary artery aneurysms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several clinical findings at presentation are associated with an increased risk of developing CA aneurysms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-complications/abstract/9,13-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13-22</a>]. These risk factors have varied somewhat in different series, although they most consistently include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age younger than one year or older than nine years</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Male sex</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever &ge;14 days</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum sodium concentration &lt;135 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hematocrit &lt;35 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>White blood cell count <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;12,000/mm<sup>3</sup></span></p><p/><p>It is not clear whether the increased risk in older and younger children is a result of late diagnosis, which delays administration of IVIG therapy, or an intrinsic susceptibility to CA dilatation in these populations. In one retrospective study, infants &lt;6 months of age who were treated within 10 days of fever onset were still at increased risk of CA aneurysms compared with older children (13.2 versus 4.1 percent), suggesting that delay in treatment is not the primary factor conferring increased risk in this age group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-complications/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In the United States, the risk of CA aneurysms varies among ethnic groups. Genetic risk factors are also associated with CA aneurysms. These risk factors are discussed in greater detail separately.

Clinically, this is manifested by an S3 gallop that may become more prominent with hydration. Depressed myocardial contractility may progress to heart failure during the acute phase of the illness, although typically treatment with IVIG restores normal contractility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-complications/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Lymphocytic infiltrates or fibrosis are sometimes noted on endomyocardial biopsy even years after the acute illness, especially in children who do not receive IVIG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-complications/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1305931109\"><span class=\"h1\">MACROPHAGE ACTIVATION SYNDROME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS, also called secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis [HLH]) is characterized by activation and proliferation of macrophages and T cells. This may lead to severe complications including disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, cytopenias, and thrombosis. MAS may complicate a variety of infections, rheumatologic conditions, and malignancies. It has been described rarely in children with KD who have persistent and sustained fever after intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-complications/abstract/25-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-33</a>]. A small number of children with secondary HLH have mutations of perforin or other genes that are more typically associated with congenital HLH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-complications/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The clinical features of HLH and the diagnosis and treatment of MAS are reviewed in greater detail separately.

Cases with MAS were characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenias, hypofibrinogenemia (&lt;1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L),</span> and hyperferritinemia, findings not usually seen in uncomplicated cases of KD. However, hemophagocytosis was evident in only three cases, and commonly used criteria for the diagnosis of HLH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-complications/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>] correctly identified only one case of MAS complicating KD. The preliminary MAS diagnostic guidelines (Ravelli criteria) were more accurate in identifying patients with MAS in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-complications/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Seven of eight patients with MAS were nonresponders to IVIG, two developed coronary artery (CA) ectasia, and one of the eight died. Thus, early recognition of MAS as a complication of KD is crucial, both in order to optimize treatment for KD and to administer potentially lifesaving therapy for the MAS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2507774\"><span class=\"h1\">NONCORONARY VASCULAR INVOLVEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>KD has a definite but unexplained predilection for coronary arteries, although virtually any vascular bed may be affected. Medium-sized muscular arteries (eg, axillary, iliac, brachial, and mesenteric) are the most commonly involved, while small arteries, veins, and visceral vessels are relatively spared [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-complications/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>The following are vascular changes that can occur in peripheral and visceral arteries:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral arterial obstruction can lead to ischemia and gangrene.

Among the rare extra-cardiac presentations of KD are cases involving the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, and central nervous system. Other diagnoses should be considered when the presenting features are atypical.

ARF is a rare complication, and the underlying pathologic processes vary in different patients. Hemolytic-uremic syndrome, immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis, and acute interstitial nephritis, for example, have each been reported in a handful of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-complications/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].

Initial evaluation included acoustic immittance measurement and brainstem-evoked response audiometry. Those found to have hearing disability also underwent otoacoustic emissions analysis. Hearing loss was identified in 55 percent of patients within the first 30 days, and 30 percent still had hearing loss six months later. Persistent sensorineural hearing loss was associated with delayed use of IVIG and prolonged thrombocytosis, anemia, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).

However, other cardiac sequelae can occur, including decreased myocardial contractility, coronary arteritis without aneurysms, mild valvular regurgitation (primarily mitral valve involvement), and pericardial effusion. Acute myocardial infarction is the main cause of death in KD.
