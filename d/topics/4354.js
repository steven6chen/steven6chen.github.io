The most common cause of HUS is due to Shiga toxin-producing <em>Escherichia coli</em> (STEC).

This discovery has had a major impact on identifying the underlying cause of familial HUS, and on the management of these patients, who historically have had a poor prognosis.</p><p>The clinical manifestation, diagnosis, and management of complement-mediated HUS will be reviewed here.

It is important to stress that the penetrance of the disease is low, as less than half of family members carrying the same mutation as the patient with atypical HUS will be affected with the disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29839687\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The complement proteins associated with complement-mediated HUS are components of the alternative complement pathway. HUS results from a loss-of-function mutation in a regulatory gene (<em>CFH</em>, <em>CFI</em>, or <em>CD46</em>) or a gain-of-function mutation in an effector gene (<em>CFB</em> or <em>C3</em>). The proposed mechanism for the development of HUS is a trigger event, such as infection or pregnancy, in a susceptible individual with a gene mutation(s) or antibodies to complement proteins, which leads to uninhibited continuous activation of the alternative pathway resulting in the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complement-mediated-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome/abstract/10,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14,15</a>]. This causes renal endothelium damage leading to activation of the coagulations cascade and thrombotic microangiopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complement-pathways#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complement pathways&quot;, section on 'Alternative pathway'</a>.)</p><p>Data from an animal study suggest that <em>C5</em> activation is important in the pathogenesis of HUS, thus supporting the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eculizumab-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">eculizumab</a>, a humanized monoclonal antibody to <em>C5</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complement-mediated-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

CFH in conjunction with complement factor I (CFI) competes with complement factor B (CFB) for C3b binding and accelerates C3 convertase decay. Over 100 mutations of <em>CFH</em> have been reported, most of which are missense mutations that do not affect the levels of CFH and C3. In these patients, mutations generally affect the C-terminal region, which is important for binding to C3b, glucosaminoglycans, heparin, and endothelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complement-mediated-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Other mutations are located throughout the gene and are associated with low levels of CFH antigen. Interestingly, renal survival is higher in patients with low CFH levels compared with those with normal levels of CFH.</p><p><em>CFH</em> gene mutations have been associated with both autosomal recessive and dominant forms of HUS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complement-mediated-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome/abstract/20-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-26</a>]. Patients with homozygous mutations have very low serum levels of CFH antigen, low serum C3 and CFB antigen levels, and a low CH50. However, most patients are heterozygous for the mutation and have normal or only slightly decreased serum CFH <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <em>C3</em> levels. As a result, normal factor H and C3 levels do not exclude the presence of a <em>CFH</em> mutation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-and-clinical-assessment-of-the-complement-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview and clinical assessment of the complement system&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although several studies have reported that HUS associated with <em>CFH</em> mutations usually presents during infancy or early childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complement-mediated-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome/abstract/20-22,27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22,27-30</a>], results from a French study showed that 25 of 59 patients with <em>CFH</em> mutations initially presented after 20 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complement-mediated-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The disease either may be sporadic or clearly associated with a family history of disease. Severe hypertension is frequently observed. Hemolytic anemia is marked at disease onset and during relapses, with haptoglobin levels remaining low during the course of the disease.</p><p>Patients with <em>CFH</em> mutations have the worst outcome of all the patients with complement-mediated HUS. The natural course of this disease results in 60 to 70 percent of patients progressing to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or death within one year of presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complement-mediated-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome/abstract/17,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,31</a>]. In addition, there is a high rate of recurrent disease in patients who undergo renal transplantation.

CD46 is a cofactor of CFI in the degradation of C3b and C4b. The aberrant protein either results in decreased cell surface levels of CD46 (most common) or an impaired ability to control alternative pathway complement activation on host cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complement-mediated-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. HUS associated with CD46 deficiency is characterized by onset in early childhood, a favorable renal outcome in most patients, frequent relapses, and a low rate of recurrence in the renal allograft.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Factor I mutations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mutations in <em>CFI</em>, the cofactor for CD46 and factor H, are also associated with HUS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complement-mediated-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome/abstract/31,37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,37-39</a>]. CFI is a serine protease, which cleaves C3b and C4b in the presence of CFH and CD46. Most patients have heterozygous <em>CFI</em> mutations, which result in either a quantitative or qualitative defect of the protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complement-mediated-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. The prognosis of patients with HUS associated with <em>CFI</em> mutations is intermediate between those with HUS associated with <em>CD46</em> and those with <em>CFH</em> mutations. As an example, in two cohort studies, 50 to 60 percent of patients progressed to ESRD or died within two years of presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complement-mediated-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome/abstract/31,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,39</a>], and in one of the studies, 30 percent of patients recovered from the initial presentation without disease recurrences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complement-mediated-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Of note, in one of the cohort studies, 8 of 23 patients had an additional known genetic risk factor for HUS (ie, mutation of <em>CD46</em>, <em>CFH</em>, <em>C3</em>, or <em>CFB</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complement-mediated-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

These mutations are primarily located in the binding regions of C3b that interact with CFH, CD46, and complement receptor 1, and result in dysregulation of the alternative complement pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complement-mediated-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Patients with <em>C3</em> mutations typically develop severe disease, with one-half to two-thirds of patients progressing to ESRD within the first year following presentation. Recurrent disease is common in patients following renal transplantation. In addition, there is an increase in the incidence of at-risk <em>CFH</em> and <em>CD46</em> haplotypes for HUS in these patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29840315\"><span class=\"h2\">Factor B mutations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gain of function mutations of <em>CFB</em>, which either enhances the formation or delays the inactivation of C3bBb convertase, have been reported in 1 to 3 percent of cases of complement-mediated HUS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complement-mediated-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. Progression to ESRD occurs in 70 percent of patients.

In a study of 152 patients with atypical HUS (ie, non-Shiga toxin-producing <em>E. coli</em> [STEC]-HUS), seven patients had six different heterozygous mutations of the <em>THBD</em> gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complement-mediated-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. In vitro studies demonstrated that the mutated <em>THBD</em> resulted in dysregulation of the complement system because it was less effective than normal thrombomodulin in converting C3b to its inactive form iC3b.

These antibodies interfere with the binding of CFH to the C3 convertase and are associated with a defective CFH-dependent cell protection. A study of 308 cases of atypical HUS (Newcastle cohort) reported the presence of CFH antibodies in 13 of 142 screened patients (9.2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complement-mediated-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

In particular, living-related donor transplantation is not recommended unless genetic testing has been performed to ensure that the same mutation is not present in the potential living donor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complement-mediated-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome/abstract/101,102\" class=\"abstract_t\">101,102</a>]. In our practice, a living-related transplantation is only performed if both the donor and the recipient have given informed consent, if the recipient has a mutation with a high risk of recurrence that is absent in the donor, and if eculizumab therapy is administered to the recipient at the time of and after transplantation to reduce the risk of disease recurrence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H264004917\"><span class=\"h4\">Preventive therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preventive therapy to reduce the risk of recurrent disease includes <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eculizumab-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">eculizumab</a> and plasma therapy.

The most common cause of HUS is due to Shiga toxin-producing <em>Escherichia coli</em> (STEC). Complement-mediated HUS accounts for most of the non-STEC-HUS.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complement-mediated HUS is a relatively rare disorder, with an estimated prevalence of seven per one million children in Europe. Most complement-mediated HUS cases are due to gene mutations of complement factors, although acquired complement dysregulation due to antibodies to complement proteins occurs in 6 to 10 percent of patients with complement-mediated HUS. (See <a href=\"#H1369647994\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The complement proteins associated with complement-mediated HUS are components of the alternative complement pathway. They include complement factors H, I, and B (CFH, CFI, and CFB), C3, CD46 (previously known as membrane cofactor protein [MCP]), and thrombomodulin (THBD). (See <a href=\"#H104164148\" class=\"local\">'Genetic complement disorders'</a> above and <a href=\"#H179048059\" class=\"local\">'Genetic mutations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H29840479\" class=\"local\">'Complement antibodies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The proposed pathogenesis of complement-mediated HUS is that a trigger (eg, infection) causes uninhibited continuous activation of the alternative complement pathway in a susceptible individual with either gene mutations or antibodies to complement proteins. This results in renal endothelial damage leading to thrombotic microangiopathy. (See <a href=\"#H29839687\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to the clinical triad of HUS (microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury), patients with complement-mediated HUS typically will have a history of a triggering antecedent event (eg, upper respiratory infection or diarrheal illness). There is often a positive family history, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a history of a previous episode. Severe hypertension is a common clinical finding. (See <a href=\"#H112362578\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical course and outcome vary depending on the affected complement component. (See <a href=\"#H9168716\" class=\"local\">'Clinical course and outcome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with <em>CFH</em> mutations generally have a poor prognosis with most patients progressing to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or death within the first year of presentation. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Factor H mutations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In contrast, patients with mutations of <em>CD46</em> do not usually progress to ESRD, although relapse is common. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'CD46 mutations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with <em>CFI</em> mutations have an intermediate course between those with <em>CFH</em> and <em>CD46</em> mutations, with one-half of patients progressing to ESRD or death within two years of presentation. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Factor I mutations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of complement-mediated HUS is based on the clinical presentation of the classical triad findings of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury, and demonstration of complement dysregulation, either due to gene mutations of complement proteins or antibodies to complement factors.
