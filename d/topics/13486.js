Significant reductions in low-density lipoprotein C levels were noted, although normal levels were not achieved in most subjects.</p><p/><p>What is not clear is whether genetic information for individuals who have no known increased risk prior to genetic testing will lead to change in lifestyle behaviors. In a sample of over 2000 patients who completed genome-wide testing through a direct-to-consumer vendor, testing did not result in any short-term change in diet or exercise behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-medicine/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Skeptics also argue that, while there are selected examples where specific biomarkers or genetic tests can help guide medical decision-making, more widely implemented profiling remains largely unrealistic in clinical practice. Factors cited to support this viewpoint include the high costs of testing (which may decline), the lack of reliable predictive biomarkers for most conditions, the lack of clear therapeutic alternatives (based on genetic differences) for many conditions, and the lack of knowledge and expertise among most clinicians regarding genetics, risk prediction, and genetic counseling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-medicine/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. These issues are discussed in more detail below. (See <a href=\"#H2097402\" class=\"local\">'Obstacles for implementation'</a> below.)</p><p>Nonetheless, momentum for the implementation of personalized medicine in clinical practice is increasing. The price of exome sequencing and whole genome sequencing is continuing to fall, and the catalog of disease-associated copy number variants or deleterious sequence variants, produced from genome-wide association studies, array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH), and next-generation sequencing (including exome sequencing and whole genome sequencing), is rapidly increasing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-medicine/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Several sequence variants have been suitable for predictive pharmacological assays in being both relatively common and prognostically relevant. Despite obstacles, there is strong support for the development of personal genomics among healthcare policy makers and research funding agencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-medicine/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2097366\"><span class=\"h1\">PERSONALIZED MEDICINE INITIATIVES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Available biomarker assays are impacting the practice of several medical specialties, most notably in oncology.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2799869006\"><span class=\"h2\">Cancer detection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The concept of a biomarker test to detect cancer in asymptomatic individuals is especially appealing because it could lead to early diagnosis; reduce the use of more aggressive, more toxic, more costly therapy; and potentially result in a greater number of individuals being cured of their disease.</p><p>CancerSEEK is a multi-analyte blood test that detects common, cancer-associated DNA variants using a panel of 61 amplicons for cancer &quot;driver&quot; mutations (for which only one abnormal copy would be sufficient to cause cancer) as well as 41 protein biomarkers associated with common cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-medicine/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In a series of 1005 individuals already known to have nonmetastatic cancer of one of eight common cancer types (ovary, liver, stomach, pancreas, esophagus, <span class=\"nowrap\">colon/rectum,</span> lung, or breast), the median sensitivity for detecting cancer was 70 percent. Among individual tumor types, sensitivity was highest for ovarian cancer (98 percent) and lowest for breast cancer (33 percent). Sensitivity increased with more advanced-stage cancers (43 percent for stage I, 73 percent for stage II, and 78 percent for stage III). Specificity was over 99 percent; only 7 of 812 healthy individuals without known cancer tested positive, and it is possible that these individuals had early cancer that was not clinically detectable. The test was also able to determine the type of cancer in the majority of individuals (median, 63 percent). Limitations of the study included the presence in case patients of more advanced cancers than would be expected in the general population, and an absence of chronic inflammatory conditions in the controls that might lead to more false positive tests. Additional validation is needed before this test is incorporated into clinical practice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2541378\"><span class=\"h2\">Cancer treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some cases, gene expression profiling may help to stratify the need for therapy or the type of therapy in patients with early-stage cancer.

This trial randomly assigned 195 patients with metastatic solid tumors, for which standard treatments were ineffective, to receive a molecularly-targeted agent (based on the molecular profile of the tumor) versus standard of care. The median progression-free survival was similar between the two groups (2.3 versus 2.0 months). One conclusion from this study was that further research into personalized medicine is needed. Additional research may focus on combining molecularly targeted agents to overcome resistance or incorporating information about tumor evolution using circulating tumor DNA.

As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 2007, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in the United States launched the Personalized Health Care Initiative (PHCI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-medicine/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Broadly, the following types of genetic tests are available:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Specific single gene tests</strong> &ndash; Most gene-specific tests are performed as part of a focused risk evaluation for heritable disease or for diagnostic considerations. Examples include <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em> gene sequencing for carrier identification in at-risk individuals with a strong family history of breast cancer, or pharmacogenetic testing to guide dosing of chemotherapeutic agents in individuals with sequence variants that affect drug metabolism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic testing&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pharmacogenomics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pharmacogenomics&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Specific gene panels </strong>&ndash; Panels that provide sequence variant information for multiple genes have been developed for clinical testing to determine the etiology of conditions with high genetic heterogeneity, in which mutations in multiple genes can cause the same phenotype. Examples include panels to test for genetic causes of intellectual disability, epilepsy, autism, and hereditary deafness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Genotyping panels of selected susceptibility variants</strong> &ndash; These panels are often bundled as direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic tests and include SNPs that have been associated with common, complex diseases such as type 2 diabetes, autoimmune disease, and metabolic traits. Due to the inherent genetic complexities of these disorders, the genetic effects conferred by each of the SNPs are often relatively small (odds ratios of &lt;1.5 for risk variants) and inconsistent across different ethnic populations. The predictive accuracy of these tests therefore is highly variable and most of the panels have not been comprehensively validated. (See <a href=\"#H2097388\" class=\"local\">'Direct-to-consumer testing'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Whole genome or exome sequencing</strong> &ndash; High-throughput sequencing platforms (often referred to as next-generation sequencing [NGS]) enable sequencing of the coding regions of the entire human exome (ie, all regions of the genome that encode proteins) or genome (ie, regions of the genome that encode proteins as well as regulatory elements). The use of whole genome sequencing remains in the realm of research testing for most conditions, due to the difficulties in interpreting the large amounts of data that result from this test. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=next-generation-dna-sequencing-ngs-principles-and-clinical-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS): Principles and clinical applications&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Results from array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) and SNP arrays can also be used for clinical diagnostic or research purposes.

Pharmacogenetics is the study of variability in drug response due to genetic factors, and includes the prediction of a patient&rsquo;s response to a specific therapy and susceptibility to toxicity and adverse events. Pharmacogenetic data may inform both the selection of a particular treatment and the individualized dose and dosing schedule for that treatment. This subject is described in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pharmacogenomics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pharmacogenomics&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Drug labels for numerous drugs include information regarding pharmacogenetic biomarkers that can be tested. Though most notably impacting dosing of medications used to treat hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, pharmacogenetic markers are also available for medications used in the treatment of infectious, cardiac, rheumatologic, and pulmonary diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-medicine/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Label content includes warnings regarding genotype-specific contraindications or toxicities, dosing recommendations, or information regarding the availability of genetic tests (without specific recommendations for testing). An updated listing of pharmacogenetic biomarkers cited in drug labels in the United States is available on the <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ScienceResearch/ResearchAreas/Pharmacogenetics/ucm083378.htm&amp;token=a9bXIsRSaFvv1dWn8wLbosnX6XimTDRwqYSCeTRq5koS1PHEW8hzPUyZZE1/EwRQjoPQde4Y4FW/3nR703IXcycxELMVEFU8li7/F5Kg6JVzL33Jl3cLCuDE0pXYJdse&amp;TOPIC_ID=14599\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">US Food and Drug Administration</a> website.</p><p>The most extensively studied pharmacogenetic variants are those of the cytochrome P450 drug metabolizing liver enzymes (CYPs). Fifty-eight CYPs have been characterized in humans, and functional SNPs that alter functional activity have been identified for many CYPs. The Amplichip <em>CYP450</em> test is clinically available in the United States as a DNA oligonucleotide genotyping microarray for simultaneous characterization of 29 SNPs in the genes <em>CYP2D6</em> and <em>CYP2C19</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-medicine/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. These variants influence the metabolism of a wide range of commonly prescribed medications, including 33 with pharmacogenetic biomarker labels. However, this test has not been widely adopted for clinical use, since the clinical value of this array has not been validated in prospective studies and insurance reimbursement is infrequently available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H582867830\"><span class=\"h2\">Genotyping panels</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genotyping refers to testing for the allele status of an individual at polymorphic loci that can be associated with disease. In contrast to sequencing, genotyping assays are designed from previous knowledge of the existence of a particular genetic variant, commonly a SNP. Numerous Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified genotyping technologies have been developed for simultaneous characterization of dozens to hundreds of loci. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-testing#H4098116583\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic testing&quot;, section on 'Types of genetic testing'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=next-generation-dna-sequencing-ngs-principles-and-clinical-applications#H22497411\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS): Principles and clinical applications&quot;, section on 'Whole genome, exome, or gene panel'</a>.)</p><p>Publication of hundreds of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of common variants that confer only a very small to modest alteration in disease risk, most commonly for complex diseases. These findings have led to the development of genotyping panels for testing for many of these variants. The SNP content and diseases covered vary from panel to panel, although there is overlap among the most commonly studied variants. The predictive accuracy of these panels is highly variable, and the clinical utility of these tests has not been established and remains unclear at present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic association studies: Principles and applications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2097381\"><span class=\"h2\">Exome and genome sequencing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whole genome sequencing (WGS) or whole exome sequencing (WES) differs from specific gene tests or genotyping panels by determining the sequence of every exon or gene in an individual&rsquo;s genome using massive, parallel sequencing. The technology used to obtain the sequence is referred to as next-generation sequencing (NGS). Exome sequencing is more common; WGS is more often undertaken in a research setting, although clinical testing by WGS using available in the United States.</p><p>Advantages of NGS are the ability to provide information regarding all sequence variants, including alterations in copy number, if WGS is performed, rather than only interrogating a small fraction of known genes. As more knowledge is gained regarding the spectrum of disease-causing variants and catalogs of such variation are assembled, complete sequence information will provide greater predictive accuracy than genotyping panels. The NGS technology and its clinical indications are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=next-generation-dna-sequencing-ngs-principles-and-clinical-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS): Principles and clinical applications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Because NGS interrogates the entire exome or genome, it may also reveal unexpected findings unrelated to the reason for which the test was performed, which may indicate previously unknown genetic risks. Such sequence variants have been loosely termed &quot;secondary&quot; findings. Some of these variants may have a clear association with disease if they constitute known mutations, whereas others may be of uncertain significance, termed variants of unknown significance (VUS). Decisions regarding which findings to disclose to the patient are an area of active research. Consent for exome sequencing typically provides patients and families with the choice as to whether they would like to receive secondary findings (eg, &quot;opt-out&quot; option).

Consequently, prenatal genetic testing is playing an increasing role in obstetrical care, with a move towards implementation of personalized approaches in fetal medicine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-medicine/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal screening for common aneuploidies using cell-free DNA&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An example is the implementation of a non-invasive prenatal test (NIPT) of cell-free fetal DNA (cf-DNA), also called free fetal DNA (ff-DNA) sequences from maternal blood samples for the Rhesus D blood group (RhD) allele. In about 10 percent of non-Hispanic white pregnancies, RhD-seronegative mothers carry an RhD-positive fetus. These mothers are at risk of RhD sensitization during delivery, with consequential risk to subsequent RhD-positive pregnancies for life-threatening hemolytic crises. Maternal sensitization is preventable with timely administration of anti-D antibodies, and anti-D prophylaxis of RhD-negative mothers is standard in prenatal care. However, about 40 percent of RhD-negative mothers (those carrying RhD-negative fetuses) receive anti-RhD (a blood product) unnecessarily. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-pregnancy-complicated-by-rhesus-d-alloimmunization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of pregnancy complicated by Rhesus (D) alloimmunization&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Non-invasive genotyping assays have been developed that type the RhD allele in ff-DNA circulating in maternal blood. The assay has a diagnostic accuracy approaching 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-medicine/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], with better accuracies noted with newer assays that include rigorous positive controls to confirm sufficient quantities of circulating fetal DNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-medicine/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, the test performs less well in non-white populations, due to the presence of alternative sequence variants. Non-invasive screening of RhD-negative pregnancies using this method could spare about 40 percent of mothers from unnecessary exposure to anti-RhD therapy and avoid more invasive testing (ie, amniocentesis) in previously sensitized mothers during subsequent pregnancies. Many European countries of predominantly white ancestry have implemented routine ff-DNA screening for RhD-sensitized mothers. Fewer support the more generalized screening in all RhD-negative mothers, largely due to the high costs of mass screening. For example, a cost-effectiveness analysis in the United Kingdom concluded that at current test and immunization costs, routine ff-DNA screening of all RhD-negative mothers would not result in cost-savings or appreciable health benefits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-medicine/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

In the United States, the regulatory status of DTC genomic testing and interpretation has shifted, along with testing for carrier status for specific conditions. Personal genome testing has been available to the general public in the United Kingdom and Canada since late 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-medicine/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>The following illustrates the history of the availability of genetic testing services by the company 23andMe, which has been the most active in seeking regulatory approval for DTC genetic testing from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In approximately 2006, 23andMe began directly marketing genetic testing services to the general public; this included testing for risk variants associated with certain medical conditions, as well as <span class=\"nowrap\">genealogy/ancestry</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In late 2013, the FDA requested that the company discontinue marketing of their health-related personal genome service (PGS; ie, disease-risk prediction) in the United States, because the clinical validity of the service had not been demonstrated by the company [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-medicine/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The FDA considered the PGS kit to be a device and hence under their regulatory purview. The company suspended its clinical services in the United States but continued to provide services related to raw genetic data, information about carrier status, and ancestry testing, as well as testing services in the United Kingdom. Carrier testing was approved in the United States for Bloom syndrome in 2015, followed by more large-scale, yet constrained, assessments for carrier status for other conditions and for wellness and personal traits such as sleep quality, lactose intolerance, and caffeine consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-medicine/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. Results are returned to patients using reporting formats approved by the FDA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In February 2015, the FDA authorized for marketing DTC carrier testing by 23andMe in the United States for Bloom syndrome (an autosomal recessive disorder) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-medicine/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Simultaneously, the FDA classified all carrier-screening tests as class II medical devices, subject to general controls such as misbranding. The FDA subsequently exempted these tests from premarket review. With these regulatory changes, 23andMe and several other companies have begun offering DTC carrier screening for a variety of conditions. As an example, in early 2017, 23andMe began providing DTC testing for increased risk of a predetermined set of 10 conditions that include celiac disease, factor XI deficiency, G6PD deficiency, and late-onset Alzheimer disease; results of this testing might result in lifestyle modifications <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> discussions with a clinician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-medicine/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. It should be noted that these tests improve patient access to information about carrier status, but it is unclear how well they will be used, particularly in the absence of pre- or post-test genetic counseling.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In March 2018, the FDA authorized marketing DTC testing for three BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations that are common in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-medicine/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. These represent a very small subset of BRCA mutations, which number over 1000, and they are not common in the general population. The FDA advised that information from this testing &quot;should not be used&hellip;to determine any treatments.&quot;</p><p/><p>DTC testing commonly uses a kit for saliva-based testing that can be sent through the mail.</p><p>A number of concerns have been raised about the accuracy, interpretation, and value of DTC genetic testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-medicine/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The following examples illustrate some of these concerns:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Reliability and reproducibility</strong> &ndash; Given the heterogeneity among DTC vendors in the markers tested and the predictive models used to develop risk estimates, questions have been raised regarding the reliability and reproducibility of these services. The accuracy of identifying mutations or disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is one concern; the accuracy of using the resulting information to predict the risk of disease is a separate concern of equal or greater importance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Two studies have evaluated these issues; both have found high concordance between companies in determining genotype, but significant variability in interpretation of disease risk, despite agreement on genotype:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>One study compared genotyping panels from two DTC companies: 23andMe and Navigenics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-medicine/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. DNA from five individuals was sent to each company for testing, and risk predictions for 13 diseases were compared. Genotype calls (ie, the genotypes reported at each locus based on SNP analysis) were in excellent agreement (&gt;99 percent concordance). In contrast, risk prediction for diseases was discordant in about a third of cases. Disease risk predictions from the two companies <strong>disagreed</strong> more than half of the time for seven conditions (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus, heart disease, Crohn disease, type 2 diabetes); risk predictions were concordant in four conditions. Conditions demonstrating strong agreement were those in which an identical SNP with a very strong genetic effect was tested by both companies (for example, the SNP for celiac disease that confers a sevenfold increase in risk). SNPs with such strong effects are rarely observed in common complex diseases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A second study evaluated the concordance across three companies (23andMe, Navigenics, and deCODE), although only one sample was tested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-medicine/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Genotype concordance was high (99.6 percent), but significant variability in risk prediction was noted, with undetermined clinical validity and utility. The variability in risk prediction was influenced by the SNPs that were genotyped for each condition and the reference population used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-medicine/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Diseases for which genotyped SNPs have strong predictive value were more likely to receive similar risk estimates from different DTC companies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-medicine/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. This study also pointed out the need for risk data that is based upon client ethnicity, as the majority of genome-wide association studies have focused on Caucasians, with uncertain applications to other ethnicities, including Asian, African, and Hispanic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-medicine/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">These reports suggest that risk prediction remains unreliable, and interpretation of results for most SNPs should be approached with caution.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Generalizability</strong> &ndash; In most cases, data about genetic risk has been obtained from testing individuals with a known personal or family history of disease. Data from testing a healthy population has not yet been obtained for most conditions, and it has not been demonstrated that risk is similar when a variant is identified in an individual with a negative personal and family history of disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Implications for management</strong> &ndash; Results from genetic testing, both normal and abnormal, may have major implications for management. In their 2013 notification to the 23andMe company regarding screening for medical risk variants, the US FDA expressed concerns regarding the potential misuse of reported genetic information leading to inappropriate management. As an example, patients might make treatment decisions regarding prophylactic mastectomy, chemoprevention, or aggressive surveillance based on false-positive or false-negative <em>BRCA1</em> genotypes. An editorialist suggested that the FDA may not have intervened if the genome service had been available only to an ordering physician, rather than marketed directly to consumers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-medicine/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The implications of results should be discussed with a clinical geneticist, genetic counselor, or clinician with expertise in the condition in question, but as the amount of DTC testing increases, resources to provide such counseling may become strained.</p><p/><p>To the extent that results of DTC testing promote healthy lifestyle and health maintenance interventions such as exercise, healthy diet, and recommended screenings (eg, cancer screening, risk assessment for cardiovascular disease), they are likely to be of value to the individual. For disorders in which other interventions may be appropriate (eg, medication, surgery), the value of speaking with a clinical geneticist, genetic counselor, or expert clinician should be emphasized regardless of the results of DTC testing. These experts may help with interpretation of results, additional testing not provided in the DTC product, and interventions most likely to be helpful. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-counseling-family-history-interpretation-and-risk-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic counseling: Family history interpretation and risk assessment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, patients should be made aware that:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For all but a limited number of SNPs of large effect, the majority of SNPs tested provide only incremental changes in a patient&rsquo;s risk profile.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prospective studies of the predictive accuracy of these products have not been performed, thus precluding the provision of effective counseling or reliable decision-making for most results.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is substantial inter-company variability in the risk estimates reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-medicine/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The influence of non-genetic factors, including race and lifestyle factors, on the interpretation of these results is unknown for many of the SNPs tested.</p><p/><p>These caveats make the point that for most conditions, a negative test result (ie, susceptibility variant not identified) does not guarantee low risk for disease development, and positive lifestyle modifications should be encouraged regardless of DTC testing results.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2097395\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER PERSONALIZED MEDICINE PLATFORMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The early and intuitive focus for personalized medicine has been the development of genetic-based tests. Other &quot;omic&quot; approaches are being developed that will provide a more complete characterization of risk that includes variation between individuals in gene regulation, epigenetics, and cellular metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-medicine/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Such approaches, which are under development as part of research and rarely provided clinically, include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gene expression profiling (also referred to as transcriptomics) &ndash; Analysis of mRNA (of either individual genes or panels of gene targets), representing gene expression patterns; often uses microarray technology although whole transcriptome analysis (also known as RNA-Seq) is also possible. Gene expression is dynamic and influenced by a range of cellular, genetic and environmental factors, which makes gene expression a particularly attractive target for profiling malignant cells. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tools-for-genetics-and-genomics-gene-expression-profiling\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tools for genetics and genomics: Gene expression profiling&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proteomics &ndash; Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the collection of protein constituents in a biological sample. Typically performed using modification of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) or matrix-assisted laser <span class=\"nowrap\">desorption/ionization</span> (MALDI) approaches, these methods provide measures of the types and abundance of proteins in a biological sample.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metabolomics &ndash; The characterization of metabolic profiles; typically consists of a collection of assays that characterize panels of metabolites related to specific pathways. These studies can be static (cross-sectional profiling at a given time-point) or dynamic (assessing the change in profile patterns following a specific metabolic challenge) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-medicine/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In combination with separation methods such as high-performance liquid chromatography or gas chromatography, metabolites are typically characterized either by mass spectrometry (MS) or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lipidomics &ndash; Characterization of the complete collection of lipids. Lipid structures, like metabolites, can be differentiated by MS or NMR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-medicine/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. These methods are being applied towards the development of diagnostic tests that assess the lipid composition of cell membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-medicine/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epigenomics &ndash; Profile of the modifications to DNA (often, methylation) that control gene expression. Unlike genomic changes, epigenomic changes are affected by the environment and may change with age, stress, or exposures to the individual or earlier generations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exposomics &ndash; The sum of exposures an individual incurs over a period of time.

A common example is the gut microbiome, which might influence adiposity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> immunity.</p><p/><p>Few of these applications are being used routinely in clinical practice, although development of reliable, clinically adaptable assays for these platforms is actively being pursued. One important exception is in the field of oncology, where gene expression profiling of malignant cells or tissue is becoming an important diagnostic and prognostic tool. Some of the earliest and most successful implementations of gene expression profiling in oncology focused on single genes, such as determining estrogen receptor expression status in breast cancer for informing prognosis and chemotherapeutic options [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-medicine/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Subsequently, whole transcriptome expression profiling technologies have been applied to tumor samples, with notable success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-medicine/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2097402\"><span class=\"h1\">OBSTACLES FOR IMPLEMENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite early successes in the clinical introduction of a limited number of pharmacogenetic assays, multiple barriers preclude the widespread implementation of personalized medicine as standard clinical practice across all medical fields. The development of validated biomarkers and genetic assays represents an important bottleneck, as does the analysis of the masses of data than can result from next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, although it is likely that the prospect of affordable exome and whole genome sequencing will remove this obstacle in the future. Other ethical and data storage challenges will remain.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Limited predictive value of most tests</strong> &ndash; There are a limited number of examples where genetic testing provides substantial gains in guiding therapeutic recommendations for healthy individuals, although diagnostic genetic testing may be very useful for patient management and recurrence risk estimation. However, the number of genetic variants associated with disease susceptibility and pharmacogenetic response is increasing, especially in the oncology field.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lack of physician knowledge</strong> &ndash; The lack of general knowledge of genetics among many medical practitioners is one of the most pressing challenges preventing broad implementation of personalized medicine. Many medical practitioners do not feel adequately prepared to provide counseling for genetic testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-medicine/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>] and the number of genetic counselors and clinical geneticists in North America has been hypothesized to be lower than required to meet expected demands. However, medical schools are actively developing curricula content in the areas of personalized medicine to prepare the next generation of physicians, including several programs that have developed case-studies of whole genome sequence data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-medicine/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. However, there is little infrastructure in place to facilitate the education of clinicians already in practice.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">To bridge the knowledge gaps, reporting is structured with clinical annotation to provide detailed interpretations, including detailed summaries of the significance of sequence variants and estimated disease risks, advisories based on the types of identified pharmacogenetic variants. Laboratory reports may also include novel variants of unclear clinical significance (VUS).

This model is inadequate to accommodate NGS data, and newer approaches that include an easily accessible electronic medical record (EMR) are under development. Although adoption of EMRs has increased, the majority of those in place would require substantial enhancement to accommodate the data storage and processing needs anticipated for genomic data. The Personalized Health Care Initiative has made the nationwide development of EMRs a top priority [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-medicine/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], and the Office of National Coordination for Health Information Technology (ONC) was established in 2004 by executive order to facilitate the establishment of an electronic health record (EHR) across the United States that would coordinate information across multiple EMRs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Information providence and patient privacy issues</strong> &ndash; Many questions arise when considering how personal genomic information should be managed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Who would be responsible for ordering a pharmacogenetic genotyping panel (ie, the major CYP loci) that profiles responsiveness for a wide array of drugs?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>How would such information be transmitted to other clinicians and pharmacists?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>When should genomic profiling be ordered?
