Cardinal features in adults include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obstructive apneas, hypopneas, or respiratory effort related arousals</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Daytime symptoms attributable to disrupted sleep, such as sleepiness, fatigue, or poor concentration</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs of disturbed sleep, such as snoring, restlessness, or resuscitative snorts</p><p/><p>OSA is an important disorder because patients are at increased risk for poor neurocognitive performance and adverse medical outcomes, due to repeated arousals <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypoxemia during sleep over months to years. The severity and duration of OSA for development of these sequelae vary among individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, severe untreated OSA is associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.</p><p>The epidemiology, risk factors, pathophysiology, and outcome of OSA in adults are reviewed here. The definition, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OSA is the most common sleep-related breathing disorder. Prevalence estimates vary according to the way in which OSA metrics are collected and the distribution of risk factors in the population being studied. The estimated prevalence in North America is approximately 20 to 30 percent in males and 10 to 15 percent in females when OSA is defined broadly as an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) greater than five events per hour as measured by a polysomnogram [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. When more stringent definitions are used, either combining an AHI &ge;5 events per hour with report of at least one symptom of disturbed sleep (eg, daytime sleepiness) or using an AHI &ge;15 events per hour, the estimated prevalence is approximately 15 percent in males and 5 percent in females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. The prevalence of OSA in the United States appears to be increasing due to rising rates of obesity. (See <a href=\"#H760313\" class=\"local\">'Obesity'</a> below.)</p><p>The prevalence of OSA also varies by race and ethnicity. OSA is more prevalent in African Americans who are younger than 35 years old compared with Caucasians of the same age group, independent of body weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. The prevalence of OSA in Asia is similar to that in the United States, despite lower rates of obesity, and linked risk related to craniofacial anatomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H760186\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most important is sleep. Clinical risk factors are advancing age, male gender, obesity, and craniofacial morphology or upper airway soft tissue abnormalities. Additional factors identified in some studies include smoking, nasal congestion, menopause, and family history. Rates of OSA are also increased in association with certain medical conditions, such as pregnancy, end-stage renal disease, congestive heart failure, chronic lung disease, pot-traumatic stress disorder, and stroke.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H760299\"><span class=\"h2\">Age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of OSA increases from young adulthood through the sixth to seventh decade, then appears to plateau [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/3,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H760306\"><span class=\"h2\">Gender</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OSA is approximately two to three times more common in males than females, although the gap narrows at the age of menopause in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/2,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9,10</a>]. The mechanisms for this difference are being defined. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H760313\"><span class=\"h2\">Obesity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In both males and females, the prevalence of OSA progressively increases as the body mass index (BMI) and associated markers (eg, neck circumference, waist-to-hip ratio) increase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. In a prospective study of nearly 700 adults with four-year longitudinal follow-up, a 10 percent increase in weight was associated with a sixfold increase in risk of incident OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In a population-based study of over 1000 adults who underwent polysomnography, moderate to severe OSA (AHI &ge;15) was present in 11 percent of men who were normal weight, 21 percent of those who were overweight (BMI 25 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>),</span> and 63 percent of those who were obese (BMI &gt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. For adult women, the trend was the same: OSA was present in 3 percent of those who were normal weight, 9 percent of those who were overweight, and 22 percent of those who were obese. In a retrospective cohort study of 184 obese individuals with wake-time hypoxemia, the prevalence of OSA (AHI &gt;5) was 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The strong association between OSA and obesity has implications for the absolute and potential burden of OSA in populations. In a study that used age- and BMI-specific OSA prevalence data from a prospective North American cohort modeled in relation to BMI population distributions from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database, the estimated prevalence of OSA increased from 1990 to 2010 in every age group and BMI category studied, in some cases by as much as 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In adult males, the estimated prevalence of OSA (defined as an AHI &ge;5 plus daytime sleepiness) rose from 11 to 14 percent over the span of two decades; in adult females using the same definition, the prevalence rose from 4 to 5 percent.</p><p>Obesity, particularly when severe (BMI &ge;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>),</span> carries a risk for concomitant obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). Patients with OHS have awake hypoventilation in addition to high rates of comorbid OSA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-obesity-hypoventilation-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of obesity hypoventilation syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H760320\"><span class=\"h2\">Craniofacial and upper airway abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Craniofacial and upper airway soft tissue abnormalities each increase the likelihood of having or developing OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These factors are best recognized in Asian patients where obesity is not as obvious an issue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Examples of abnormalities include an abnormal maxillary or short mandibular size, a wide craniofacial base, tonsillar hypertrophy, and adenoid hypertrophy.</p><p>In children, adenotonsillar hypertrophy and a variety of neurological and medical conditions that can affect neural control of the upper airway or impact the collapsibility of the upper airway, such as cerebral palsy and low birth weight, are recognized risk factors for OSA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of suspected obstructive sleep apnea in children&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H760384\"><span class=\"h2\">Other risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nasal congestion confers an approximately twofold increase in the prevalence of OSA compared with controls, regardless of cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This is probably related to increased resistance due to decreased nasal patency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]; however, OSA may or may not improve with correction of nasal congestion.</p><p>Smoking appears to increase the risk of OSA or at least aggravate preexisting symptoms. In one study, current smokers were nearly three times more likely to have OSA than past or never smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Menopausal women appear to have an increased risk of OSA compared with premenopausal women, independent of age and BMI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. </p><p>Patients with OSA often report a family history of snoring or OSA. While this could be due to shared behavioral factors related to obesity, there may also be a genetic predisposition to OSA through factors such as craniofacial structure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. It has been suggested that about one-fourth of the prevalence of OSA as a disease has a genetic basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>While a variety of substances and medications, including alcohol, benzodiazepines, and narcotics, may exacerbate OSA, a causative link is unproven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

This leads to intermittent disturbances in gas exchange (eg, hypercapnia and hypoxemia) and fragmented sleep.</p><p>While upper airway collapse can occur during both rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM sleep, decreased genioglossus muscle tone during REM sleep significantly increases the propensity for upper airway obstruction. As a result, the severity of OSA in REM sleep is striking in some individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. There is some evidence that REM-predominant sleep apnea may exacerbate the adverse cardiovascular and metabolic effects associated with OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. </p><p>The severity of OSA in any given individual is influenced by other factors as well, including upper airway anatomy, arousal threshold, upper airway muscle drive, and stability of the respiratory control system. In addition, the underlying pathophysiology may vary by age, with younger patients more likely to have alterations in ventilatory control and older patients more likely to have predominant upper airway collapsibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>The mechanisms of upper airway obstruction in adults and children are discussed separately.

While both symptoms are relatively sensitive, they lack specificity for a diagnosis. In a systematic review of the accuracy of the clinical examination in the diagnosis of OSA, the most useful individual finding for identifying patients with OSA was nocturnal choking or gasping, which was associated with a sensitivity and specificity of 52 and 84 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Sleep apnea in women tends to present with complaints of insomnia and sleepiness, and mood changes rather than loud snoring and witnessed apneas. </p><p>Additional symptoms and signs may include restless sleep, periods of silence terminated by loud snoring, fatigue, poor concentration, nocturnal angina, nocturia, and morning headaches (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55633\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55633 \">table 1</a>). Common findings on physical examination include obesity, a crowded oropharyngeal airway, large neck circumference, and hypertension.

However, their sensitivity is generally much higher than their specificity such that when the score is low, the likelihood of OSA is low. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults#H25136797\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;, section on 'Screening questionnaires'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In-laboratory polysomnography is the first-line diagnostic study when OSA is suspected. However, home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) may be an acceptable alternative for patients who are strongly suspected of having OSA and who do not have medical comorbidities (eg, heart failure or lung disease) that require more detailed or additional sleep-related measures (sleep stage, arousals, leg and arm movements, seizure monitoring, etc). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=home-sleep-apnea-testing-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Home sleep apnea testing for obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>The formal diagnosis of OSA is made based upon a combination of an increased frequency of obstructive apnea events during sleep and daytime signs or symptoms of disturbed sleep. In adults, a diagnosis of OSA is defined by either of the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are five or more predominantly obstructive respiratory events (obstructive and mixed apneas, hypopneas, or respiratory effort related arousals) per hour of sleep (for polysomnography) or recording time (for HSAT) in a patient with one or more of the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sleepiness, nonrestorative sleep, fatigue, or insomnia symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Waking up with breath holding, gasping, or choking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Habitual snoring, breathing interruptions, or both noted by a bed partner or other observer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hypertension, mood disorder, cognitive dysfunction, coronary artery disease, stroke, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, or type 2 diabetes mellitus</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are 15 or more predominantly obstructive respiratory events (apneas, hypopneas, or respiratory effort related arousals) per hour of sleep (for polysomnography) or recording time (for OCST), regardless of the presence of associated symptoms or comorbidities.</p><p/><p>The diagnostic strategies for OSA are discussed separately. As OSA is so common, it is likely that screening with technology like smart phones may play a role in disease and health detection.

Alternative diagnoses to consider in patients with a primary complaint of abrupt awakenings, choking, or gasping sensations during sleep are aspiration, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and panic attacks especially in those with panic disorders.</p><p>While some of these conditions can be distinguished from OSA by clinical history, a polysomnography or home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) is generally required to rule in or rule out OSA, and define severity.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prevalence of OSA in the general adult population is approximately 20 to 30 percent in males and 10 to 15 percent in females if it is defined as an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) greater than five events per hour. When defined as an AHI &ge;5 events per hour accompanied by at least one symptom or sign of OSA, the prevalence is approximately 15 percent in males and 5 percent in females. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Well-defined risk factors for OSA include older age, male gender, obesity, craniofacial abnormalities, and upper airway soft tissue abnormalities.
