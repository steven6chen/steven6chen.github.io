They are important tools for airway management and are used frequently in the prehospital environment, emergency department, operating room, and other settings. They can be primary airway devices, such as during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or rescue devices for failed airways.</p><p>This topic reviews the types of extraglottic devices (EGD) commonly found in emergency settings, how to place them and use them for intubation, and their appropriate role in emergency airway management. Other devices used for emergency airway management, approaches to emergency airway management in various clinical settings, and the use of EGD in the operating room are discussed separately.

They are important tools for emergency airway management and may be used as either primary or rescue devices, although they do not provide a definitive airway that protects the trachea from obstruction or aspiration. </p><p>Indications for placing an EGD include the need for oxygenation and ventilation. Contraindications include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of a gag reflex (risk of vomiting and aspiration); may be used in patients with gag reflex who are paralyzed as part of rapid sequence intubation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trauma or disease of the oropharynx or proximal esophagus (risk of mucosal perforation), such as caustic ingestion, or known esophageal varices (risk of perforation or airway hemorrhage).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Airway obstruction by a foreign body (risk of pushing a supraglottic foreign body into the trachea).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3726927768\"><span class=\"h2\">Types of devices and their features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ideal EGD should be easy to place, provide effective oxygenation and ventilation, and allow the clinician to perform gastric decompression and tracheal intubation. Few EGDs satisfy all these criteria. A table summarizing the basic features of several common EGDs, including their location relative to the glottis and suitability for blind intubation, is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F106515\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106515 \">table 1</a>). Each of the devices listed is highly effective for providing oxygenation and ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extraglottic-devices-for-emergency-airway-management-in-adults/abstract/1-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-16</a>].</p><p>Several EGD classification schemes have been proposed. The simplest is based on the location of the EGD within the airway and includes supraglottic and retroglottic airway devices:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supraglottic devices are laryngeal <strong>masks</strong> that seal around the glottic inlet and remain superior to the larynx (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F79779\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79779 \">figure 1</a>). Examples of laryngeal masks can be found in the following photographs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F103863\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103863 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F81776\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81776 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retroglottic devices are laryngeal <strong>tubes</strong> that terminate in the upper esophagus &ndash; posterior to the glottis &ndash; and have two balloon cuffs, one pharyngeal and one esophageal, with ventilation fenestrations in between that align with the glottic opening (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67135\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67135 \">figure 2</a>). An example of a laryngeal tube can be found in the following photograph (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79762\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79762 \">picture 3</a>). </p><p/><p>Other classification schemes are based on the presence of clinically important features. One such scheme divides EGDs into first- and second-generation devices depending on the presence of an orogastric (OG) decompression port (present in &quot;second-generation&quot; EGDs). The option of gastric decompression may help to reduce the risk of aspiration. Another scheme distinguishes EGDs by the ability to perform tracheal intubation through the lumen of the EGD. </p><p>For emergency patients, the ability to intubate through an EGD is an important design feature. After failed laryngoscopy, an intubation-capable EGD should be placed. Many of these have demonstrated high success rates for maintaining oxygenation and ventilation. Once oxygenation is reestablished, intubation through the EGD&ndash;using the ventilation channel as a conduit for an endotracheal tube (ETT)&ndash;can often be performed. Some intubation-capable EGDs are designed for blind intubation and all of them can be used in conjunction with a flexible endoscope. The option for blind intubation is particularly important for providers who do not have access to flexible endoscopes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1884826990\"><span class=\"h2\">Use in emergency settings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EGDs are used widely in emergency airway management. In the prehospital environment, EMS systems that perform rapid sequence airway (RSA) management use EGDs for patient transport. RSA involves giving induction and neuromuscular blocking medications (similar to rapid sequence intubation) but then placing an EGD rather than a tracheal tube [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extraglottic-devices-for-emergency-airway-management-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The EGD is exchanged later for an ETT, typically during transport or after the patient arrives in the ED. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation for adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.) </p><p>EGDs are used frequently for primary airway management in patients in cardiac arrest, and as rescue devices after failed laryngoscopy to provide oxygenation and ventilation until a definitive airway can be established. In cardiac arrest patients, placement and ventilation using an EGD can be performed by a second clinician without interrupting chest compressions. Following failed laryngoscopy, early placement of an appropriate EGD typically allows for excellent oxygenation, minimal gastric insufflation, little risk of aspiration, decompression of the stomach, and a high likelihood of successful blind intubation. If blind intubation fails, a flexible endoscope can be passed through the EGD to assist with tracheal intubation. </p><p>Ideally, EGDs can convert a &quot;can't intubate, can't oxygenate&quot; situation into a &quot;can't intubate, CAN oxygenate&quot; scenario. If placed early in some such situations, oxygenation via the EGD obviates the need for cricothyrotomy. However, it must be emphasized that placement of an EGD should not be attempted if it delays placement of a required surgical airway. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-cricothyrotomy-cricothyroidotomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency cricothyrotomy (cricothyroidotomy)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As emergency clinician experience with EGDs expands, use of these devices is increasing. The reasons for this include the following: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EGDs consistently provide effective oxygenation and ventilation. There is an increasing body of evidence in emergency patients showing oxygenation success rates of 70 to 100 percent on first pass, and 90 to 100 percent following either one or two attempts at placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extraglottic-devices-for-emergency-airway-management-in-adults/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EGDs may provide more effective oxygenation and ventilation than bag-mask ventilation (BMV). Thus, EGDs may be useful for re-oxygenation between laryngoscopy attempts, or instead of BMV in apneic patients. One prospective multicenter study of EGD use by emergency medical technicians reported a first-attempt success rate for ventilation of 76 percent, compared to 30 percent with traditional BMV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extraglottic-devices-for-emergency-airway-management-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A review of similar studies involving prehospital CPR reported improved ventilation with an EGD compared to BMV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extraglottic-devices-for-emergency-airway-management-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EGDs may be associated with less regurgitation compared to BMV. A retrospective study of 713 patients receiving CPR found less regurgitation with EGDs compared to BMV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extraglottic-devices-for-emergency-airway-management-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EGD placement is easily taught, and skills learned on a manikin transfer readily to patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extraglottic-devices-for-emergency-airway-management-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This is unlike BMV, which requires more skill and practice to create and maintain a mask seal, particularly in challenging clinical situations (eg, bearded patient, blood or vomit over face). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EGDs are useful if assistants are limited. Placing an EGD frees a provider to perform other needed tasks, since proper BMV often requires two clinicians, whereas an EGD requires only one.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain EGDs allow for additional management options, such as gastric decompression or tracheal intubation through the EGD.</p><p/><p>Clinicians responsible for emergency airway management should be familiar with the EGDs available at their hospitals and other locations (eg, ambulance). In addition, emergency clinicians should help select the EGDs available to them and be certain that these are well suited to their work environment. As an example, if fiberoptic bronchoscopes are not available it may be important to have access to an EGD through which blind intubation can be performed with a high rate of success. </p><p>Relatively few controlled studies assessing and comparing EGDs in emergency department patients have been performed, making it difficult to recommend any specific device, but some evidence suggests that certain EGDs may be more useful in emergency settings. The Fourth National Audit Project from the United Kingdom has reported that aspiration was the most common cause of death in anesthesia cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extraglottic-devices-for-emergency-airway-management-in-adults/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. However, aspiration was rare in patients being managed primarily with EGDs. The authors recommend using EGDs with gastric decompression ports (second-generation EGDs) to reduce the risk of aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extraglottic-devices-for-emergency-airway-management-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The ability to decompress the stomach is likely to be of greater importance in non-fasted patients requiring airway management, who are more common in emergency settings. In addition, it is likely that several episodes of bag-mask ventilation have been performed on patients requiring EGDs for airway rescue following failed laryngoscopy, and these episodes may have filled the stomach with air. Gastric decompression via an EGD may make ventilation easier and regurgitation less likely in such cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1107774953\"><span class=\"h1\">SUPRAGLOTTIC AIRWAYS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The supraglottic class of extraglottic devices (EGDs) consists entirely of laryngeal masks in design. This means that, instead of making a mask seal on the face as in bag-mask ventilation (BMV), the mask seal is made over the glottic opening. The masks of supraglottic airways seal superiorly around the base of the tongue, laterally around the aryepiglottic folds and piriform recesses, and inferiorly in the upper esophagus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F79779\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79779 \">figure 1</a>). The ventilation channel is oriented to send oxygen directly into the glottic opening.</p><p>Several manufacturers produce laryngeal mask devices that have been successful in oxygenation and ventilation. Multiple observational studies document the effectiveness of these devices for emergency airway management, including use in difficult airways and challenging environments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extraglottic-devices-for-emergency-airway-management-in-adults/abstract/1,3-16,18,25-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3-16,18,25-32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2962294672\"><span class=\"h2\">Laryngeal mask airways (LMA)</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2618090567\"><span class=\"h3\">Types of LMAs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is designed to create a mask seal over the laryngeal inlet in order to oxygenate and ventilate patients for short to intermediate periods (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F103894\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103894 \">figure 3</a>).

Another notable feature of the LMA Fastrach is the epiglottic elevating bar to facilitate intubation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F107884\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef107884 \">picture 10</a>).</p><p>Given the unique characteristics of the LMA Fastrach, it is helpful to have descriptions of the techniques for placing it in the airway, performing intubation through it and removing it; these are provided below. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4026494583\"><span class=\"h4\">Placement of LMA Fastrach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The steps for LMA Fastrach placement are described below and demonstrated in the video clips embedded in the following text:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Place the LMA Fastrach so the cuff lies on a flat surface, and deflate the mask completely by aspirating air from the pilot balloon with a syringe (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F110701\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef110701 \">movie 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lubricate both sides of the LMA with a water-soluble lubricant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hold the LMA in your dominant hand by the handle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stand at the head of the bed and open the mouth with standard airway maneuvers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76790\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76790 \">picture 9</a>).

During placement, the leading edge of the LMA cuff may push the epiglottis tip causing it to fold over, resulting in difficult ventilation or a cuff leak. If this occurs, the &quot;Up-Down Movement&quot; may help. To perform this maneuver, leave the cuff inflated and pull the LMA back about 6 cm with the same rotation used to insert it, then slide it back to its original position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F110703\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef110703 \">movie 4</a>). This tends to reposition the folded epiglottis. </p><p>If the cuff leak persists, better alignment of the cuff and glottic opening can be achieved with the &quot;Chandy maneuver,&quot; in which the handle is slightly rotated in the sagittal (up and down) and coronal (side to side) planes. To increase cuff pressure against the glottis, the handle can also be lifted vertically using a &quot;skillet lift,&quot; as if the operator is lifting a skillet off the stove (ie, the handle remains roughly parallel to the floor while being lifted). All three maneuvers are shown in the following video clip (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F110704\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef110704 \">movie 5</a>).</p><p>Once the cuff leak is corrected, the operator has a few options. First, if the cuff pressure is &lt;40 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, additional air can be inflated into the cuff to improve the seal and enable adequate ventilation, and the handle released. Alternatively, the operator can continue holding the handle and maintaining the LMA in the optimum position until intubation is completed. The authors suggest intubating the patient. With the cuff leak corrected and ventilations successful, the ventilation channel should be lined up well with the glottic opening and passage of an ETT through the lumen of the LMA Fastrach is likely to be successful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3191779851\"><span class=\"h4\">Intubation through LMA Fastrach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Effective oxygenation and ventilation suggest the LMA Fastrach cuff is well aligned with the glottis and intubation can be attempted through the device. To intubate, either the proprietary silicone non-kinking endotracheal tube (ETT) or a standard ETT may be used, with similar success rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extraglottic-devices-for-emergency-airway-management-in-adults/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. If a standard ETT is used, it is helpful to warm the tube slightly to increase flexibility. A standard ETT is introduced into the LMA Fastrach with a reversed curvature (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F110712\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef110712 \">picture 11</a>) so the leading tip emerges from the LMA at a shallower angle, facilitating entry into the trachea.

However, we caution novices against doing this, as the procedure is relatively complicated and can result in displacement of the ETT from the trachea, or ripping the pilot balloon from its tubing which then deflates the ETT cuff. If the clinician wishes to proceed and remove the LMA, the procedure is described below and demonstrated in the following video (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F110705\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef110705 \">movie 7</a>).

It appears similar to the LMA Classic or LMA Unique but has several important differences: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most importantly, the Air-Q was designed for blind or endoscopically-guided intubation using the ventilation lumen as a conduit. The large adult size of the Air-Q can accommodate a size 8.5 ETT. A small triangular ramp in the distal end of the lumen directs the ETT anteriorly into the glottic opening. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cuff is relatively stiff and designed so airway tissues mold around it, so less air is needed to inflate the cuff and there is less distention of airway structures. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Air-Q is designed for intubation using a standard ETT. The mild curvature of the device does not require a specialized non-kinking ETT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Removal of the Air-Q over the ETT is a straightforward process when using the Air-Q Removal Stylet, and does not put the pilot balloon at risk of tearing.</p><p/><p>The Air-Q is available in several models. The Air-Q Blocker (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F107856\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef107856 \">picture 12</a>) has greater tube stiffness to ease placement, increased sidewall rigidity to act as a bite block, and a built-in channel through which a proprietary esophageal catheter can be placed beyond the cuff to decrease the risk of aspiration.</p><p>The Air-Q SP model self-regulates cuff pressure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F103892\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103892 \">picture 14</a>). During a bagged breath, some air is routed through a short tube from the ventilation channel into the cuff to inflate it when a good glottic seal is required. During passive exhalation, air leaves the cuff into the ventilation lumen to decrease mucosal pressure and reduce distortion of tissues around the cuff.</p><p>Placement of the Air-Q placement involves a technique similar to that used for the LMA Classic, with the exception that the Air-Q does not need to ride against the palate during insertion. The cuff is stiff enough to insert without it touching pharyngeal structures. Once the Air-Q is seated at its natural stopping point, ventilation is assessed by bagging and an in-line end-tidal CO<sub>2 </sub>monitor. If a cuff leak is present, inflate the cuff with a small amount of air (&lt;5 mL). Up to 15 mL of air can be placed in the cuff if needed, while monitoring cuff pressure, which should be kept below 40 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. The following video demonstrates proper placement of the Air-Q (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F110717\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef110717 \">movie 8</a>).</p><p>Intubation through the Air-Q is similar to the LMA Fastrach. A standard (or Parker Flex-Tip) ETT can be used instead of a proprietary ETT because the shallow curve of the Air-Q does not require a non-kinking type of ETT. The procedure requires several steps and should be well practiced before it is performed on a patient.

When seated in the airway, they have a large pharyngeal balloon to seal the oropharynx, a small esophageal balloon to seal the esophagus, and a tube that passes posteriorly to the glottis and into the esophagus with lumens between the cuff balloons that align approximately with the glottic opening to provide oxygenation and ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extraglottic-devices-for-emergency-airway-management-in-adults/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. </p><p>Most complications from retroglottic airway devices stem from soft tissue trauma to the pharynx during placement. To avoid this, laryngeal tubes should be placed gently, or with a laryngoscope to open the airway and allow the device to pass into the esophagus without significant resistance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2365313113\"><span class=\"h2\">Combitube</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Combitube is a dual-lumen, dual-cuff airway designed for esophageal placement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73193\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73193 \">figure 4</a>). One cuff lies above the glottis and the other lies distal to the glottis in the esophagus, thereby isolating the laryngeal inlet and allowing for directed ventilation into the trachea. It has been used extensively for general anesthesia and has been studied in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extraglottic-devices-for-emergency-airway-management-in-adults/abstract/47,56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,56-58</a>]. Despite the documented success of the Combitube in difficult airway management, we prefer extraglottic devices that allow for the establishment of a cuffed endotracheal tube (ETT) in the trachea (ie, definitive airway). It is not possible to establish a definitive airway through the Combitube. </p><p>Insertion of the Combitube is a blind technique intended for providers who have not been trained in laryngoscopy. However, a laryngoscope may be used, permitting insertion under direct vision. Although the Combitube can be inserted in almost any patient position, including sitting and semi-prone, the technique described here assumes the patient is in the supine position and that a laryngoscope is not available.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With the patient supine and the head and neck in a neutral position, lift the tongue and jaw upward (jaw lift) with your non-dominant hand.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insert the Combitube in the midline, allowing the curve of the device to follow the natural curve of the airway, and advance the device until the upper incisors (or alveolar ridge if the patient is edentulous) lie between the imprinted black circular bands on the device.

However, the King LT is shorter than the Combitube, has one large lumen instead of two smaller ones, uses only one inflation valve to fill both cuffs, and has a straight distal segment &ndash; instead of the Combitube, which bends slightly anterior &ndash; so it almost never enters the trachea and instead goes consistently in the esophagus. </p><p>There is a first-generation King LT with a blind distal tip (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79762\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79762 \">picture 3</a>) and second-generation model with an open distal tip (King LTS) that permits gastric decompression. There are also single-use, disposable models (King LT-D and LTS-D).</p><p>The technique for inserting the King LT is similarly to that used for the Combitube. However, placement and troubleshooting are more straightforward. To insert, open the patient's mouth and place a well-lubricated King LT into the midline of the oropharynx using your dominant hand (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F107891\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef107891 \">movie 14</a>). Advance the King LT until definitive resistance is felt, or the colored 15-mm bag-connector flange touches the incisors. A single pilot balloon port is used to inflate both balloons simultaneously. Once seated, ventilation occurs through the ports between the two cuff balloons.</p><p>The first attempt at ventilation after insertion often results in no air movement and high resistance to ventilation. This is because the tube is too deep and the ventilation fenestrations lie within the proximal esophagus. In such case, the King LT should be withdrawn slowly, about 1cm at a time, with the cuffs inflated, while continuing to attempt ventilations. At some point, ventilations will immediately become possible as the fenestrations emerge above the posterior cricoid ring and oxygen enters the glottis. Once ventilations can be performed freely, the King LT should be pulled back another 1 to 2 cm to ensure good alignment of the ventilation fenestrations with the glottis, and prevent air from entering the esophagus. The King LT remains in this position without any further maneuvers, and ventilation and oxygenation via the King LT are generally excellent.</p><p>Studies performed on manikins, or in the operating room during management of controlled airways, show that time to ventilation and successful placement of the laryngeal tube is on a par with the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) and significantly faster than tracheal intubation using direct laryngoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extraglottic-devices-for-emergency-airway-management-in-adults/abstract/49-53,56,59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-53,56,59,60</a>].

The Aintree now maintains a path from the oropharynx into the trachea.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deflate the cuffs of the King LT and remove the King LT over the Aintree. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Railroad the ETT over the Aintree into the trachea. This is the same technique used with an endotracheal tube introducer (ETI, &quot;bougie&quot;) intubation. </p><p/><p>Alternatively, if the provider is using a disposable, single-use fiberoptic endoscope like the Ambu aScope, the fiberoptic endoscope can be advanced down the King LT into the trachea and the proximal end of the fiberoptic endoscope (as close as possible to the handle) cut with trauma shears, leaving the flexible tail of the fiberoptic endoscope as a &quot;railroad track&quot; from the oropharynx to the trachea. Then the King LT can be deflated and removed over the aScope tail, and an ETT railroaded over the aScope tail into the trachea. A series of photographs depicting this approach is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F107892\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef107892 \">picture 24</a>). Of note, other small-lumen EGDs that are not designed as a conduit for ETTs, such as the LMA Unique and LMA Classic, can be exchanged for a new ETT using these techniques.</p><p>Of note, other small-lumen EGDs that are not designed to act as a conduit for ETTs, such as the LMA Unique and LMA Classic, can be exchanged for an ETT using these techniques. A video of this technique can be found at the following <a href=\"http://emcrit.org/blogpost/stas-maneuver-changing-non-intubating-laryngeal-airway/&amp;token=idu9mpRLK3ie+hdtuaqQCMz7H1Ma6fc27IRNmiqrruqieIrTOXwR+8Irdbee1JKGT4beMT/rB5n/0T6Pgl0IRvjDKWuongsjdLzFgLkzvuI=&amp;TOPIC_ID=106475\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">website</a>.</p><p>With any type of fiberoptic endoscope, oxygenation and ventilation can be maintained for as long as the fiberoptic endoscope remains in place by using the bronchoscope swivel adapter. The aScope sequence can be seen in this picture sequence and video, without using a bronchoscope adapter. Of note, the shorter length and flexibility of the aScope compared with a standard bougie requires cutting the aScope as close as possible to the handle and removing the bag adapter from the ETT for the cut aScope tail to emerge easily from inside the ETT.</p><p>Practitioners are often tempted to insert an ETI blindly through the King LT lumen to &quot;find&quot; the trachea, but the steep angle at which the ETI exits the King LT does not usually allow smooth passage through the vocal cords. Instead, complications can arise and we do not recommend this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extraglottic-devices-for-emergency-airway-management-in-adults/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1637060290\"><span class=\"h2\">Rusch EasyTube</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Rusch EasyTube is a dual-lumen tube designed for emergency airway management. Like the Combitube, the EasyTube can be placed either in the esophagus (common) or trachea (rare). However, unlike the Combitube, if placed in the esophagus the EasyTube allows the passage of a fiberoptic endoscope through the ventilation lumen. Therefore, a procedure similar to that described above for the King LT or an Aintree catheter can be used to place an ETT using the EasyTube as a conduit. If the EasyTube is placed in the trachea, the size and shape of the distal tip are similar to a standard ETT. Additional evidence from human studies is needed to demonstrate the relative success rate of the EasyTube compared with the LMA, Combitube, or King LT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91292265\"><span class=\"h2\">Intubating Laryngeal Tube Suction Disposable (iLTS-D)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Intubating Laryngeal Tube Suction Disposable (iLTS-D) is the first laryngeal tube with the capability to serve as a conduit for tracheal intubation with a standard ETT. While promising, available clinical evidence to assess the performance of the iLTS-D is limited.</p><p>The device is similar to the King LT in that it has a single pilot balloon port through which both the oropharyngeal and the esophageal cuffs can be inflated. It is passed blindly in the midline of the oropharynx using a jaw thrust to facilitate placement. There is a mark on the iLTS-D that should be aligned with the patient's incisors. Once in position, the cuffs are inflated and ventilation confirmed. An orogastric (OG) tube may be inserted through a dedicated port on the device to decompress the stomach.</p><p>After adequate oxygenation and ventilation are confirmed, a standard ETT can be passed through the device into the trachea. This process is ideally performed under continuous visualization using a fiberoptic endoscope but may be attempted blindly, albeit with lower success rates. After confirming successful ETT placement, the iLTS-D may be removed by disconnecting the ETT bag connector, stabilizing the ETT, fully deflating the cuff on the iLTS-D, and removing the iLTS-D over the ETT. The iLTS-D is available in Europe and may soon be available in the United States.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2084793561\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extraglottic devices (EGDs) provide an airway for oxygenation and ventilation without entering the trachea. They can be used as either primary or rescue devices but do not provide a definitive airway that protects the trachea from obstruction or aspiration. A table summarizing the basic features of several common EGDs, including their location relative to the glottis and suitability for blind intubation, is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F106515\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106515 \">table 1</a>). Each of the devices listed is highly effective for providing oxygenation and ventilation. (See <a href=\"#H1996064488\" class=\"local\">'General indications and contraindications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3726927768\" class=\"local\">'Types of devices and their features'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indications for placing an EGD include the need for oxygenation and ventilation. Contraindications include presence of a gag reflex, trauma or disease of the oropharynx or proximal esophagus that predisposes to perforation or hemorrhage, and airway obstruction by a foreign body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EGDs are used frequently for primary airway management in patients in cardiac arrest, where they can be placed without causing interruptions in chest compressions, and as rescue devices after failed laryngoscopy until a definitive airway can be established. Particularly in emergency situations, it is important to use an EGD that can decompress the stomach and be used as a conduit for tracheal intubation. Most EGDs require only 2 cm of interdental space for placement; if a tracheal tube would fit, an EGD will fit. (See <a href=\"#H1884826990\" class=\"local\">'Use in emergency settings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several common EDGs are discussed in the text, including step by step instructions and video clips demonstrating the techniques for placement, intubation, and removal.
