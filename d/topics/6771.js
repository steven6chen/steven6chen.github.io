An overview of the approach to the patient with headache is presented here. The approach to adults presenting with headache in the emergency department is reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-headache-in-the-emergency-department\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with headache in the emergency department&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical features and management of specific primary headache syndromes are discussed separately.

While episodic tension-type headache is the most frequent headache type in population-based studies, migraine is the most common diagnosis in patients presenting to primary care physicians with headache. The one-year prevalence of episodic tension-type headache (TTH) is approximately 65 percent (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tension-type headache in adults: Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>), but most people with tension-type headache do not present to physicians for care. As an example, a study of two primary care units in Brazil found that migraine was the most prevalent primary headache disorder, accounting for 45 percent of patients reporting headache as a single symptom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-headache-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Cluster headache typically leads to significant disability and most of these patients will come to medical attention. However, cluster headache remains an uncommon diagnosis in primary care settings because of overall low prevalence in the general population (&lt;1 percent). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cluster-headache-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cluster headache: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>Clinicians can easily become familiar with the most common primary headache disorders and how to distinguish them (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F68064\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68064 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1294899476\"><span class=\"h2\">Migraine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Migraine is a disorder of recurrent attacks. The headache of migraine is often but not always unilateral and tends to have a throbbing or pulsatile quality. Accompanying features may include nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia during attacks. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of migraine in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Migraine trigger factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F57424\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57424 \">table 2</a>) may include stress, menstruation, visual stimuli, weather changes, nitrates, fasting, wine, sleep disturbances, and aspartame, among others.

Pure TTH is a rather featureless headache. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tension-type headache in adults: Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1294899586\"><span class=\"h2\">Cluster headache</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cluster headache belongs to a group of idiopathic headache entities, the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F65541\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65541 \">table 3</a>), all of which involve unilateral, often severe headache attacks and typical accompanying autonomic symptoms. Cluster headache is characterized by attacks of severe unilateral orbital, supraorbital, or temporal pain accompanied by autonomic phenomena. Unilateral autonomic symptoms are ipsilateral to the pain and may include ptosis, miosis, lacrimation, conjunctival injection, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion. Attacks usually last 15 to 180 minutes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cluster-headache-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cluster headache: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Cluster headache may sometimes be confused with a life-threatening headache, since the pain from a cluster headache can reach full intensity within minutes. However, cluster headache is transient, usually lasting less than one to two hours.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1639554284\"><span class=\"h2\">Secondary headache</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physicians who evaluate patients with headache should be alert to signs that suggest a serious underlying disorder. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Danger signs'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1383347429\" class=\"local\">'Patient settings'</a> below.)</p><p>In the Brazilian primary care study, 39 percent of patients presenting with headache had a headache that was due to a systemic disorder (most commonly fever, acute hypertension, and sinusitis), and 5 percent had a headache that was due to a neurologic disorder (most commonly post-traumatic headache, headaches secondary to cervical spine disease, and expansive intracranial processes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-headache-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1639554503\"><span class=\"h2\">Misconceptions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of misconceptions may hinder headache evaluation and diagnosis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although sinus headache is commonly diagnosed by physicians and self-diagnosed by patients, acute or chronic sinusitis appears to be an uncommon cause of recurrent headaches, and many patients presenting with sinus headache turn out to have migraine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-headache-in-adults/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1639554570\" class=\"local\">'Sinus symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients frequently attribute headaches to eye strain. However, an observational study suggested that headaches are only rarely due to refractive error alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-headache-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Nevertheless, correcting vision may improve headache symptoms in some of these patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a common belief, particularly among patients, that hypertension can cause headaches. While this is true in the case of hypertensive emergencies, it is probably not true for typical migraine or tension headaches. As an example, a report from the Physicians' Health Study of 22,701 American male physicians ages 40 to 84 years analyzed various risk factors for cerebrovascular disease and found no difference in the percentage of men with a history of hypertension in the migraine and nonmigraine groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-headache-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Furthermore, a prospective study of 22,685 adults in Norway found that high systolic and diastolic pressures were actually associated with a reduced risk of nonmigrainous headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-headache-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The appropriate evaluation of headache complaints includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rule out serious underlying pathology and look for other secondary causes of headache (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F107496\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef107496 \">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determine the type of primary headache using the patient history as the primary diagnostic tool (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F68064\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68064 \">table 1</a>).

Gait examination should include getting up from a seated position without any support and walking on tiptoes and heels, tandem gait, and Romberg test.</p><p>The majority of patients with headache complaints have a completely normal physical and neurologic examination.

However, there may be considerable symptom overlap; one population-based survey found that less than one-half of patients who complained of headaches that met criteria for migraine were properly diagnosed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-headache-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Migraine symptoms may also overlap with other causes of headache. As an example, a significant number of patients with migraine may have nasal symptoms that suggest sinus disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-headache-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]; in addition, a study of primary care patients with recurrent sinus headache found that 90 percent experienced attacks that met the International Headache Society (IHS) criteria for migraine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-headache-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1639554570\" class=\"local\">'Sinus symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p>Given these pitfalls, a number of diagnostic instruments have been proposed, mainly to assist with the diagnosis of migraine, the most common primary headache syndrome in patients presenting to primary care physicians. One such instrument (ID Migraine) preselects eligible subjects as those who had two or more headaches in the previous three months and indicated either that they might want to speak with a healthcare professional about their headaches or that they experienced a headache that limited their ability to work, study, or enjoy life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-headache-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The screen employs three questions:</p><p>During the last three months, did you have the following with your headaches?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You felt nauseated or sick to your stomach</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Light bothered you (a lot more than when you don't have headaches)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your headaches limited your ability to work, study, or do what you needed to do for at least one day</p><p/><p>The ID migraine screen is positive if the patient answers yes to two of the three items. In a systematic review of 13 studies that involved over 5800 patients, the pooled sensitivity and specificity of ID migraine was 0.84 and 0.76, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-headache-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A positive ID migraine increased the pretest probability of migraine from 59 to 84 percent, whereas a negative ID Migraine score reduced the probability of migraine from 59 to 23 percent.</p><p>Another simple and validated instrument, the brief headache screen, consists of three to six questions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-headache-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. One version includes the following four questions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How often do you get severe headaches (ie, without treatment it is difficult to function)?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How often do you get other (milder) headaches?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How often do you take headache relievers or pain pills?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has there been any recent change in your headaches?</p><p/><p>In one study, the presence of episodic disabling headache correctly identified migraine in 136 of 146 patients (93 percent) with episodic migraine, and 154 of 197 patients (78 percent) with chronic headache with migraine, with a specificity of 63 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-headache-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Only 6 of 343 patients (2 percent) with migraine were not identified by disabling headache. Thus, virtually any patient with severe episodic headaches can be considered to have migraine.</p><p>Questions 2 and 3 can be helpful for identifying patients with medication overuse (eg, patients who use symptomatic medications more than three days per week <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> who have daily headaches). Question 4 is particularly helpful for identifying patients who may have an important secondary cause of headache; a patient with a stable pattern of headache for six months is unlikely to have a serious underlying cause.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with any of the danger signs noted above need urgent brain imaging (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Danger signs'</a> above). Our approach is to perform neuroimaging in the following situations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-headache-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focal neurologic signs or symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Onset of headache with exertion, cough, or sexual activity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Orbital bruit</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Onset of headache after age 40 years</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recent significant change in the pattern, frequency, or severity of headaches</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progressive worsening of headache despite appropriate therapy</p><p/><p>MRI is the preferred brain imaging modality for most patients because it is more sensitive than CT scan for detecting edema, vascular lesions, and other types of intracranial pathology, particularly in the posterior fossa. However, CT is more widely available and is therefore more useful in urgent or emergency care situations when there is concern for subarachnoid hemorrhage as the cause of thunderclap headache.</p><p>It may also be reasonable to image a patient presenting with nonmigrainous featureless headache, ie, bilateral nonthrobbing headache without nausea and without sensitivity to light, sound, or smell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-headache-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Such an approach would have an estimated yield of 2 percent for detecting a treatable cause.</p><p>In the remaining patients, there are no randomized, controlled trials that help delineate when imaging is necessary, and no such trials are likely to be forthcoming as blinding and randomization would present ethical problems. As a result, the decision to scan or not to scan in headache is likely to remain one of clinical judgment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-headache-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>The vast majority of patients without danger signs do not have a secondary cause of headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-headache-in-adults/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. As an example, in a study of 373 patients with chronic headache at a tertiary referral center, all had one or more of the following characteristics that prompted referral for head CT scanning: increased severity of symptoms or resistance to appropriate drug therapy, change in characteristics or pattern of headache, or family history of an intracranial structural lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-headache-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Only four scans (1 percent) showed significant lesions (two osteomas, one low grade glioma, and one aneurysm); only the aneurysm was treated.</p><p>Neuroimaging is usually not warranted for patients with migraine and a normal neurologic examination, although a lower threshold for imaging is reasonable for patients with atypical migraine features or in patients who do not fulfill the strict definition of migraine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-headache-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, brain imaging for no other reason than reassurance is sometimes performed in clinical practice. In the end, patients are seeking a reason for the problem. It is important that the clinician provide the patient with a clear explanation of both the diagnosis and the reason for the brain scan, especially if the decision is made to obtain imaging in someone suspected of having primary headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-headache-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for lumbar puncture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lumbar puncture (LP) for cerebrospinal fluid analysis is urgently indicated in patients with headache when there is clinical suspicion of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the setting of a negative or normal head CT scan.
