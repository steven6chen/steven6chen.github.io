The condition does not usually cause symptoms. It happens when fatty deposits called plaque buildup inside blood vessels called the &quot;carotid arteries.&quot; These are the 2 main blood vessels that bring blood to the brain. When plaque forms in these arteries, the arteries can become narrow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F72617\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72617 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25724331\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of carotid artery disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Carotid artery disease can cause strokes and TIAs (described below), though it does not always cause symptoms.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Strokes</strong> &ndash; A stroke is when a part of the brain is damaged because of a problem with blood flow. Carotid artery disease can lead to strokes, because blood clots can form inside the narrowed artery. Then the clots and other material from the fatty plaque can travel to the brain and clog smaller arteries.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some people recover from strokes without lasting effects or with only minor problems. But many people have serious problems after a stroke. After a stroke, some people are:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Unable to speak or understand speech</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Paralyzed on one side of their body</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Unable to dress, feed, or take care of themselves</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>TIAs</strong> &ndash; TIA stands for &quot;transient ischemic attack.&quot; TIAs are basically strokes that last only a short time. But they do not cause brain damage. TIAs happen when a blood vessel in the brain gets clogged briefly and then reopens. People who have TIAs can have the symptoms of a stroke, but the symptoms go away in a short time. People who have TIAs are at very high risk of having a full-blown stroke.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25724338\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for carotid artery disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Doctors can listen to each carotid artery with a stethoscope. They do this to check for a swishing sound that occurs when the artery is partly blocked. But to be sure, doctors also can use one of the following tests, which create pictures of the arteries:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Carotid duplex ultrasound</strong> &ndash; This test uses sound waves to create pictures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)</strong> &ndash; This test uses a magnet to create pictures. It works the same way that MRI tests work. Before having MRA, most people get an injection of a dye that makes the arteries show up more clearly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Computed tomography angiography (CTA)</strong> &ndash; This test uses a special kind of X-ray called a CT scan. Before having the scan, people get an injection of a dye that makes the arteries show up more clearly.</p><p/><p>There is another test that doctors sometimes use, called a &quot;cerebral angiogram.&quot; But that is not usually necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25724345\"><span class=\"h1\">How is carotid artery disease treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments for carotid artery disease focus mostly on preventing stroke. Treatments can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lifestyle changes</strong> &ndash; People can reduce their risk of stroke by:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Quitting smoking if they smoke</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Being active</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Losing weight if they are overweight</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Eating a diet low in fat and cholesterol and high in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy foods</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medicines</strong> &ndash; Different people need different medicines to reduce their chances of having a stroke. In general, the medicines that can help prevent strokes include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Medicines to lower blood pressure</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Medicines called statins, which lower cholesterol</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Medicines to prevent blood clots, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Surgery</strong> &ndash; Doctors can do surgery to remove plaque from the carotid arteries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F52730\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52730 \">figure 2</a>). This is called &quot;carotid endarterectomy.&quot; This treatment is most appropriate for people who have had a TIA or stroke caused by plaque in one of their carotid arteries.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Carotid stenting</strong> &ndash; Carotid stenting is when doctors insert a tiny metal tube called a &quot;stent&quot; into the carotid artery. The stent is designed to prop open narrowed arteries. This treatment seems to be more risky than surgery for people age 70 or older.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25724352\"><span class=\"h1\">Which treatment is right for me?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The right treatment for you will depend on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether you have already had a stroke or TIA caused by carotid artery disease</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How much of your carotid artery is blocked off by plaque</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How old you are</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether you are a man or a woman</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether you have other health problems besides carotid artery disease</p><p/><p>If your doctor suggests surgery or stenting, ask these questions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the chances that I will have a stroke in the next 5 years if I <strong>do not</strong> have this procedure?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How much will the procedure reduce my risk of having a stroke in the next 5 years?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the risks of the procedure?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the doctor who will do the procedure have a lot of experience?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25724432\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High blood pressure in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-cholesterol-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High cholesterol (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=doppler-ultrasound-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Doppler ultrasound (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vagal-maneuvers-and-their-responses-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vagal maneuvers and their responses (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
