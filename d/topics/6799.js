Patients likely to have essential (idiopathic or primary) hypertension undergo a relatively limited evaluation because extensive laboratory testing is usually of little value. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-of-the-hypertensive-adult\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation of the hypertensive adult&quot;</a>.)</p><p>By contrast, patients who have clinical clues suggesting the possible presence of secondary hypertension should undergo a more extensive evaluation. If secondary hypertension is present, the most effective treatment strategy often is one that is focused upon the specific mechanism underlying the hypertension. In addition, some of these disorders can be cured, leading to partial or complete normalization of the blood pressure.</p><p>Because it is not cost effective to perform a complete evaluation for secondary hypertension in every hypertensive patient, it is important to be aware of the clinical clues that suggest secondary hypertension. The identification of patients who should undergo an evaluation for secondary hypertension will be reviewed here.

The incidence varies with the clinical setting. It probably occurs in less than 1 percent of patients with mild hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-secondary-hypertension/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. By comparison, between 10 and 45 percent of white patients with severe or malignant hypertension have renal artery stenosis. Renal artery stenosis can be detected in many individuals with other manifestations of atherosclerosis, such as coronary artery disease (10 to 14 percent) and peripheral arterial and aortic disease (24 to 35 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-secondary-hypertension/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>For reasons that are not well understood, renovascular disease is less commonly identified in black patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-secondary-hypertension/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. As an example, the prevalence of renal artery stenosis in high-risk patients with severe or refractory hypertension was 27 to 45 percent in whites, compared with 8 to 19 percent in blacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-secondary-hypertension/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A more extreme disparity was found in a retrospective review of all patients diagnosed with renal artery stenosis at a single center, 95 percent of whom were white [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-secondary-hypertension/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, two studies that prospectively screened individuals with or without clinical clues for renovascular hypertension found similar rates of renal artery stenosis in blacks and whites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-secondary-hypertension/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Referral bias is a possible explanation for this discrepancy, given that blacks diagnosed with renal artery stenosis were more likely than whites to have severe or refractory hypertension and a history of stroke or myocardial infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-secondary-hypertension/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>There are a variety of findings associated with a higher likelihood of hypertension being secondary to renovascular disease. The 2011 American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC/AHA)</span> guidelines on peripheral artery disease and the 2014 consensus statement from the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions propose that diagnostic testing for renal artery stenosis could be performed in the following settings, assuming that a corrective procedure would be considered if renovascular disease were detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-secondary-hypertension/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. As with other vascular diseases, long-term management of these patients can be affected by the potential for progressive vascular occlusion. Recommendations for selecting patients for renal artery revascularization are presented elsewhere.

In a series of 55 patients with renovascular hypertension, for example, 23 percent had recurrent episodes of pulmonary edema requiring hospitalization. Flash pulmonary edema was more common in patients with bilateral compared with unilateral renal artery stenosis. The factors that contribute to acute decompensation include a hypertension-induced increase in afterload, inability of a hypertrophied left ventricle to relax in diastole (ie, diastolic with or without systolic dysfunction), sodium retention due to activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and associated renal dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-secondary-hypertension/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Registry data from the United Kingdom indicate that patients with episodes of pulmonary edema and renal artery stenosis have a benefit of reduced mortality after successful renal revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-secondary-hypertension/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Systolic bruits alone are more sensitive but less specific [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-secondary-hypertension/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The patient should be supine, moderate pressure should be placed on the diaphragm of the stethoscope, and auscultation should be performed in the epigastrium and all four abdominal quadrants.</p><p/><p>In summary, radiologic testing to confirm the presence of renal artery stenosis <strong>may</strong> be indicated in patients for whom the history is suggestive (based upon a general assessment of clinical risk factors) <strong>and</strong> in whom a corrective procedure will be performed if renovascular disease is detected or progresses. There is little value and potential harm from radiologic testing if the patient is not a candidate for a corrective procedure. Imaging methods for renovascular hypertension, and how one makes the choice between medical and interventional therapy in such patients, are discussed elsewhere.

However, more than one-half of patients have a normal serum potassium concentration at detection, and, therefore, nearly all patients with suspected secondary hypertension should be evaluated for primary aldosteronism. Primary aldosteronism should also be suspected in the presence of slight hypernatremia, drug-resistant hypertension, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypertension with an adrenal incidentaloma.

These patients have repeated apneic episodes at night due to passive collapse of the pharyngeal muscles during inspiration, such that the airway becomes temporarily occluded from the apposition of the tongue and soft palate against the posterior oropharynx. A variety of other symptoms may be seen, including headache, daytime somnolence and fatigue, morning confusion with difficulty in concentration, personality changes, depression, persistent systemic hypertension, and potentially life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias.

Patients identified with pheochromocytoma are rarely asymptomatic. In addition, patients with drug-resistant hypertension and those with an adrenal incidentaloma should be evaluated for pheochromocytoma. Other patients with suspected secondary hypertension who do not have these symptoms or an adrenal incidentaloma should not be evaluated for this rare cause of hypertension.
