Stage one is caused by impaired intestinal calcium absorption, resulting in hypocalcemia, whereas serum inorganic phosphorus is normal. Hypophosphatemia develops in stages two and three, coinciding with clinically apparent rickets. Serum calcium is normal in stage two because of a compensatory increase in PTH secretion, but becomes low again in stage three, when the hyperparathyroidism is unable to compensate for the severe restriction in available calcium, and the clinical and radiological findings of rickets are severe. Because later stages of the disorder are characterized by severe secondary hyperparathyroidism, hyperaminoaciduria and hyperphosphaturia may occur. </p><p>The clinical features of and diagnostic evaluation for hypocalcemic rickets are discussed separately.

This is particularly important in patients with elevated levels of PTH, to avoid the so-called &quot;hungry bone&quot; syndrome (worsening hypocalcemia after the start of vitamin D therapy). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Global Consensus Recommendations suggest somewhat higher doses for infants (vitamin D 2000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-treatment-of-calcipenic-rickets-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, because of risks of inducing hypercalcemia in small infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-treatment-of-calcipenic-rickets-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], we suggest the lower doses outlined above, and emphasize the need to perform biochemical monitoring. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This regimen of vitamin D and calcium supplementation should lead to resolution of the biochemical and radiological abnormalities within three months. We repeat the biochemical evaluation within one month of starting therapy, for safety reasons, and we check radiographs for evidence of healing after two to three months of treatment.

The Global Consensus prefers daily therapy rather than stoss therapy, but recognizes that stoss therapy is sometimes more practical, and provides the following dosing recommendations, using oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d3-cholecalciferol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vitamin D3</a> (cholecalciferol), and not <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d2-ergocalciferol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vitamin D2</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-treatment-of-calcipenic-rickets-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Infants &lt;3 months of age &ndash; stoss therapy not recommended</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Infants 3 to 12 months of age &ndash; a single dose of 50,000 international units </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Children 1 to 12 years &ndash; a single dose of 150,000 international units</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Children &ge; 12 years &ndash; a single dose of 300,000 international units</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This amount of vitamin D should be sufficient to induce healing of the growth plate within three months. Stoss therapy may be advantageous when compliance with therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> follow-up is anticipated to be a problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-treatment-of-calcipenic-rickets-in-children/abstract/5,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,24</a>]. However, high doses of vitamin D may lead to hypercalcemia. Finally, in older children, a modified higher dose approach has been successfully used, particularly when there is concern about adherence to a daily regimen. The regimen consists of weekly doses of 50,000 int. units vitamin D for two to three months. Adequate calcium intake should also be assured when using stoss therapy (as with daily therapy). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vitamin D deficiency without rickets</strong> &ndash; Expert opinion varies regarding doses for vitamin D replacement in infants and children with serum levels of 25OHD less than 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (50 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L),</span> but without clinical evidence of rickets. Some authorities recommend the same dosing scheme that is used for children with rickets, as outlined above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-treatment-of-calcipenic-rickets-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In our own practice, we tend to use somewhat lower doses (400 int. units daily in children less than one month of age, and up to 1000 int. units daily for older children). We feel that this reduces the risk of inducing hypercalcemia, especially in children who may not reliably return for biochemical monitoring after one month of therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents#H16834525\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase concentrations, and urinary <span class=\"nowrap\">calcium/creatinine</span> ratio should be measured four weeks after the start of therapy in children who are being treated for vitamin D-deficiency rickets. At this time point, serum calcium and phosphorus levels should have normalized, and alkaline phosphatase should have started to decrease towards the reference range. The urinary <span class=\"nowrap\">calcium/creatinine</span> ratio may still be low. These tests should be repeated monthly until doses are adjusted downward to a typical daily replacement amount. This typically occurs by three months of therapy, at which time radiographs can be obtained to document the healing of rachitic lesions. </p><p>Orthopedic consultation usually is not indicated because skeletal deformities regress completely after successful medical therapy. Correction of bow defects is a more chronic process and may take months to years to correct after the radiologic appearance of the growth plates has normalized. Orthopedic intervention may be necessary if deformities do not eventually improve. </p><p>If the radiographs do not show evidence of healing, or biochemical parameters are not improving, the possibility of poor adherence to treatment, malabsorption of vitamin D, or other forms of rickets should be considered. Consideration of an alternate diagnosis is particularly important when the original biochemical profile had borderline values. As an example, modest elevations in serum PTH are occasionally observed in X-linked hyperphosphatemia (XLH), leading to an erroneous diagnosis of calcipenic rickets. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-rickets-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of rickets in children&quot;</a>.) </p><p>An additional biochemical parameter of the adequacy of calcium and vitamin D supplementation that may be useful in older children is the reappearance of normal levels of urinary calcium excretion showing that the body's vitamin D and calcium stores have been replenished. If the patient has no detectable calciuria after three months of treatment, continuation of the same treatment regimen for another three months is advisable.</p><p>Monitoring is also important as to ensure that no toxicity has occurred, particularly if the vitamin D dose was erroneously dispensed or administered. We have encountered hypercalcemia in the setting where high doses were continued for a longer duration than intended due to poor compliance with follow-up visits. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Calcium deficiency</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Etiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rickets can occur despite adequate vitamin D levels if calcium intake is very low. This problem generally does not occur unless calcium intake is very low because vitamin D increases intestinal calcium absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-treatment-of-calcipenic-rickets-in-children/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Most children with calcium deficiency rickets have normal serum 25OHD and high serum 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D concentrations, indicating adequate intake of vitamin D. These children may have an increased vitamin D requirement when measured by their response to vitamin D replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-treatment-of-calcipenic-rickets-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Thus, vitamin D requirements may be higher than expected in children who are calcium-deficient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-treatment-of-calcipenic-rickets-in-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Indeed, the turnover of vitamin D is accelerated in the setting of calcium deficiency. Thus, the two nutrients are inherently linked such that limited availability of one will result in limited supply of the other.</p><p>Calcium-deficiency rickets was well documented in a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of 123 Nigerian children with rickets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-treatment-of-calcipenic-rickets-in-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In this population, the baseline intake of calcium was very low (about 200 mg per day), and the children responded to treatment with calcium, with or without vitamin D [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-treatment-of-calcipenic-rickets-in-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

This may be caused by dietary deficiency of calcium, or by insufficient intestinal absorption of calcium caused by vitamin D deficiency or decreased vitamin D activity (eg, lack of conversion to the active metabolite or resistance to the active metabolite). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Calcipenic rickets is characterized by elevated parathyroid hormone and normal or low serum inorganic phosphorus concentrations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79880\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef79880 \">algorithm 1</a>). Measurement of the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) level helps to categorize the disorder into one of the following subcategories, which are discussed in detail in this topic review (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80602\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef80602 \">algorithm 2</a>).

The main reasons for inadequate vitamin D supply in infants from Western countries are prolonged breastfeeding without vitamin D supplementation and concomitant avoidance of sun exposure. Vitamin D deficiency may also be caused by conditions that cause malabsorption such as celiac disease, cystic fibrosis, or extensive bowel resection. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To prevent vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D supplementation (400 international units [int. <span class=\"nowrap\">units]/day)</span> is recommended for all breast-fed infants; supplementation should start in the first week of life. Supplements should be continued until the infant is ingesting at least 400 int. units of vitamin D daily through formula, milk, or other food sources. In addition, vitamin D supplementation should be given to all non-breastfed infants who are ingesting less than 1000 mL of vitamin D-fortified formula or milk per day. Children older than one year of age and adolescents should receive 600 int. units of vitamin D daily through diet (eg, 1000 mL vitamin D-fortified milk daily) or supplements (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants and children with any stage of vitamin D-deficiency rickets should be treated with vitamin D.
