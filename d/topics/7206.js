To illustrate, an operating room used solely for eye examinations under anesthesia, for which bleeding control is not likely to be a concern and no ignition sources would ever be used has a lower risk than a procedure room in a remote location out of the operating room that might be used for some interventions with fire risk factors. The most current National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 99 Health Care Facilities Code stratifies risk for activities, equipment, and preventive measures in facilities according to potential outcomes that would result from system failures:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Category 1 &mdash; If failure occurs, major injury or death to patients, staff, or visitors is likely.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Category 2 &mdash; If failure occurs, minor injury to patients, staff, or visitors is likely.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Category 3 &mdash; If failure occurs, injuries are not likely, but minor discomfort to patients, staff, or visitors is likely.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Category 4 &mdash; If failure occurs, no impact to patients, staff, or visitors would occur.</p><p/><p>Since category 1 is the default and has the most stringent requirements, no formal assessment is needed. However, a formal assessment by a multi-disciplinary team of engineers, clinical personnel, and other stakeholders should take place if a facility requests a code designation of category 2, 3, or 4 for a specific location. Such risk assessment is useful for a facility using certain locations for types of procedures that may not need the systems and redundancies in a Category 1 operating room [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fire-safety-in-the-operating-room/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. <a href=\"http://www.ashe.org/resources/riskassessmenttool.shtml&amp;token=LiWTIML1n3WTL1e8jRs1EKA0fGwtPzKxdOUQUbzm/ibJScv0Aa37S2eXRAQmz7U3ELmbimBe9Wz/II4XiTrujA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=94592\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">The American Society of Healthcare Engineering (ASHE)</a> has online tools to assist in the risk stratification process. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2117400322\"><span class=\"h2\">Education</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All persons working in the surgical environment should receive training regarding OR fire prevention and management.

Also, the user should consider that water-based extinguishers are large, heavy (approximately 30 pounds), and difficult to manage because they contain enough water volume to allow multiple attempts to extinguish a fire. Practice with extinguisher use during a drill can be helpful in providing familiarity with the type of extinguisher provided by the institution.</p><p>Dry chemical fire extinguishers are avoided not only because they are unsafe for internal exposure, but they are also associated with health concerns for OR personnel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F103375\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103375 \">table 3</a>).
