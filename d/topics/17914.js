In geographic locations where human rabies is rare, the diagnosis may not be considered until relatively late in the clinical course. There is no known effective treatment for rabies. </p><p>Although rabies is usually preventable after recognized exposures with post-exposure rabies prophylaxis (eg, wound cleansing and administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabies-virus-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rabies vaccine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabies-immune-globulin-human-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rabies immune globulin</a>), the need for prophylaxis is not always recognized and may not be readily available in some areas. In addition, human rabies may present without a history of an animal exposure, usually because a bat bite was not recognized. </p><p>This topic will address the approach to managing patients with suspected or confirmed rabies. The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and prevention of rabies are discussed elsewhere.

As of June 2017, there have been 15 well-documented rabies survivors as described in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F113372\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113372 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rabies/abstract/2-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-19</a>]. These cases do not include patients who had atypical features of rabies without the development of rabies virus neutralizing antibodies (since they were likely not cases of rabies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rabies/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>] or reports that did not have sufficient documentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rabies/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. </p><p>Many factors influence the therapeutic approach in patients with rabies, including prognostic factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F113371\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113371 \">table 2</a>) and the risks of treatment (see <a href=\"#H1245372966\" class=\"local\">'Combination therapies'</a> below). Although the relative importance of each of these factors is uncertain, in general:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A palliative approach is typically pursued in patients who are unlikely to survive or who would not accept survival with severe neurological sequelae. Factors associated with a poor prognosis include older age, comorbid conditions, late disease, no history of rabies vaccination, infection caused by dog rabies virus, and diagnostic testing that is positive for rabies virus <span class=\"nowrap\">antigen/RNA</span> and negative for neutralizing anti-rabies antibodies. (See <a href=\"#H3173059113\" class=\"local\">'Palliative approach'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consideration of an aggressive approach would be reasonable for patients who have an increased likelihood of survival and who would accept severe neurologic sequelae. Factors that may be associated with a more favorable disease course include young age, lack of comorbidities, receipt of one or more doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabies-virus-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rabies vaccine</a> prior to the onset of symptoms or signs, clinical manifestations consistent with early disease, infection caused by bat rabies virus, and diagnostic testing that is negative for rabies virus <span class=\"nowrap\">antigen/RNA</span> and positive for neutralizing anti-rabies antibodies.

An aggressive treatment approach involves a combination of supportive care and the off-label use of presently available therapies, which, although unproven, may have benefit based upon our current understanding of the disease. An improved understanding of basic mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of rabies may provide insights for the future development of novel therapies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies#H2006933\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rabies&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4278492965\"><span class=\"h2\">Supportive care in a critical care unit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Supportive care in a critical care unit is essential for an aggressive approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rabies/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

However, similar to the therapeutic approach to cancer, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and chronic hepatitis C virus infection, the use of a combination of therapies may have the best chance of success in treating rabies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rabies/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. This involves combining treatments in different therapeutic categories (eg, immunotherapy, antiviral therapy, and neuroprotective therapy) as described below. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H930700961\"><span class=\"h3\">Immunotherapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunotherapy with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabies-virus-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rabies vaccine</a> or human <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabies-immune-globulin-human-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rabies immune globulin</a> is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rabies/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, all but one patient who survived rabies infection received one or more doses of rabies vaccine before the onset of symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F113372\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113372 \">table 1</a>). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabies-virus-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rabies vaccine</a> &ndash; It is reasonable to administer rabies vaccine if the patient has not received a complete course of post-exposure prophylaxis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabies-immune-globulin-and-vaccine\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rabies immune globulin and vaccine&quot;</a>). Viral clearance in rabies is associated with the development of an immune response, and an important hallmark of this response is the presence of neutralizing anti-rabies virus antibodies in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rabies/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, it is unknown if it is advantageous to give <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabies-virus-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rabies vaccine</a> to a patient with rabies. Inactivated rabies vaccines do not elicit a cytotoxic T-cell response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rabies/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], and therefore their value for viral clearance may be limited. No live attenuated rabies vaccines are licensed for use in humans. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Human </strong><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabies-immune-globulin-human-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rabies immune globulin</a><strong> (HRIG)</strong> &ndash; HRIG is not routinely administered to patients with rabies because immunoglobulins do not cross an intact blood-brain barrier, and therefore, it is unknown to what extent immunoglobulins would facilitate viral clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rabies/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In animal models of rabies, there is limitation of entry of immune effector cells across the blood-brain barrier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rabies/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, the use of HRIG in conjunction with a strategy to enhance drug delivery into the central nervous system (CNS) (eg, osmotic agents or ultrasound waves) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rabies/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>] may be beneficial. The efficacy and safety of intrathecal administration of HRIG are unknown.

Antiviral therapy is used despite the lack of evidence supporting the efficacy of any available agent. Since there are no data to suggest one agent over the other, the approach to therapy is solely opinion based and is often influenced by which toxicities the provider and the patient (or the patient's family) are willing to accept.</p><p>Three agents (interferon-alfa, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amantadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amantadine</a>) have been used in the treatment of adults with rabies. These agents have been associated with neuropsychiatric, hematologic, gastrointestinal, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> autoimmune complications. A fourth drug, favipiravir, has shown efficacy in animal studies but is not approved for human use in most countries (including the United States and Canada). </p><p>If interferon-alfa is used, it should be administered intrathecally (eg, with at least 300,000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/day)</span> via a lumbar infusion or an intraventricular infusion (eg, with an Ommaya reservoir). CNS penetration may be limited with intravenous or intramuscular administration. Since there are concerns about CNS penetration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a>, if used, it should also be administered intrathecally or with an agent to enhance CNS penetration, if possible. (See <a href=\"#H3897837275\" class=\"local\">'Drug delivery into the central nervous system'</a> below.)</p><p>Studies of specific antiviral agents include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Interferon-alfa</strong> &ndash; Rabies virus triggers an innate immune response after entering the nervous system, which includes a type I interferon <span class=\"nowrap\">(interferon-alpha/beta)</span> response that limits viral spread. Although early reports of combined intramuscular and intrathecal administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rabies/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>] and combined intravenous and intrathecal administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rabies/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>] did not show a beneficial effect on the progression of the clinical disease in humans with rabies, there is some efficacy of interferon therapy in cell culture and animal models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rabies/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ribavirin</a> &ndash; Ribavirin is a broad-spectrum antiviral agent that is a purine analogue and RNA mutagen. Ribavirin has <em>in vitro</em> activity against rabies virus infection but no demonstrated efficacy in mouse models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rabies/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].

Because ribavirin is known to shift the immune response toward a Th1-type inflammatory response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rabies/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>], and because of the importance of a balanced <span class=\"nowrap\">Th1/Th2</span> immune response for the clearance of rabies virus infection, there are concerns that ribavirin could suppress antibody production essential for recovery from rabies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rabies/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amantadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amantadine</a> &ndash; Amantadine is a synthetic antiviral agent that can inhibit <em>in vitro</em> replication of certain viruses, including rabies virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rabies/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>].

Hence, there is little evidence to indicate that amantadine will be a useful therapeutic agent for the treatment of human rabies despite its inclusion in the Milwaukee protocol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rabies/abstract/19,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,44</a>].

Efficacy for <em>in vitro</em> studies in rabies virus infection and in mouse model studies for post-exposure rabies prophylaxis has been demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rabies/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>], but not for the therapy of rabies.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H243307772\"><span class=\"h3\">Neuroprotective therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neuroprotective therapies produce enduring benefits by favorably influencing the underlying etiology or pathogenesis and forestalling onset of disease or clinical decline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rabies/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The development of neuroprotective therapies for acute neurologic disorders remains in its infancy despite many published research studies. </p><p>There are no known effective neuroprotective agents for use in rabies. However, therapeutic (induced) brain hypothermia (targeted temperature management), administered with either a cooling helmet or intranasal cooling, could be considered as a potential adjunctive therapy for rabies in order to slow progression of the disease, reduce neuronal injury, and provide time for the development of an immune response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rabies/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Brain hypothermia is the only effective neuroprotective therapy demonstrated for acute brain injury in witnessed cardiac arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rabies/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>] and is used in clinical practice for this indication, although some evidence suggests further studies should be done to confirm efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rabies/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>Early studies suggested that the noncompetitive <em>N</em>-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> might be a promising neuroprotective therapy for rabies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rabies/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>], but subsequent work performed <em>in vitro</em> and in a mouse model of rabies failed to show efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rabies/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. In addition, ketamine was used in the Milwaukee protocol, which, after the initial case report, was not found to be successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rabies/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

Given the potential adverse effects and complications of therapeutic coma (eg, vasopressor dependency, increased risk of infection, association with intensive care unit mortality and complications), this strategy should <strong>not</strong> be used for the management of rabies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rabies/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2950949931\"><span class=\"h4\">Prophylaxis of cerebral vasospasm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prophylactic use of the calcium channel antagonist <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nimodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nimodipine</a>, vitamin C, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sapropterin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sapropterin</a> supplementation, and L-arginine for cerebral vasospasm are not recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rabies/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

In addition, it is unlikely that vasospasm plays an important role in the pathogenesis of rabies encephalitis.

There are a variety of strategies that have been taken to allow drugs to cross these barriers, including the use of a prodrug to improve entry into the CNS or by using nanoparticles, intranasal drug delivery, intraventricular administration, or disruption of the blood-brain barrier with either osmotic agents or ultrasound waves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rabies/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].
