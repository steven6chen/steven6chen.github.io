It is commonly associated with impairments in social and occupational functioning. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-schizophrenia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It is among the most disabling and economically catastrophic medical disorders, ranked by the World Health Organization as one of the top ten illnesses contributing to the global burden of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-schizophrenia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Antipsychotic medications are first-line treatment for schizophrenia. They have been shown in clinical trials to be effective in reducing symptoms and behaviors associated with the disorder. However, most patients with schizophrenia experience disabling impairment even after benefiting from antipsychotics, including positive and negative symptoms, cognitive deficits, poor social functioning, and episodes of acute symptomatic relapse. Empirically validated psychosocial interventions, added to antipsychotic medication, target one or more of these deficit areas. </p><p>This topic addresses psychosocial interventions for schizophrenia. Psychosocial interventions for severe mental illness (not limited to schizophrenia), including assertive community treatment and supported employment, are discussed separately. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, clinical manifestations, course, diagnosis and pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia are also discussed separately. Common comorbid presentations of schizophrenia are also discussed separately.

This finding began with the study of &ldquo;expressed emotion&rdquo; (EE), an empirically developed concept characterizing families who are rated highly on hostile, critical or over-involved comments. Patients with schizophrenia who had extensive face-to-face contact with &ldquo;high EE&rdquo; family members have been found to have a higher risk of relapse, compared to patients with low-EE families, following hospitalization with effective pharmacotherapy. The relationship between high EE and relapse is not specific to schizophrenia, but has been observed in other chronic psychiatric and non-psychiatric illnesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-schizophrenia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13622225\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with schizophrenia who have had a recent psychotic relapse and have significant ongoing contact with family members, including relatives and significant others, we recommend the patient and family members receive a family intervention for six to nine months as augmentation to treatment with antipsychotic medication. </p><p>For patients with schizophrenia who have experienced multiple psychotic relapses and reside in a particularly stressful family environment, a more intensive problem-solving family therapy may be helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-schizophrenia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], although the only controlled trial of the intervention was negative.

Components of this approach include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identify critical, hostile, and over-involved parent-patient interactions, explaining that these interactions are associated with worse outcomes, but taking care to avoid misunderstandings that they are a cause of the disorder. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Help families and patients to avoid adverse interactions. An example is re-framing a family member&rsquo;s critical assessment of a patient who will not clean up after him or herself, from &ldquo;passivity&rdquo; or &ldquo;laziness&rdquo; to &ldquo;avolition&rdquo; (ie, a lack of motivation for goal directed behavior), a common symptom of schizophrenia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assign &ldquo;homework&rdquo;, for example, to encourage the patient to implement simple tasks, while encouraging parents to refrain from being critical or prematurely involved. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stressful family dynamics can often be best addressed by finding outside rehabilitative activities or supported employment for the patient.

This can support the development of a schedule for training for the patient in more independent living skills. A minority of patients who need constant supervision due to safety issues may require attendance at a specialized daycare program. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H115334380\"><span class=\"h2\">Administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A family psychosocial intervention for schizophrenia is typically provided in monthly sessions, which should be continued for six to nine months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-schizophrenia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. These sessions may be for an individual family or for groups of families. They should be in addition to the patient&rsquo;s individual visits with a psychiatrist and other clinicians.</p><p>Problem-solving therapy is usually more intensive than a typical family intervention, requiring weekly or bi-weekly visits for the initial two to three months, sometimes in the home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-schizophrenia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. After this period, typically, a monthly schedule of more supportive maintenance sessions can be adopted. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13622239\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1343211\"><span class=\"h3\">Family intervention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A meta-analysis of 2981 individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder in 32 randomized trials found that a family intervention of at least five sessions reduced the frequency of relapse compared to a control condition (Relative Risk [RR] = 0.55, CI 0.5 to 0.6; number need to treat = 7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-schizophrenia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Reductions were also seen in hospital admissions and medication non-adherence.

No differences were seen between groups receiving the two family interventions. In our clinical experience, we have found that problem-solving family therapy prevents re-hospitalization in patients with multiple relapses of schizophrenia who reside in a particularly stressful family environment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13622373\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIAL SKILLS TRAINING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Deficits in areas such as social interactions and independent living skills often interfere with the ability of people with schizophrenia to perform everyday activities and to function in the community. As examples, individuals may have difficulties with personal care, cooking, laundry, paying bills, use of public transportation, leisure activities, developing social networks, and dating. </p><p>Deficits in these skills are related to the negative symptoms (or &ldquo;deficit symptoms&rdquo;) of schizophrenia. Negative symptoms rarely respond to pharmacotherapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-schizophrenia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], but have been found to respond to social skills training as augmentation of antipsychotic medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-schizophrenia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>Social skills training for individuals with schizophrenia consists of behavioral training focused on specific situations, problems, and activities. The ultimate goal of this training is the generalization of learned skills to community-based activities with improved functioning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13622302\"><span class=\"h2\">Theoretical foundation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two programs stemming from distinct conceptual models have been developed to address social skills deficits of people with schizophrenia, including: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Basic social skills training utilizes principles from learning theory to improve social functioning by working with patients to remediate problems in activities of daily living, leisure, relationships, or employment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-schizophrenia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The social problem-solving model focuses on improving impairments in information processing that are assumed to be the cause of deficits in social skills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-schizophrenia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13622309\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend that individuals with schizophrenia who have deficits in skills needed for everyday activities receive social skills training. If there is a choice among social skills training models available, a reasonable approach is to start with the basic model, and if the patient does not experience an adequate response, advance to the more complex problem-solving intervention. Selection may be constrained by the local availability of only one model.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13622316\"><span class=\"h2\">Intervention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two forms of social skills training: the basic model and the social problem-solving model. Although the field has evolved to more integrated, manualized, step-by-step guides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-schizophrenia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], we briefly describe both models to illustrate the evolution of this therapeutic approach.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3203416\"><span class=\"h3\">Basic model</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the basic model, complex social repertoires (such as conversation with a peer) are broken down into simpler steps, which can be taught more effectively, practiced in role playing exercises, and applied in natural settings. </p><p>While the content of skills training programs may vary with the program or with the needs of individual patients, most include an emphasis on interpersonal skills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-schizophrenia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Basic training techniques include behaviorally based instruction, role modeling, rehearsal, corrective feedback, and positive reinforcement. Typical steps include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial training may start with conversation between therapist and patient with immediate feedback to the patient on specific, problematic interpersonal behaviors. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The conversation may be videotaped; the therapist would then review the tape with the patient, pointing out problematic behaviors and suggesting desired alternatives. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After several sessions with the same therapist, the patient may be encouraged to interact with other staff and patients. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eventually these skills may be practiced in the patient&rsquo;s own environment to implement the learned skills more generally. Programs that start as clinic-based can be adapted to targeted areas such as the patient&rsquo;s work place and social settings. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As examples:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A person with affective flattening, poverty of speech, and poor social interaction is encouraged to role play with the therapist. They start a conversation and the therapist provides feedback to foster increased eye-contact, and appropriate hand gesticulation, nodding, and asking follow-up questions. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A paranoid person, with intense responses to others and intimidating eye contact, is encouraged to look down at times, pause before responding, and lower <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> voice. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3203426\"><span class=\"h3\">Social problem solving model</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The social problem-solving model targets behavioral or symptom domains needing changes. The module is based on a conceptualization of social problems in patients with schizophrenia as based, in part, on deficits in receiving, processing and sending skills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-schizophrenia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Receiving skills refer to those necessary to appropriately identify social cues. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Processing skills deal with the context-appropriate interpretation of information and the generation of the various potential responses. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sending skills correspond to the behaviors targeted by the basic skills model. </p><p/><p>The patient is evaluated for problem behaviors and if present the patient is assigned to a relevant module addressing an area for improvement, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medication and symptom management</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recreational activities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Basic conversation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Self-care </p><p/><p>In each module, an emphasis is placed on learning receiving, processing and sending skills. Each module is taught, typically in a classroom setting. (See <a href=\"#H3203510\" class=\"local\">'Administration'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3203510\"><span class=\"h2\">Administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Social skills training is generally conducted several times a week (either in training sessions or as patient practice) for three to six months. After the completion of the program, &ldquo;booster&rdquo; sessions are used in order to maintain gains and facilitate further generalization. Social skills training can be administered as monotherapy or in combination with cognitive psychotherapeutic approaches in the context of cognitive remediation or CBT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-schizophrenia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Clinicians typically need specific training to effectively deliver social-skills training to patients. However, the availability of training manuals, instructional videos, and patient workbooks can aid the implementation of these programs in various community settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-schizophrenia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13622323\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Meta-analyses of clinical trials have found social skills training to be an effective intervention for patients with schizophrenia:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2008 meta-analysis of 22 randomized trials compared social skills training (irrespective of the model) to other interventions or treatment as usual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-schizophrenia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Analyses of trials that included the measures found that social skills training led to improvement in interpersonal and everyday life skills (a moderate effect size of 0.52; 95 percent CI: 0.34 to 0.71), community functioning, and negative symptoms. Evidence is weak or mixed in support of social skills training for other symptoms of schizophrenia, including relapse. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A, 2014 meta-analysis of 48 controlled trials of psychosocial interventions for schizophrenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-schizophrenia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]; SST was found to result in modest reductions in negative symptoms (g=0.27) compared to other interventions or treatment as usual.</p><p/><p>A systematic review found evidence of skills retention for up to one year following training; more studies for longer periods are needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-schizophrenia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Generalization of social skills to the patient&rsquo;s environment is most effective when the training is practiced in that environment. Programs that include the practice of trained skills in the community are more effective than those that are exclusively clinic based, relying on homework assignments for generalization. </p><p>There are no trials comparing the effectiveness of different models of social skills training. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1343443\"><span class=\"h1\">COGNITIVE REMEDIATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cognitive remediation attempts to improve the learning process by targeting more fundamental cognitive impairments, such as attention or planning. The assumption is that if the underlying cognitive impairment can be improved initially, this learning will support more complex cognitive processes, and the patient can then benefit from social skills training, generalizing from its lessons to improve interactions in the community. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1343457\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend that individuals with schizophrenia who experience persistent subjective cognitive deficits (difficulty concentrating or remembering) coupled with scholastic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vocational difficulties receive cognitive remediation as an adjunct to antipsychotic medication.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19490983\"><span class=\"h2\">Administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This approach begins with having the patient repeatedly practice a simple information processing task on a computer, such as speed of response to various stimuli to improve vigilance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-schizophrenia/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Once the person reaches a specified performance threshold, he or she will move on to a more complex computer-based task, such as a test of working memory. Eventually, other higher-order tasks as such planning and social recognition are addressed. Posit Science is a self-contained computer software program for providing cognitive remediation in an outpatient treatment setting or to be used by a patient at home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-schizophrenia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Once these cognitive skills have improved to an adequate level, the person participates in one of the more traditional social-skills training approaches, such as the basic model or the social problem-solving model. (See <a href=\"#H13622373\" class=\"local\">'Social skills training'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19491036\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 2011 meta-analysis of 2,104 participants from 40 clinical trials (each of which studied samples comprised of at least 70 percent patients with schizophrenia, and otherwise patients with other serious mental illnesses) found cognitive remediation for persons with schizophrenia led to an overall moderate, positive effect with an effect size of 0.45 (95% confidence interval [CI]=0.31&mdash;0.59). Analyses of trials including these measures found moderate improvements in global cognition (effect size of 0.45; CI 0.31-0.59) and functioning (effect size of 0.37; CI 0.11-0.635) compared to other interventions or to a passive control condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-schizophrenia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Interventions that integrated cognitive remediation with treatment based on the social problem-solving model have shown evidence of efficacy with some evidence for generalization to community settings. A 2014 meta-analysis comparing cognitive remediation to other structured psychosocial interventions found no advantages for positive or negative symptoms.

(See <a href=\"#H13622373\" class=\"local\">'Social skills training'</a> above.)</p><p>CBT is used to treat medication-resistant psychosis in patients with schizophrenia. Its principal aims are to reduce the intensity of delusions and hallucinations (and related distress) and to promote active participation of the individuals in reducing their risk of relapse and their social disability. Other target symptoms of CBT include the patient&rsquo;s preoccupation with the delusions and hallucinations, and the impact of symptoms on his or her behavior.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H633970894\"><span class=\"h2\">Theoretical foundation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CBT for schizophrenia presumes that a patient with the disorder can, with the help of a therapist, engage in a logical examination of maladaptive aspects of their symptoms. Despite active psychosis, most patients with schizophrenia have the verbal and cognitive capacities to participate in CBT. CBT begins with the patient&rsquo;s interpretation of symptoms, from which the patient and therapist work collaboratively to develop more rational and adaptive behaviors. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H633970901\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with schizophrenia often have some degree of persistent psychosis even when pharmacotherapy has been optimized. We recommend that patients who experience persistent delusions or hallucinations despite adequate trials of antipsychotic medication receive adjunctive CBT. Adequate trials of antipsychotics include use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a> for treatment resistant psychosis, though some patients refuse clozapine due to the risk of agranulocytosis or the inconvenience of repeated blood tests for monitoring. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guidelines-for-prescribing-clozapine-in-schizophrenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guidelines for prescribing clozapine in schizophrenia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=second-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Second-generation antipsychotic medications: Pharmacology, administration, and side effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H633970908\"><span class=\"h2\">Cognitive approaches</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cognitive approaches to patients with schizophrenia focus on exploring the subjective nature of their symptoms, gently challenging their underlying assumptions, and generating alternative interpretations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-schizophrenia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p>The experience and meaning of the beliefs and percepts is initially explored, with the aim of constructing a model of events that makes sense to the individual based on his or her own personal history and perspective. This initial framework allows the therapist to know the language and context the individual uses to describe his symptoms. </p><p>Focused work can then begin on specific delusions and hallucinations by identifying them and collaboratively reviewing with the patient the presence or absence of evidence supporting their validity. This reality testing is followed by generating alternative responses to the delusions or hallucinations. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A patient who reports hearing a derogatory voice telling her that she is worthless can be encouraged to look to see if someone is speaking, or to ask a companion if they hear anything. The patient and clinician then review the findings. Based on the absence of supportive evidence, they can then develop alternative interpretations of the voice, such as that the patient may have misinterpreted an inner experience or misattributed the sensation to an outside source. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A patient with a delusional belief that he has a device implanted in his body, which is sending signals externally, can be encouraged to evaluate evidence for and against the possibility of its existence. As examples, the clinician might ask:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>When was the device implanted? </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Where were you at that time? Were you taken to a hospital with surgical facilities? </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Was your family living with you? How could they have missed you being gone for that long? </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Where was the device implanted? Can you show me a scar on the overlying skin? </p><p/><p>In the absence of supporting evidence, the clinician and patient would generate alternative explanations for the symptoms, such as the patient&rsquo;s misinterpretation of a somatic sensation in the area of the implant or a strong emotion. </p><p>Patients who strongly resist reevaluating delusional beliefs can nevertheless be encouraged to identify ways to reduce related distress while continuing to hold the belief. In the prior example, this may involve learning to live with an implanted device or learning to control its signaling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H633970915\"><span class=\"h2\">Administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CBT can be provided in either an individual or group format. The frequency and duration of therapy can vary but typically consists of weekly or biweekly sessions for four to nine months. Patients who are able to reframe the delusions and hallucinations and develop some psychological distance from these experiences can then be seen less frequently using a more supportive psychotherapeutic approach.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H633970922\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Meta-analyses of clinical trials of CBT for patients with schizophrenia have found the intervention to be efficacious when compared to treatment as usual or to befriending. CBT did not demonstrate superiority in reducing positive or negative symptoms when compared to other evidence-based psychosocial interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-schizophrenia/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>] As an example, a 2014 meta-analysis of 34 randomized trials found that CBT reduced overall, positive, and negative symptoms of psychosis in patients with schizophrenia or other non-affective psychotic disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-schizophrenia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The meta-analysis found the effect size for CBT on overall symptoms of schizophrenia to be in the small range (-0.33, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.19), larger for positive symptoms than negative symptoms, and smaller when sources of bias were controlled. &#160;A 2014 meta-analysis comparing CBT to other structured psychosocial interventions found that CBT was modestly more effective than other interventions in reducing positive symptoms (g=0.23) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-schizophrenia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>A randomized trial, for example, of 144 patients with schizophrenia who exhibited prodromal or early signs of relapse found CBT plus treatment as usual to lead to lower rates of hospitalization (15.3 versus 26.4 percent) and relapse (18.1 versus 34.7 percent) than treatment as usual alone after 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-schizophrenia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The CBT group showed greater improvement than the control group in positive symptoms, negative symptoms, global psychopathology, performance of independent functions and prosocial activities. </p><p>A randomized trial found that reductions in delusional thinking from a group CBT intervention were sustained after three years, when 61 percent of patients were reassessed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-schizophrenia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The trial of 150 patients receiving antipsychotic medication for schizophrenia had previously shown that addition of metacognitive training (MCT) led to reduced delusional thinking six months later, compared to the addition of neuropsychological training, an active control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-schizophrenia/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The three-year reassessment found that the MCT group experienced a sustained reduction in delusions as well as late-emerging improvements in self-esteem and quality of life.</p><p>CBT has largely been shown to be effective for stable (non-acute), long-standing schizophrenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-schizophrenia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Benefit has not been established for patients with recent onset schizophrenia or those experiencing an acute exacerbation of psychotic symptoms. The advantages of CBT may be most apparent for patients who have persistent positive symptoms after receiving adequate trials of different antipsychotic medications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H113098604\"><span class=\"h1\">MULTIMODAL INTERVENTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In clinical trials in patients with first-episode psychosis, multimodal psychosocial interventions in combination with lower-dose, evidence-based pharmacotherapy have improved clinical outcomes compared to usual care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-schizophrenia/abstract/28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-31</a>]. Such team-based programs can be easier to implement in settings with a national healthcare system, due to their integrated staffing, financing, and delivery of care. A clinical trial found that implementation of a model multimodal program was feasible and effective in 34 non-academic community clinics in the United States, funded largely by existing reimbursement mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-schizophrenia/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Four hundred and four patients with a first-psychotic episode (approximately 50 percent ultimately diagnosed with schizophrenia) were randomly assigned to receive usual care or treatment with evidence-based pharmacotherapy, family education about illness management, resilience-focused individual therapy, and supported employment and education. After two years of treatment, patients in the multimodal group had greater improvements in&nbsp;quality of life, participation in work and school, and psychotic symptoms compared with patients receiving usual care. Subjects had a median of 74 weeks of untreated psychosis prior to the study; improvement was greater among those with a shorter duration of untreated psychosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13622358\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family-based interventions, cognitive behavioral therapy, and social-skills training are used to augment antipsychotic medication in the treatment of schizophrenia. Other psychosocial interventions used for schizophrenia and other severe mental illnesses include assertive community treatment and supported employment, which are described separately. (See <a href=\"#H19410373\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psychosocial-interventions-for-severe-mental-illness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psychosocial interventions for severe mental illness&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For individuals with schizophrenia who have had a recent psychotic relapse, have significant ongoing contact with family members and have not previously received the intervention, we recommend that the patient and family members receive a family psychoeducational intervention (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). The intervention is typically provided in monthly sessions with an individual family or a group of families for six to nine months as augmentation to antipsychotic medication and other treatment.

(See <a href=\"#H115334322\" class=\"local\">'Problem-solving family therapy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For individuals who experience persistent delusions or hallucinations despite adequate trials of antipsychotic medication, we recommend adjunctive treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy over medication alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).
