Four species of <em>Echinococcus </em>cause infection in humans. <em>E. granulosus </em>and <em>E. multilocularis </em>are the most common, causing cystic echinococcosis (CE) and alveolar echinococcosis (AE), respectively. The two other species, <em>E. vogeli </em>and <em>E. oligarthus</em>, cause polycystic echinococcosis but have rarely been associated with human infection. Two new species have been identified: <em>E. shiquicus</em> in small mammals from the Tibetan plateau and <em>E. felidis</em> in African lions; their transmission potential to humans is not known [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-echinococcosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The treatment of cystic and alveolar echinococcal infection will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, epidemiology, and control of echinococcal infection are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-echinococcosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of echinococcosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-control-of-echinococcosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and control of echinococcosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CYSTIC ECHINOCOCCOSIS (E. GRANULOSUS)</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5041303\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management options for cystic echinococcosis (CE) include surgery, percutaneous management, drug therapy, and observation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-echinococcosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Surgery has been the traditional approach for treatment of CE; subsequently, alternative approaches have been introduced and have replaced surgery as the treatment of choice in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-echinococcosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>In general, clinical approach depends on the World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic classification (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F71806\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71806 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F87459\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef87459 \">image 1</a>). Stage CE1 and CE3a cysts have a single compartment; such cysts that are &lt;5 cm may be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albendazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albendazole</a> alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-echinococcosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In settings where albendazole treatment with follow-up monitoring is not feasible, definitive management with percutaneous treatment via puncture, aspiration, injection, and reaspiration (PAIR) is an acceptable alternative approach. Stage CE1 and CE3a cysts that are &gt;5 cm may be treated with albendazole in combination with PAIR. In situations where albendazole treatment is not feasible, percutaneous treatment with PAIR (in the absence of adjunctive drug therapy) is an acceptable alternative approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-echinococcosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Issues related to drug therapy are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Drug therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Stage CE2 and CE3b cysts have many compartments that require individual puncture; patients with such cysts commonly relapse after PAIR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-echinococcosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Therefore, management of these cysts requires either modified catheterization technique (eg, non-PAIR percutaneous therapy) or surgery (with adjunctive drug therapy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-echinococcosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The optimal choice between these approaches is uncertain and further study is needed.</p><p>Stages CE4 and CE5 are inactive cysts that may be managed with observation.</p><p>There are few randomized trials comparing different treatments, and the level of evidence supporting the use of one therapeutic modality over another is low. In one study of 32 patients with hepatic cysts comparing percutaneous drainage alone, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albendazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albendazole</a> alone, and percutaneous drainage in combination with albendazole, those who received combination therapy had the greatest size reduction observed ultrasonographically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-echinococcosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Subsequently, a randomized trial performed among 50 patients demonstrated that outcomes among those who underwent percutaneous drainage (in combination with albendazole) were comparable to outcomes among patients who underwent surgery (with no albendazole therapy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-echinococcosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5041311\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment modalities</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgery</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3785912\"><span class=\"h4\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery is the treatment of choice for management of complicated cysts (eg, rupture cyst, cysts with biliary fistulae, cysts compressing vital structures, cysts with secondary infection or hemorrhage) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-echinococcosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Surgery is also warranted for management of cysts with many daughter vesicles that are not suitable for percutaneous treatment (eg, WHO stage CE2 and CE3b) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F71806\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71806 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F87459\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef87459 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-echinococcosis/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>]. Other indications for surgery include cyst diameter &gt;10 cm, superficial cyst at risk of rupture due to trauma, and extrahepatic disease (lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-echinococcosis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>], bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-echinococcosis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>], brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-echinococcosis/abstract/10,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12,13</a>], kidney, or other site) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-echinococcosis/abstract/3,14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,14-17</a>]. Surgery is also appropriate in settings where percutaneous treatment is not available.</p><p>Adjunctive drug therapy should be administered to minimize risk of secondary echinococcosis from seeding of protoscolices in the abdominal cavity in the event of fluid spillage. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albendazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Albendazole</a> is generally administered beginning one week prior to surgery and continued for at least four weeks postoperatively. Some use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=praziquantel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">praziquantel</a> in addition to albendazole, although there is no clear evidence regarding its efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-echinococcosis/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3784862\" class=\"local\">'Adjunctive treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>Surgery may cure the patient, but morbidity, mortality, and relapse rates can vary widely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-echinococcosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Complications include secondary infection of cyst cavity, intraabdominal abscess, biliary fistula, sclerosing cholangitis, and spillage of cyst contents leading to secondary echinococcosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anaphylaxis. Postoperative complications occur in less than 1 percent of cases; recurrent echinococcosis occurs in 2 to 25 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-echinococcosis/abstract/17,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,20</a>]. These rates depend on the location and size of the cyst and the surgeon's experience.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h4\">Techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of surgical therapy consist of evacuating the cyst and obliterating the residual cavity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-echinococcosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Every effort should be made to avoid fluid spillage, which can lead to secondary seeding of infection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anaphylaxis. The safest and most effective surgical procedure is uncertain; the relative advantages of the different approaches have not been clearly established. Traditional approaches have included radical resection including pericystectomy or more conservative techniques. Laparoscopic surgery may be an alternative to open surgery in some cases.</p><p>The surgical approach must be individualized depending on the cyst features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-echinococcosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Removal of the intact cyst is preferred, if feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-echinococcosis/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>]. Alternatively, the cyst can be opened and sterilized with protoscolicidal agents, followed by evacuation of cyst contents and removal of the pericystic tissue. In one study including 132 patients with liver cysts treated with a variety of surgical procedures, cyst excision and omentoplasty were associated with the most favorable clinical results and lowest complication rates; a recurrence rate of 4.5 percent was observed with 4.5 years median follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-echinococcosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Every effort should be made to avoid fluid spillage, which can lead to secondary seeding of infection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anaphylaxis. For circumstances in which intact removal of the cyst is not feasible, a protoscolicidal agent such as hypertonic saline should be injected into the cyst prior to removing the contents. In addition, the surgical field should be protected with pads soaked in protoscolicidal agents. However, protoscolicidal agents should not be used in the setting of biliary communication, to minimize the risk of sclerosing cholangitis or pancreatitis. The anatomy of biliary communication should be defined intraoperatively (radioopaque dye may be useful if available); any biliary leaks should be repaired surgically prior to application of the protoscolicidal agent.</p><p>The most commonly used protoscolicidal agent is hypertonic saline (20 percent); the solution should be in contact with the germinal layer for at least 15 minutes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F87460\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87460 \">figure 1</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albendazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Albendazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivermectin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ivermectin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=praziquantel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">praziquantel</a> solutions have been used as protoscolicidal agents, although their efficacy and safety require further study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-echinococcosis/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Formalin has been associated with sclerosing cholangitis and should not be used.</p><p>If spillage does occur, the peritoneum should be washed with hypertonic saline. The patient should be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albendazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albendazole</a> (three to six months) and a brief course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=praziquantel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">praziquantel</a> (seven days) should also be administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-echinococcosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The management of anaphylaxis is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-emergency-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Emergency treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Laparoscopic surgery has been described for treatment of <em>Echinococcus</em>, although no randomized trials comparing laparoscopy with open procedures have been performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-echinococcosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Laparoscopy may be associated with increased risk of spillage due to elevated intraabdominal pressures caused by pneumoperitoneum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-echinococcosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Laparoscopy is most likely to be successful in the setting of anteriorly located hepatic cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-echinococcosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Exclusion criteria for laparoscopy include deep intraparenchymal cysts, posterior cysts situated close to the vena cava, and presence of more than three cysts with calcified walls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-echinococcosis/abstract/3,31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,31-34</a>].</p><p>Surgical approaches for management of lung cysts include lobectomy, wedge resection, pericystectomy, intact endocystectomy, and capitonnage. In a study of 842 patients followed for 3 to 20 years, a recurrence rate of 1.9 percent was noted after intact endocystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-echinococcosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2662872837\"><span class=\"h3\">Percutaneous management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two categories of percutaneous techniques. The first approach aims to destroy the germinal layer with scolicidal agents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F87460\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87460 \">figure 1</a>). This is done via the PAIR technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-echinococcosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. PAIR is usually effective for definitive treatment of cysts that do not have daughter cysts (eg, WHO stage CE1 and CE3a).</p><p>The second approach consists of evacuating the entire cyst with a large-bore catheter. This is generally done for management of cysts that are difficult to drain or tend to relapse after PAIR, such as WHO stage CE2 and CE3b cysts (which may contain daughter cysts). Establishing whether daughter cysts are present is important for guiding treatment, since the presence of daughter cysts reduces the likelihood of successful definitive treatment with PAIR.</p><p>Percutaneous treatment is associated with risk for anaphylaxis; in one review of treatment for nearly 6000 cysts, anaphylaxis occurred in 1.6 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-echinococcosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albendazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Albendazole</a> should be administered for at least one month following percutaneous treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-echinococcosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3784862\" class=\"local\">'Adjunctive treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h4\">PAIR procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PAIR is less invasive than surgery and can be both a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-echinococcosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The cure rate with PAIR for appropriately selected cysts is &gt;95 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-echinococcosis/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>]. Among 231 liver cysts in 163 Italian patients treated with PAIR (ethanol was the scolicidal agent), one relapse was observed after four years of follow-up; this was successfully treated with repeat PAIR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-echinococcosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Establishing whether daughter cysts are present is important for guiding treatment, since the presence of daughter cysts generally precludes use of PAIR for definitive management.</p><p>PAIR may be used for primary treatment of WHO stage CE1 and CE3a cysts (eg cysts that do not have daughter cysts), for treatment following relapse of CE1 or CE3a cysts managed previously with medical therapy alone, or for treatment following relapse after surgery (in the absence of daughter cysts). PAIR has been used successfully for management of cysts in the liver and other abdominal sites (eg, abdominal cavity, spleen, kidney), although many experts would approach these lesions surgically. Cysts in extraabdominal sites such as lung or bone are less amenable to management with PAIR.</p><p>PAIR is performed under ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) guidance. Following cyst puncture, aspirated fluid should be evaluated histopathologically for presence of protoscolices. Following injection of the protoscolicidal agent, reaspiration should be performed after at least 10 to 15 minutes. The presence of protoscolices in the reaspirated fluid should prompt repeat protoscolicidal injection. Follow-up after PAIR is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> below.)</p><p>Adjunctive drug therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albendazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albendazole</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mebendazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mebendazole</a> should be administered at least four hours prior to PAIR. Albendazole should be continued for one month after the procedure; mebendazole should be continued for three months after the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-echinococcosis/abstract/1,14,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14,20</a>]. Issues related to drug therapy are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Drug therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Further study is needed regarding the optimal approach, including use of needle versus catheter, quantity of protoscolicidal agent, and duration of follow-up required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-echinococcosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>PAIR should not be performed in the following circumstances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-echinococcosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cyst with nondrainable solid material or echogenic foci</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Superficial cyst at risk of rupture into the abdominal cavity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cyst that has ruptured into the peritoneum</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cyst with biliary communication</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inactive or calcified cyst</p><p/><p>Risks of PAIR include spillage of cyst contents into the peritoneum (which can lead to secondary echinococcosis, urticaria, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anaphylaxis), chemical sclerosing cholangitis, biliary fistula (6 percent), local recurrence (3 percent), and bleeding and infection (4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-echinococcosis/abstract/41,43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,43-45</a>].
