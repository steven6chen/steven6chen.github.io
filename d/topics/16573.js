Acute bacterial suppurative parotitis is caused most commonly by <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and mixed oral aerobes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anaerobes. It often occurs in the setting of debilitation, dehydration, and poor oral hygiene, particularly among elderly postoperative patients.</p><p>The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, microbiology, diagnosis, and treatment of suppurative parotitis will be reviewed here. Deep neck space infections and salivary duct stones are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-neck-space-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Deep neck space infections&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salivary-gland-stones\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Salivary gland stones&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H973167097\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The parotid glands are located on the sides of the face anterior to the external auditory canal, superior to the angle of the mandible, and inferior to the zygomatic arch. Most of the parotid gland is superficial to the masseter muscle. The salivary gland consists of 20 to 30 intraparotid and periparotid lymph nodes with lymphatic drainage from the ipsilateral side of the face and forehead, including the auricular region and the external auditory canal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-parotitis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Stensen's duct arises from the anterior border of the parotid gland and is 4 to 7 cm long, narrows to 1.2 mm at an isthmus, and the os is 0.5 mm and is opposite the upper second molar (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F115303\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115303 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Acute bacterial suppurative parotitis may occur when salivary stasis permits retrograde seeding of the Stensen's duct by a mixed oral flora [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-parotitis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Ductal obstruction by calculi or tumor may predispose to suppuration. Abscess formation may also arise by contiguous infection or hematogenous seeding to the intraparotid or periparotid lymph nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-parotitis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H973167104\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Suppurative parotitis typically occurs in elderly postoperative patients who are dehydrated or intubated, although it may also be seen in outpatients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-parotitis-in-adults/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Other predisposing factors include recent intensive teeth cleaning, use of anticholinergic drugs and other drugs that reduce salivary flow, malnutrition, salivary calculi with obstruction, and neoplasm of the oral cavity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-parotitis-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Infection of embryogenic cysts, such as the first branchial cleft, may result in frequent suppuration of the parotid gland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-parotitis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H973167111\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Suppurative parotitis is characterized by the sudden onset of firm, erythematous swelling of the pre- and postauricular areas that extends to the angle of the mandible. This is associated with exquisite local pain and tenderness with complaints of trismus and dysphagia. Systemic findings of high fevers, chills, and marked toxicity are generally present.</p><p>On examination, a fluctuant quality is generally not appreciated because of the dense parotid fascia that overlies the gland. Purulent material may be expressed from the orifice of the Stensen's duct in over one-half of the cases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F114804\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114804 \">picture 1</a>). Drainage can be accomplished by gentle compression around the opening of the Stensen's duct.<strong> </strong></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H973167143\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The microbiology of acute suppurative parotitis is quite variable and is often polymicrobial. <em>S. aureus</em> is by far the most frequently isolated pathogen, but anaerobes are also common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-parotitis-in-adults/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. Gram-negative organisms (Enterobacteriaceae, <em>Eikenella corrodens</em>, and other gram-negative bacilli) are often seen in hospitalized patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-parotitis-in-adults/abstract/3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7</a>]. For unexplained reasons, <em>Klebsiella</em> spp are particularly prevalent among patients with diabetes mellitus from Southeast Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-parotitis-in-adults/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of Klebsiella pneumoniae infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The polymicrobial nature of parotid space infections was illustrated in a study of 32 patients with acute suppurative parotitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-parotitis-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Aerobic bacteria were isolated in 34 percent, anaerobic bacteria in 41 percent, and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 25 percent. <em>S. aureus</em> was the predominant aerobe (in 10 patients), followed by viridans streptococci and <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> (in four patients each). Pigmented <em>Prevotella</em> and <em>Porphyromonas</em> spp, <em>Fusobacterium</em> spp, and <em>Peptostreptococcus</em> spp were the predominant anaerobes.</p><p>Rare causes of suppurative parotitis include <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em>, <em>Moraxella catarrhalis</em>, Enterobacteriaceae spp, <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>, and <em>Actinomyces</em> spp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-parotitis-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H973167152\"><span class=\"h1\">IMAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imaging studies are useful to assess for inflammation or duct obstruction by a stone, and to differentiate between acute suppurative parotitis and frank abscess collection or a solid tumor. </p><p>Imaging options include ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance sialography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-parotitis-in-adults/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Ultrasound is our preferred initial imaging modality for suspected suppurative or obstructive parotitis, since it is particularly useful for detecting stones in the duct or parenchyma and for differentiating between obstructive and nonobstructive sialadenitis. An abscess collection may be seen as a hypoechogenic lesion surrounded by an irregular echogenic rim within the gland parenchyma. CT is the most sensitive tool for differentiating suppurative cellulitis from frank abscess with rim enhancement, and is a useful supplement if ultrasound findings are not definitive. Magnetic resonance sialography provides the best detail of ductal abnormalities within the parotid gland, and is superior to conventional sialography; it is often used in conjunction with magnetic resonance imaging to assess ductal and parenchymal diseases of the parotid gland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-parotitis-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. X-ray sialography cannot be used during acute infection and requires the injection of contrast material [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-parotitis-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salivary-gland-stones#H3827756637\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Salivary gland stones&quot;, section on 'Indications for imaging'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H973167159\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis is usually made when the characteristic clinical findings are present, as discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H973167111\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p>An elevated serum amylase in the absence of pancreatitis supports the clinical suspicion of parotid involvement. When purulent drainage is present at the opening of Stensen's duct, it should be collected for Gram stain and culture. Gram stain is particularly helpful in detecting staphylococci and Candida. Culture obtained intraorally, however, should be interpreted with caution since the results may represent contamination by the oral flora. </p><p>Ultrasound-guided needle aspiration of the swollen parotid gland by an extraoral route is recommended to obtain specimens for microbiologic evaluation prior to empirical antimicrobial therapy. Specimens should be cultured for both aerobes and anaerobes, as well as fungi and mycobacteria. The primary utility of the culture data is to obtain susceptibility testing of a dominant organism in order to ensure adequate antibacterial coverage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H973167167\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of suppurative parotitis includes hydration and intravenous antibiotics. Since suppurative parotitis may potentially spread to deep fascial spaces of the head and neck and is potentially life-threatening, outpatient management with oral antibiotics is not advised. Surgical incision and drainage should be implemented if there is no clinical response after 48 hours of treatment with empiric intravenous antibiotics. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H42625563\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial antibiotic regimens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial empiric antimicrobial regimens are based upon the expected microbiology and host factors and should be directed at <em>S. aureus</em> (including methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> [MRSA]) and mixed oral aerobes and anaerobes. We add coverage for Enterobacteriaceae and <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> in patients with recent hospitalization or who are immunocompromised. The spectrum of the antimicrobial regimen should be narrowed once microbiologic data become available. </p><p>The antibiotic doses recommended below are intended for patients with normal renal function; dosing of some of these agents must be reduced in patients with renal dysfunction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H181072748\"><span class=\"h3\">Immunocompetent hosts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the<strong> </strong>immunocompetent host, we suggest:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nafcillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Nafcillin</a> (1.5 g IV every four hours) or another antistaphylococcal penicillin or a first-generation cephalosporin <strong>plus either</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Metronidazole</a> (500 mg IV every six to eight hours) <strong>or</strong> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> (600 mg IV every six to eight hours)</p><p/><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Vancomycin</a> (15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV every 12 hours) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=linezolid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">linezolid</a> (600 mg orally or IV every 12 hours) should be substituted for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nafcillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nafcillin</a> in the immunocompetent host with risk factors for methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> (MRSA) infection.

The choice of an oral antimicrobial regimen for step-down therapy should ideally be guided by culture and susceptibility data. A combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> (450 mg orally three times daily) plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> (500 or 750 mg orally twice daily) may be used to cover oral aerobes (including Enterobacteriaceae spp), <em>P. aeruginosa</em>, many strains of <em>S. aureus</em>, and anaerobes; the higher dose of ciprofloxacin should be used when <em>P. aeruginosa</em> is suspected. An alternative regimen that does <strong>not</strong> have anti-Pseudomonas activity is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-and-clavulanate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin-clavulanate</a> (875 mg orally twice daily) with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=linezolid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">linezolid</a> (600 mg orally twice daily); linezolid should be included if MRSA is suspected. Another possible regimen is linezolid plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moxifloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">moxifloxacin</a> (400 mg orally once daily), which provides activity against oral aerobes (including Enterobacteriaceae spp), <em>S. aureus</em>, and anaerobes, but does not have good activity against <em>P. aeruginosa</em>. The choice of regimen based upon the patient&rsquo;s immune status is outlined in the Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F60370\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60370 \">table 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7811740\"><span class=\"h2\">Duration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The duration of therapy depends upon the host immune status, severity and extent of infection, and response to therapy.

Since the parotid space abuts the parapharyngeal space, suppurative parotitis is an important source of parapharyngeal space infection with potential for septic jugular thrombophlebitis (Lemierre's syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-parotitis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Another potential complication is facial nerve palsy, which is relatively rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-parotitis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F79036\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79036 \">figure 2</a>). Rarely, a fistula may occur as a complication of acute suppurative parotitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-parotitis-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. CT sialography and fistulography can be performed to evaluate the extent of the fistula and to exclude the possibility of an underlying malignancy. A fistulectomy may be required for definitive management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of osteomyelitis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-neck-space-infections#H990947868\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Deep neck space infections&quot;, section on 'Parapharyngeal space infections'</a>.)</p><p>Surgical exploration and drainage may be required both for diagnosis and therapy. If an infectious process is not found, a search for noninfectious causes of parotid swelling (eg, malignancy or collagen vascular diseases) should be made. In rare instances, recurrent infection of the parotid gland may occur, particularly in patients with comorbid conditions, such as diabetes mellitus. In such patients, a parotidectomy may be considered. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H973167211\"><span class=\"h1\">NONSUPPURATIVE CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of organisms can cause parotitis. Mumps is the classic virus to cause parotitis, but other viruses that have been associated with parotitis include influenza virus, coxsackievirus, Epstein-Barr virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, parainfluenza viruses, herpes simplex virus, and cytomegalovirus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-parotitis-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In HIV-infected patients, bilateral parotid swelling with cystic lesions has been observed and may be due either to HIV-associated sialadenitis or immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome following initiation of antiretroviral therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-parotitis-in-adults/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has also been associated with parotid abnormalities, such as lymphocytic sialadenitis and Sjogren's syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-parotitis-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Viral parotitis may be distinguished from suppurative parotitis by a prodromal period, followed by acute swelling of the involved gland, which can last 5 to 10 days and is often bilateral. Viral parotitis does not cause a purulent discharge from Stensen's duct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-parotitis-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Serologic evaluation can establish the diagnosis.
