This discussion will include the GH gene, the mechanisms and regulators of GH secretion, and a summary of the actions of GH. The physiology of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which mediates most peripheral actions of GH, is discussed separately.

The pituitary GH gene (GH-N) encodes two alternatively spliced mRNA products, which give rise to the abundant circulating 22 kDa GH molecule and a less abundant (10 percent of circulating GH) 20 kDa GH lacking amino acids 32 to 46. Placental syncytiotrophoblast cells express a GH variant (hGH-V), as well as three other genes for human chorionic somatotropin (hCS). During pregnancy, maternal GH secretion declines and is replaced by rising placental-derived GH. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Endocrine and metabolic changes&quot;, section on 'Anterior pituitary'</a>.)</p><p>Regulation of the pituitary GH-N gene appears to be under complex hormonal, developmental, and tissue-specific control mediated by regulatory elements of the gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-growth-hormone/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The tissue-specific development of somatotrophs and expression of GH appear to be largely determined by the POU1F1 (Pit-1) transcription factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-growth-hormone/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-molecular-genetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of molecular genetics&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Rarely, dominant-negative mutations in the GH gene are associated with inherited isolated GH deficiency syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-growth-hormone/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Mutations in the <em>Prop-1</em> gene (which is necessary for the differentiation of a cell type that is a precursor to somatotroph, lactotroph, thyrotroph, and gonadotroph cells) and in the <em>POU1F1 </em>(Pit-1) gene (which acts temporally just after <em>Prop-1</em> and is necessary for the differentiation of a cell type that is a precursor of somatotroph, lactotroph, and, to a lesser degree, thyrotroph cells) also account for rare cases of GH deficiency that are usually accompanied by other pituitary hormone deficiencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-growth-hormone/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency in children&quot;, section on 'Molecular genetics of growth hormone deficiency'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hypopituitarism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hypopituitarism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GH SECRETION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Growth hormone (GH) secretion is directly controlled by hypothalamic and peripheral factors acting on the somatotrophs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-growth-hormone/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Hypothalamic growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and somatostatin (SRIH) stimulate and inhibit GH secretion, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-growth-hormone/abstract/2,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,11</a>]. These hormones act by binding to specific cell-surface receptors on the somatotroph cells.</p><p>Daily GH secretory rates decline from a peak of approximately 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> during puberty to approximately 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> by age 55 years; this decline parallels the age-related decline in body mass index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-growth-hormone/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Thus, GH production falls by approximately 50 percent every seven years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-growth-hormone/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The serum half-life of GH is approximately 14 minutes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Growth hormone-releasing hormone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GHRH stimulates GH transcription and secretion and also somatotroph proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-growth-hormone/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The GHRH receptor is a cell surface-associated, seven membrane-spanning domain protein linked to a G protein (Gs) that, after ligand-induced activation, stimulates intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-growth-hormone/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peptide-hormone-signal-transduction-and-regulation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peptide hormone signal transduction and regulation&quot;</a>). The gastrointestinal peptide, ghrelin, specifically induces GH secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-growth-hormone/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], and the ghrelin receptor is expressed on the anterior pituitary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-growth-hormone/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ghrelin\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ghrelin&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Ghrelin is synthesized in the stomach and is an important nutritional regulator of GH secretion. Mediated by GH, ghrelin acts to maintain blood sugar levels during starvation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-growth-hormone/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Although somatotrophs express four of these subtypes (to the exclusion of SSTR-4), SSTR2 and SSTR5 preferentially signal to suppress the secretion in the pituitary of GH (and thyrotropin [TSH]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-growth-hormone/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The role of pituitary SSTR1 and SSTR3 receptors is not known. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-somatostatin-and-its-analogues#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of somatostatin and its analogues&quot;, section on 'Receptors'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Other regulators</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which mediates most of the peripheral actions of GH, inhibits GH secretion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-insulin-like-growth-factor-1\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of insulin-like growth factor-1&quot;</a>.)</p><p>GH secretion is also affected by nutritional factors. GH secretion is increased in subjects who are malnourished or fasting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-growth-hormone/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], and it is stimulated by high protein meals and intravenously administered amino acids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-growth-hormone/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In contrast, hyperglycemia and leptin inhibit GH secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-growth-hormone/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-leptin\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of leptin&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Thus, there appears to be a complex interaction of nutritional factors and hypothalamic appetite-regulating peptides in mediating GH secretion. Insulin-induced hypoglycemia is a powerful stimulus to GH release that may be used as a provocative test for the diagnosis of impaired GH reserve. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-testing-for-hypopituitarism#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic testing for hypopituitarism&quot;, section on 'Growth hormone'</a>.)</p><p>A number of other factors influence GH secretion; these effects on GH secretion include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stimulation by estrogen and inhibition by glucocorticoid excess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-growth-hormone/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stimulation by dopamine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apomorphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">apomorphine</a> (a dopamine-receptor agonist), alpha-adrenergic agonists, and beta-adrenergic antagonists.

It is thought that the pulsatile bursts of GH release are mediated by reduction in tonic inhibition by somatostatin, perhaps in association with bursts of GHRH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-growth-hormone/abstract/11,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H201813195\"><span class=\"h3\">24-hour sampling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Twenty-minute GH sampling for 24 hours allows accurate assessment of mean serum GH concentrations. Mean (&plusmn;SE) nighttime serum GH concentrations are 1.0&plusmn;0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> and mean daytime concentrations are 0.6&plusmn;0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> in normal adults. Using ultrasensitive GH assays, normal GH concentrations may even be lower. Peak serum GH concentrations are 4.3&plusmn;0.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> at night and 2.7&plusmn;0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> during the day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-growth-hormone/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. GH secretion is lower in older and obese subjects and is higher during puberty and when corrected for body surface area in neonates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-growth-hormone/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p>Peak GH secretory activity occurs within an hour after the onset of deep sleep. Exercise, physical activity, trauma, and sepsis are associated with increased GH secretion. With exercise, as an example, serum GH concentrations may increase to 20 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-growth-hormone/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Integrated 24-hour GH secretion is higher in women than in men and increases in postmenopausal women during estrogen replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-growth-hormone/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>The development of ultrasensitive GH assays has facilitated detailed studies of GH secretory dynamics. Studies in which serum GH was measured using an ultrasensitive, chemiluminescence-based assay with a sensitivity of 0.002 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> have revealed the following results:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are approximately 10 pulses of GH secretion per day, lasting approximately 90 minutes and separated by approximately 128 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-growth-hormone/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Thus, approximately 50 percent of frequently collected samples collected during the day in normal subjects have undetectable serum GH concentrations, and GH is undetectable in over 95 percent of samples in obese or older subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-growth-hormone/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. As a result, random measurement of serum GH will likely not distinguish patients with GH deficiency or GH excess from normal subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-growth-hormone/abstract/22,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,27,28</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-testing-for-hypopituitarism#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic testing for hypopituitarism&quot;, section on 'Growth hormone'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sex-specific differences in GH pulse amplitude and mass are distinguishable. As an example, glucose loading suppresses serum GH concentrations to &lt;0.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> in women and &lt;0.07 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> in men; however, this probably reflects the lower basal concentrations in men rather than a greater suppressive effect of glucose loading [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-growth-hormone/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p>In summary, GH pulsatility and net hormone secretion reflect the tonic interaction of multiple complex inputs but is ultimately determined by the balanced control of GHRH and somatostatin and perhaps ghrelin action. The pattern of GH secretion also impacts upon GH action in that several tissue responses to GH appear to be determined by the secretory patterns of GH rather than the absolute amount of GH that is secreted. The greater GH pulsatility in men, as compared with the relatively continuous GH secretion in women, may be a determinant of linear growth patterns, liver enzyme induction, and GH-signaling molecule (STAT 5b) activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-growth-hormone/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">ACTIONS OF GH</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">GH receptor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Growth hormone (GH) acts by binding to a specific receptor homodimer, located mostly in the liver, and inducing intracellular signaling by a phosphorylation cascade involving the <span class=\"nowrap\">JAK/STAT</span> (signal transducing activators of transcription) pathway. Its predominant action is to stimulate hepatic synthesis and secretion of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), a potent growth and differentiation factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-growth-hormone/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The GH receptor is a 70 kd protein that is a member of the class of receptors common to the <span class=\"nowrap\">cytokine/hematopoietin</span> superfamily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-growth-hormone/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The receptor consists of an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a single membrane-spanning domain, and a cytoplasmic signaling component.

Laron dwarfism is associated with normal or high serum GH concentrations, low serum GH-binding protein concentrations, and low serum IGF-1 concentrations. Over 30 different homozygous or heterozygous exonic and intronic mutations of the receptor have been described, most of which are found in its extracellular ligand-binding domain.
