Each year approximately one million people in the United States seek medical care for burns, approximately one-third of these in the emergency department [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-adults/abstract/1,4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4-6</a>]. Although the vast majority of injuries do not require hospitalization, severe burns can lead to significant morbidity and death.</p><p>The initial assessment and management of the patient with moderate and severe thermal burns will be reviewed here. Details of burn classification, burn management in children, treatment of minor burns, and other issues related to burn management are discussed separately.

Therefore it is important that clinicians properly characterize the size and severity of their patients' burns. Reassessment of thermal burn size and depth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F73309\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73309 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57124\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57124 \">table 2</a>) is important, particularly early in the management of patients with severe injuries, as the extent of injury often increases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-burn-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of burn injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL ASSESSMENT AND TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessment and initial treatment of severe burns is performed simultaneously with trauma resuscitation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51484\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef51484 \">algorithm 1</a>). Initial management focuses on stabilizing the airway, breathing, and circulation (ABC's). The primary evaluation includes assessing for evidence of respiratory distress and smoke inhalation injury, evaluating cardiovascular status, looking for other injuries, and determining the depth and extent of burns. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Classification of burns'</a> above.)</p><p>Hot and burned clothing and debris is removed (caretakers should take precautions to avoid injuring themselves when removing such material). Early transfer to a burn center should be arranged when injuries meet the criteria for major burns (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F74855\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74855 \">table 1</a>). Burn patients may sustain single or multisystem trauma and should be evaluated accordingly.

The AMPLE trauma history should be obtained, if possible (Allergies, Medications, Past medical history, Last meal, Events).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway management</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Assessment and approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite advances in ventilatory management, inhalation injury remains a leading cause of death in adult burn victims [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-adults/abstract/1,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,5</a>]. The risk of inhalation injury increases with the extent of the burn and is present in two-thirds of patients with burns greater than 70 percent of the total body surface area (TBSA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. While assessing the airway, clinicians should immobilize the patient's cervical spine as appropriate. </p><p>It is critical to maintain the airway and provide supplemental oxygen in patients with major burns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Upper airway edema following a burn-related injury can occur rapidly. Among patients who manifest signs of smoke inhalation, a sizable percentage develop complete airway obstruction and there is no clinical means to determine which patients will do so [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Fluid resuscitation can exacerbate laryngeal swelling, increasing the difficulty of tracheal intubation. Therefore, intubation should not be delayed if severe inhalation injury or respiratory distress is present or anticipated. Intubation prior to transport is prudent for many patients who require transfer to a burn center. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Succinylcholine</a> may be used as part of a rapid sequence intubation during the first 72 hours following a severe burn, but not thereafter because of the risk of severe hyperkalemia. A significant percentage of intubated burn patients will develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

These include an arterial blood gas (ABG) and a chest radiograph. Serial peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR), if obtainable, in addition to repeat ABGs, can provide evidence of declining pulmonary function, and are particularly useful early in a patient&rsquo;s course. These studies can be repeated whenever findings from repeat examinations, pulse oximetry, or capnography suggest a decline in clinical status. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simple-and-mixed-acid-base-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Simple and mixed acid-base disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Monitoring of end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> (EtCO<sub>2</sub>) using capnometry or capnography can provide useful information about respiratory status, adequacy of resuscitation, and potential cyanide toxicity, and should be initiated if feasible. A serum lactate concentration should also be obtained if cyanide poisoning is a concern. If available, fiberoptic laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy can assess the extent of airway injury and assist with intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is obtained to assess for cardiac dysfunction.

Standard pulse oximetry is <strong>NOT</strong> reliable with significant carbon monoxide toxicity. A standard arterial blood gas reports the concentration of oxygen dissolved in blood and cannot be used to establish or rule out the diagnosis of carbon monoxide or cyanide poisoning. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbon-monoxide-poisoning#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carbon monoxide poisoning&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Hyperbaric oxygen treatment may be needed if carbon monoxide levels are high, or if treatment for cyanide poisoning with methemoglobin is necessary but places the patient at risk for severe hypoxemia. Efforts to transport the patient for hyperbaric treatment must not detract from airway management and fluid resuscitation, the most important components of initial burn resuscitation. Treatment with high flow oxygen alone effectively removes carbon monoxide and the benefits of hyperbaric treatment remain a source of controversy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbon-monoxide-poisoning#H1884832241\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carbon monoxide poisoning&quot;, section on 'Hyperbaric oxygen'</a>.)</p><p>Clinicians should consider the possibility of cyanide toxicity and keep a low threshold for initiating treatment. Complicating the diagnosis is the depressed level of consciousness of many severe burn victims, which may be caused by carbon monoxide, traumatic shock, or head injury, in addition to potential cyanide toxicity. A serum lactate measurement and EtCO<sub>2</sub> monitoring may provide useful information when determining management of these patients and should be performed if cyanide poisoning is a possibility. Cyanide toxicity poisons mitochondria forcing cells to use anaerobic metabolism. This results in a lactic acidosis and a compensatory drop in EtCO<sub>2</sub>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanide-poisoning#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cyanide poisoning&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>We suggest treatment for cyanide toxicity to be initiated in severe burn victims with an unexplained lactic acidosis or a low or declining EtCO<sub>2</sub> level. If these measurements are unavailable, we suggest treatment be initiated in any patient demonstrating a depressed level of consciousness, cardiac arrest, or cardiac decompensation. Particularly with severe burn victims, we strongly prefer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxocobalamin-vitamin-b12a-supplement-and-cyanide-antidote-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxocobalamin</a> to alternative cyanide antidotes.

Patients with severe burns often require tracheal intubation. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Assessment and approach'</a> above.)</p><p>Bronchodilators (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albuterol</a>) can be useful when bronchospasm is present. Corticosteroids, however, have been associated with an increased risk of bacterial infection and should <strong>not</strong> be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Although fluid resuscitation is critically important in managing patients with significant burns, fluid status should be closely monitored in order to avoid overhydration and possible exacerbation of pulmonary edema. Some researchers have questioned the association between fluid resuscitation volumes and pulmonary edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Fluid resuscitation'</a> below.)</p><p>Should mechanical ventilation be necessary, institution of low tidal volume ventilation to minimize airway pressures reduces the incidence of ventilator-associated lung injury and improves outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Clinician tolerance of some degree of respiratory acidosis (so-called permissive hypercapnia) may be required to achieve lower airway pressures. Other ventilatory strategies, such as high frequency percussive ventilation and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation may be useful, but are not well studied in burn patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-adults/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>].

Rapid, aggressive fluid resuscitation to reconstitute intravascular volume and thereby maintain end-organ perfusion is crucial.

Arterial lines are often used to monitor blood pressure; urine output is used to determine the adequacy of fluid resuscitation (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring fluid status'</a> below).</p><p>Over-resuscitation can be problematic and has been associated with multiple morbidities, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, multiorgan failure, and abdominal, extremity, and orbital compartment syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-adults/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>].

This reinforces the importance of calculating fluid resuscitation needs carefully and of continually adjusting resuscitation efforts according to the physiologic response.

Patients with major burns should have two large-bore intravenous (IV) lines placed through unburned skin, if possible, and may require central venous access. IV lines can be placed through burned tissue if necessary to avoid delays in resuscitation. The classification of burns is described in the accompanying figures and discussed in detail separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F73309\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73309 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57124\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57124 \">table 2</a>).

LR contains physiologic concentrations of major electrolytes, and lactate may reduce the incidence of hyperchloremic acidosis that can occur with administration of large volumes of isotonic saline (ie, 0.9 percent sodium chloride). Hartmann&rsquo;s solution, another isotonic solution that differs slightly from LR in its concentrations of lactate and electrolytes, is also used. </p><p>The use of colloids or hypertonic saline during initial resuscitation is controversial. No differences in mortality were identified in a systematic review that included metaanalyses comparing crystalloids with: albumin or plasma protein fraction, hydroxyethylstarch, and modified gelatin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Similarly, no mortality differences were identified for hypertonic compared with isotonic crystalloid. However, among 25 trials, hydroxyethyl starch increased the risk of death compared with crystalloid (risk ratio 1.10, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.19). In a separate systematic review, in a metaanalysis of four trials, mean load (volume <span class=\"nowrap\">[mL]/percent</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">TBSA/weight</span> [kg]) 24 hours following burn injury was lower for hyperosmotic fluid compared with isosmotic fluid (LR) without altering renal function or mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The hyperosmotic fluids included hypertonic saline, or LR plus albumin, fresh frozen plasma or hydroxyethyl starch. Additional trials are needed to determine whether any of the hyperosmotic fluids result in better outcomes than the others.</p><p>Following initial resuscitation efforts, IV fluids are given to meet baseline fluid needs and maintain urine output (0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour). Any change to the infusion rate is made as gradually as possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Should urine output fall below or other clinical parameters suggest inadequate resuscitation, additional fluid is infused. In such a circumstance, a bolus of IV crystalloid (approximately 500 to 1000 mL) is given and the infusion of crystalloid increased by approximately 20 to 30 percent. While adequate fluid resuscitation is crucial, care should be taken not to over-resuscitate. If adequate resuscitation has been achieved and the patient is stabilized, the crystalloid solution can be changed to 5 percent dextrose in one-half isotonic saline (ie, 0.45 percent sodium chloride) with 20 mEq of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium chloride</a> per liter given at a maintenance rate to keep urine output at or above 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour. Clinicians should continue to monitor the patient's fluid status closely. &#160;</p><p>Enteral resuscitation may be a useful treatment for burn shock patients when IV therapy is unavailable, such as with large scale disasters. The World Health Organization (WHO) Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) has been used successfully to resuscitate animals with 40 percent TBSA burns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

Superficial (epidermal) burns (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57124\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57124 \">table 2</a>) are excluded from this calculation. One-half of the calculated fluid need is given in the first eight hours, and the remaining half is given over the subsequent 16 hours. The rate of infusion for IV resuscitation fluid should be as constant as possible; sharp decreases in infusion rates can lead to vascular collapse and an increase in edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p>In addition to calculators (like the one above), a nomogram has been developed to help clinicians rapidly determine fluid requirements according to the Parkland formula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

The Galveston formula may allow for more accurate calculation of the initial fluid resuscitation children require. It is discussed separately.

Monitoring urine output using an indwelling bladder catheter (eg, Foley catheter) is a readily available means of assessing fluid resuscitation. Hourly urine output should be maintained at 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/hr</span> in adults. Patients with minimal or no urine output after sustaining severe burns, despite appropriate fluid resuscitation, generally do not survive.</p><p>Clinical signs of volume status, such as heart rate, blood pressure, pulse pressure, distal pulses, capillary refill, and color and turgor of uninjured skin are monitored every hour for the first 24 hours. Inadequate fluid resuscitation is the most common cause of diminished distal pulses in the newly burned patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Another potential cause of diminished pulses is peripheral edema, which develops in many severe burn patients due to the large fluid volumes needed for resuscitation. As edema increases, elevated compartment pressures can compromise distal circulation and may require escharotomy. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Escharotomy'</a> below.)</p><p>Specific laboratory measurements such as mixed venous blood gas and serum lactate concentration are additional important guides to the adequacy of resuscitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. A decrease in mixed venous oxygen saturation and an increase in serum lactate suggest inadequate end-organ perfusion (elevated serum lactate can also occur with carbon monoxide or cyanide poisoning).

Although a number of parameters exist to guide the timing of extremity escharotomies, most often the decision is made clinically based upon the presence of constrictive wounds and compromised distal perfusion. Constrictive swelling does not occur until fluid resuscitation is underway (typically a minimum of three to four hours is needed), and escharotomy is rarely required in the immediate aftermath of a burn. If transfer of a patient with severe or circumferential burns is delayed, extremities should be reassessed to determine whether escharotomies are needed prior to departure to ensure continued distal perfusion. Assessment of distal perfusion may include examination of capillary refill, distal pulses (by palpation or Doppler ultrasound), skin temperature, tissue pliability, and pulse oximetry. Pulse oximetry above 90 percent suggests there is adequate distal perfusion and no need for escharotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-adults/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Escharotomy incisions may be performed with coagulation electrocautery, which causes less bleeding, or a scalpel. Extremity incisions should extend through the eschar to the fatty tissue just beneath, but no further; fascia should be left intact. Adequate incisions should improve distal circulation. If perfusion fails to improve after the procedure, the clinician should reassess the escharotomy depth and location, and any incisions deemed insufficiently deep should be re-incised. If the escharotomy is adequate but perfusion remains poor, elevated compartment pressures may be contributing and should be measured. Guidance from a burn surgeon by phone can be helpful. </p><p>Clinicians should keep in mind the distinction between escharotomy, an incision through the eschar only, and fasciotomy, which involves incisions through all involved fascial layers and is performed to treat acute compartment syndrome (ACS) of the extremities.

Proper management during their initial resuscitation reduces such risk (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51484\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef51484 \">algorithm 1</a>). Below are listed critical points in the initial management of patients with severe thermal injury. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Airway, breathing, and circulation &ndash; Perform a primary trauma survey with appropriate management (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51484\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef51484 \">algorithm 1</a>). Look for evidence of respiratory distress and smoke inhalation injury, a common cause of death in the acute burn victim. Initial assessment may reveal no evidence of injury, but laryngeal edema can develop suddenly and unexpectedly. Aggressive airway management with early intubation is warranted if there is evidence of inhalation injury. Signs and symptoms of inhalation injury are described above. Obtain a chest radiograph, arterial blood gas, and electrocardiogram in all patients at risk for respiratory problems. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Airway management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory studies and monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Burn depth and size determine fluid resuscitation and the need for transfer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F74855\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74855 \">table 1</a>). They must be accurately assessed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-burn-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of burn injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Burn shock &ndash; Vascular collapse from burn shock is a critical component of the pathophysiologic response to severe burns. Rapid, aggressive fluid resuscitation to reconstitute intravascular volume and maintain end-organ perfusion is crucial. Fluid requirements are based initially upon a formula (eg, Parkland) and subsequently upon <strong>patient response</strong> to the initial intravenous (IV) fluids. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Fluid resuscitation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial, estimated fluid requirements &ndash; We suggest using lactated ringers for fluid resuscitation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The Parkland-Baxter formula can be used to calculate initial fluid needs. According to this formula, the fluid requirement during the initial 24 hours of treatment is 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of body weight for each percent of TBSA burned, given IV (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-adult-burn-injury-fluid-resuscitation-parkland-crystalloid-estimate\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). Superficial (epidermal) burns are excluded from this calculation. One-half of the calculated fluid need is given in the first eight hours, and the remaining half is given over the subsequent 16 hours. The rate of infusion for IV resuscitation fluid should be as constant as possible; rapid declines in infusion rates can lead to vascular collapse and an increase in edema. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Estimating initial fluid requirements'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitoring fluid status &ndash; Monitor urine output using an indwelling bladder catheter (eg, Foley catheter). Hourly urine output should be maintained at 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> in adults. Clinical signs of volume status, such as heart rate, blood pressure, pulse pressure, distal pulses, capillary refill, and color and turgor of uninjured skin are monitored every hour for the first 24 hours. Inadequate fluid resuscitation is the most common cause of diminished distal pulses in the newly burned patient. A decrease in mixed venous oxygen saturation and an increase in serum lactate suggest inadequate end-organ perfusion. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring fluid status'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carbon monoxide and cyanide &ndash; Burn patients may be exposed to carbon monoxide, requiring immediate treatment with high-flow oxygen (and possibly hyperbaric oxygen), and cyanide, requiring antidotal therapy. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Carbon monoxide and cyanide'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wound care &ndash; Cool and clean wounds, but avoid inducing hypothermia in this process. Mild soap and water is suitable. Monitor the patient's core temperature continually. Remove any jewelry and any hot or burned clothing and obvious debris not densely adherent to the skin. Irrigation with cool water may be used. <strong>Topical</strong> antibiotics are applied to all nonsuperficial burns. If the patient is immediately transferred to a burn center, burns are covered with clean, dry dressings and antibiotics are applied at the burn center. There is no role for prophylactic IV antibiotics. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Wound management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain control and additional interventions &ndash; Give opioids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a>) to treat pain and give tetanus prophylaxis. Extremely high doses of opioids may be required. Benzodiazepines can help relieve anxiety. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Chemoprophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coordination with burn team &ndash; Emergency clinicians should coordinate patient care closely with either the admitting or, in the case of transfer, with the accepting burn team. A number of additional medications may be of benefit, but most are begun after the patient has left the emergency department. We institute glycemic control using an insulin drip as early as possible. Additional treatments to minimize the catabolic response should be initiated in close consultation with the burn team that will assume care of the patient. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Modulating the catabolic response'</a> above and <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal interventions'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Brigham PA, McLoughlin E.
