Meningitis happens when the tissues that surround the brain and spinal cord (called the &quot;meninges&quot;) get infected. This can occur after a child has an infection in another part of the body. The germs can travel through the blood to the tissues that surround the brain and spinal cord.</p><p>There are 2 main types of meningitis, depending on which germs are causing the infection. &quot;Bacterial meningitis&quot; is caused by bacteria. &quot;Viral meningitis&quot; is caused by viruses.</p><p>It is important that doctors figure out if a child has bacterial or viral meningitis. This is because bacterial meningitis is a medical emergency. If bacterial meningitis is not treated quickly, it can lead to brain problems such as deafness or learning problems. Bacterial meningitis can even lead to death. Viral meningitis is usually less serious, and does not usually lead to long-term brain problems or death.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H728529762\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of meningitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bacterial and viral meningitis can cause many of the same symptoms. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stiff neck</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea or vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acting confused, or being hard to wake up</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having light bother a person's eyes</p><p/><p>Newborn babies can also have other symptoms that include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not feeding well</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A bulging soft spot on the skull</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being more sleepy or acting more upset than usual</p><p/><p>Sometimes, bacterial and viral meningitis have different symptoms. Children with bacterial meningitis might have seizures or red-purple spots on the skin. Children with viral meningitis might have a runny nose, muscle aches, cough, or a red-pink rash.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H728529769\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I bring my child to the doctor?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you think that your child might have meningitis, bring him or her to the doctor or hospital right away.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H728529776\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for meningitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Doctors can do different tests to figure out if a child has meningitis and what type it is. Tests can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Lumbar puncture,&quot; also known as a spinal tap &ndash; During this procedure, a doctor puts a thin needle in the lower back and removes a small amount of spinal fluid. Spinal fluid is the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. He or she will do lab tests on the spinal fluid.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CT scan, or other imaging tests &ndash; Imaging tests can create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H728529783\"><span class=\"h1\">How is meningitis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on the type of meningitis.</p><p>Bacterial meningitis is treated in the hospital with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotic medicines that go into a child's vein</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other treatments, such as medicines to keep the blood pressure normal</p><p/><p>Viral meningitis is not treated with antibiotics. That's because antibiotics do not kill viruses. Treatment for viral meningitis includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rest</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drinking fluids</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicine to reduce the fever and headache</p><p/><p>It can take a few days for test results to show whether a child has bacterial or viral meningitis. But bacterial meningitis needs to be treated quickly, so doctors usually start antibiotics right away. Then, doctors wait for the test results to know if they should continue or stop the antibiotics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H728529790\"><span class=\"h1\">Can meningitis be spread from one person to another?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The bacteria and viruses that cause meningitis can be spread from one person to another.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H728529797\"><span class=\"h1\">Can meningitis be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To help reduce the chance of getting meningitis, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make sure that your child gets the vaccines your doctor or nurse recommends &ndash; Certain vaccines can reduce the chance of your child getting meningitis.</p><p/><p>If someone in your home has meningitis, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid spreading germs &ndash; For example, wash your hands before eating, and do not share cups or silverware.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ask your doctor or nurse about taking antibiotics &ndash; Sometimes doctors prescribe antibiotics for other people at home to prevent them from getting meningitis. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4261466\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Fever in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=headaches-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Headaches in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ear-infections-otitis-media-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Ear infections (otitis media) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sinusitis-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sinusitis in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=flu-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Flu (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Seizures (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-meningitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bacterial meningitis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=viral-meningitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Viral meningitis (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=meningitis-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Meningitis in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-infants-and-children-age-0-to-6-years-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vaccines for infants and children age 0 to 6 years (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-children-age-7-to-18-years-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vaccines for children age 7 to 18 years (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-symptoms-and-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Influenza symptoms and treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
