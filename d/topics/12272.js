It consists of nearly 60 plasma and membrane proteins that form three distinct but overlapping activating pathways, as well as a common terminal lytic cascade and a network of regulators and receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-clinical-assessment-of-the-complement-system/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>This topic review will discuss the functions of the complement system, the pathways involved, the measurement of complement activity, and the clinical significance of abnormally low or high complement tests.

Thus, nearly one-half of complement proteins function to regulate (control) the system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H971405917\"><span class=\"h1\">NOMENCLATURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complement components were commonly named as they were identified, leading to some inconsistencies in terminology. An updated nomenclature has been suggested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-clinical-assessment-of-the-complement-system/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Components of the classical pathway are designated by the capital letter &quot;C&quot; combined with a number (eg, C1, C2, C3, and C4). This scheme is also used for components of the membrane attack complex (MAC) (C5, C6, C7, C8, and C9). The numbers are in order of reactivity, except that C4 is activated before C2 and C3 in the classical and lectin pathways.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alternative pathway components are designated as factors, such as factor B and factor D.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upon proteolytic activation, a liberated smaller fragment is designated by a lowercase letter (such as C3a or Ba). The larger fragment attaches to a target and is then listed with a &quot;b,&quot; as in C3b or Bb.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inactivation by limited proteolysis produces further breakdown products designated with additional lowercase letters. For example, C3c and C3d are produced when C3b is cleaved.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Receptors are variably defined by their function (eg, immune adherence receptor), order of discovery (eg, complement receptor type 1 [CR1]), ligands to which they bind (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">C3b/C4b</span> receptor), or via their &quot;cluster of differentiation&quot; (CD) assignments (CR1 is CD35). Receptors have a more limited expression pattern (ie, usually expressed only by hematopoietic cells).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Membrane regulators are widely expressed, including by hematopoietic cells, and are named via the same designations as indicated above (eg, the designation of decay-accelerating factor [DAF] as CD55 or membrane cofactor protein [MCP] as CD46). Plasma regulators, on the other hand, are synthesized primarily by the liver, such as factors H and I and C4b binding protein (C4BP).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHWAYS AND ACTIVATING CONDITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are three major divisions or pathways of complement activation: the classical, lectin, and alternative cascades (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F56374\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56374 \">figure 1</a>). Each is triggered in a distinct manner, yet all lead to the activation of C3 and its deposition on a target as C3b, which is the major goal of complement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-clinical-assessment-of-the-complement-system/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Classical</strong> &ndash; The classical pathway is triggered by antibodies. It becomes engaged when immunoglobulin M (IgM) or immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies bind to antigens (such as viruses, bacteria, or autoantigens). The C1q subcomponent of the C1 complex attaches to the Fc portion of antibody. In complex with C1q are the two proteases C1r and C1s. Upon C1q engagement by antibodies, C1r autoactivates and cleaves C1s, which subsequently cleaves C4 and C2, the next two proteins in the cascade. IgG subclasses 1 and 3 efficiently fix complement. IgG2 fixes complement, although less efficiently than IgG1 or IgG3. In addition to antibodies, C-reactive protein and a few other plasma proteins can engage the classical pathway. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=igg-subclasses-physical-properties-genetics-and-biologic-functions#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;IgG subclasses: Physical properties, genetics, and biologic functions&quot;, section on 'Biologic functions'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lectin</strong> &ndash; The lectin pathway is specialized for the prompt recognition of repetitive patterns of carbohydrates on the surface of microbial pathogen targets. The activation scheme of the lectin pathway is similar to the classical pathway, except that the initiating antibodies are replaced by lectins (ie, carbohydrate-binding proteins). While C1q is the major pattern recognition molecule (PRM) of the classical pathway, the list of PRMs for the lectin pathway has been growing since the discovery of mannose-binding lectin (MBL, also called mannan-binding lectin) and include ficolin-1, ficolin-2, ficolin-3, collectin-10, and collectin-11 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-clinical-assessment-of-the-complement-system/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Also associated with the large PRMs (such as MBL) are serine proteases (ie, MBL-associated serine proteases [MASPs]), which are structurally and functionally similar to the classical pathway subcomponent proteases of C1 (ie, C1r and C1s). Also, like C1s in the classical pathway, the MASPs activate C4 and C2 by proteolytic cleavage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-clinical-assessment-of-the-complement-system/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Alternative</strong> &ndash; The alternative pathway is an ancient surveillance system and represents the original extracellular complement system. It does not require the presence of antibodies or lectins to become activated. It is continuously turning over (so called &quot;tickover&quot;) at a low level due to the presence of a labile thioester bond in C3. This may result in deposition of C3b on a target and engagement of the alternative pathway's feedback loop mechanism. C3 &quot;ticks over&quot; at approximately 1 percent per hour in blood. If this form of C3 lands on healthy self-tissues, it is rapidly inactivated by host regulators. If it engages cell debris or a pathogen, it is amplified by the feedback loop of the alternative pathway. If it does not engage a target, within a few microseconds, it is hydrolyzed and altered by plasma (fluid-phase) regulators to facilitate removal from the circulation.</p><p/><p>All three pathways lead to C3b deposition on a target and then the assembly of the membrane attack complex (MAC). The MAC perturbs cell membrane integrity and in organisms such as gram-negative bacteria, results in lysis of the microbe. Also, each pathway promotes the inflammatory response by releasing proinflammatory peptides known as anaphylatoxins (C3a, C4a, C5a). While C3a and C5a are well-recognized anaphylatoxins with known receptors, C4a also has been found to be a ligand for protease-activated receptors 1 and 4 (PAR1 and PAR4), with effects on cellular activation and endothelial permeability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-clinical-assessment-of-the-complement-system/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. A more detailed discussion of the each pathway is available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complement-pathways\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complement pathways&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1300682591\"><span class=\"h1\">FUNCTIONS OF THE COMPLEMENT SYSTEM</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1300682688\"><span class=\"h2\">Destruction of microbes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary goal of the complement system is the elimination of microbes and secondarily, other particulates that represent debris. The process requires the covalent deposition of C3b on a target. Targets can include microbes, immune aggregates, apoptotic cells, and necrotic tissue. The process of coating of targets with complement molecules to promote their elimination is known as opsonization. Opsonization occurs rapidly. In less than five minutes, several million C3b fragments may be deposited on a single bacterium.</p><p>Once a target is coated with C3b, it can then be recognized by host cells bearing complement receptors. The process of C3b on a target engaging its receptors is known as the immune adherence reaction. It is commonly followed by ingestion on phagocytic cells or transfer from erythrocytes (that express the <span class=\"nowrap\">C3b/C4b</span> receptor, complement receptor type 1 [CR1]) to tissue macrophages in the liver and spleen. Further, CR1 converts C3b to iC3b and C3dg fragments, thereby facilitating transfers to CR2, CR3, and CR4.</p><p>Opsonization also facilitates the adaptive immune response, including antigen presentation and retention by immune cells, as well as immunologic memory and costimulation of B lymphocytes through the antigen receptor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-humoral-immune-response#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The humoral immune response&quot;, section on 'Activation signals'</a>.)</p><p>Based on this host defense profile, it becomes apparent why infections and autoimmunity are two major consequences of a defective complement system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H351736746\"><span class=\"h2\">Clearance of cellular debris and apoptotic cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Programmed cell death (apoptosis) followed by rapid phagocytic clearance is a common mechanism, whereby organisms dispose of dead and dying cells. The process of apoptosis results in alterations in the architecture of the cell membrane, as well as loss of host regulators. These changes expose sites for binding by lectins and natural antibodies and induce complement activation and immune clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-clinical-assessment-of-the-complement-system/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1300682717\"><span class=\"h2\">Promotion of inflammation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Activation of the complement system leads to the release of peptides of approximately 10 kDa, which are potent mediators of inflammatory and immune responses. These fragments, known as &quot;anaphylatoxins,&quot; bind to their respective receptors on cells to initiate inflammation and vasodilation that in turn activate many cell types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-clinical-assessment-of-the-complement-system/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Functions of anaphylatoxins include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Directed movement of motile cells to an inflammatory site (ie, chemotaxis and chemokinesis of polymorphonuclear leukocytes [granulocytes])</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Release of mediators, such as histamine from mast cells</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Activation of many cell types, including epithelial and endothelial cells, as well as cells involved in inflammatory and immune responses</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contraction of smooth muscles</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dilation of blood vessels with exudation of plasma and cells</p><p/><p>A development in the anaphylatoxin field is the discovery that C3a and C4a (although not C5a) have direct antimicrobial activity and that this property has been preserved throughout vertebrate evolution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-clinical-assessment-of-the-complement-system/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This finding provides an additional mechanism through which complement can kill micro-organisms. Further, as noted above, the long sought after receptor for C4a has been identified as the protease-activated receptors 1 and 4 (PAR1 and PAR4), revealing another indication of the importance of cross-talk between the complement system and other host defense pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-clinical-assessment-of-the-complement-system/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1300682765\"><span class=\"h2\">Other functions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to its key role in host defense, complement participates in several other beneficial processes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Clearance of immune complexes</strong> &ndash; Complement activation leads to deposition of activation fragments (C4b and C3b) on immune complexes. These are subsequently cleared by complement receptors on hematopoietic cells and tissue macrophages. Serum sickness is an example of activation of complement by immune complexes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=serum-sickness-and-serum-sickness-like-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Serum sickness and serum sickness-like reactions&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Angiogenesis</strong> &ndash; Complement activation leads to the generation of the proinflammatory anaphylatoxins. They, in turn, cause release of mediators, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (sVEGFR1) from multiple cell types, including monocytes and macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-clinical-assessment-of-the-complement-system/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In mouse models of retinopathy of prematurity, these mediators surprisingly played an inhibitory role and induced an antiangiogenic signature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-clinical-assessment-of-the-complement-system/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. On the other hand and in apparent contrast, complement can also lead to neovascularization as seen in the retina of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=age-related-macular-degeneration-clinical-presentation-etiology-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Age-related macular degeneration: Clinical presentation, etiology, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H1300682751\" class=\"local\">'Detrimental functions'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells</strong> &ndash; Our understanding of the most primitive of hematopoietic progenitor cells, human stem cells (HSCs), has fundamentally changed. We know that HSCs are first responders during infection, and their regulation by proinflammatory cytokines helps maintain homeostasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-clinical-assessment-of-the-complement-system/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. By generation of proinflammatory anaphylatoxins, complement activation can indirectly promote HSC mobilization via granulocyte egress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-clinical-assessment-of-the-complement-system/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tissue regeneration</strong> &ndash; While the mammalian liver is one of the few organs capable of regeneration, complement has a role in this process, such as by modulating stem cell responses via anaphylatoxin receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-clinical-assessment-of-the-complement-system/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Other lines of investigation (especially from animal models) suggest a more subtle role of complement in basic development, vertebrate embryogenesis, and tissue homeostasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-clinical-assessment-of-the-complement-system/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intracellular complement</strong> &ndash; An intracellular complement system has been identified (reviewed in [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-clinical-assessment-of-the-complement-system/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]). This system mounts a potent intracellular immune response to nonenveloped viruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-clinical-assessment-of-the-complement-system/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The deposition and covalent attachment of C3 onto pathogens in the extracellular compartment serves as a marker upon intracellular invasion. The C3 fragments are recognized by an unknown receptor in the cytosol to signal the inflammasome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-clinical-assessment-of-the-complement-system/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Further, C3 activation can occur intracellularly, resulting in the production of autocrine-produced proinflammatory cytokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-clinical-assessment-of-the-complement-system/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Additionally, T cells also possess intracellular C5 stores that are cleaved to C5a, which then binds its receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-clinical-assessment-of-the-complement-system/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p>Although complement is involved in these and other processes, complement-deficient humans develop two major problems: bacterial infections and autoimmunity (primarily systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]). Therefore, the two main functions of the complement system are host defense against pathogens and prevention of autoimmunity to nuclear constituents. C3-deficient humans are <strong>not</strong> known to have developmental problems, defects in hemostasis or angiogenesis, or problems with wound healing, which suggests that the role of complement in these processes may be less critical.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1300682751\"><span class=\"h2\">Detrimental functions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In pathologic conditions featuring autoantibodies and immune complexes, complement activation contributes to cell and tissue damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-clinical-assessment-of-the-complement-system/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. In acute injury states (membrane damage, apoptosis, necrosis), the system plays an important role in the host's response to altered self. Failure of this clearance role predisposes to autoimmunity, particularly SLE. Complement activation occurring in early pregnancy predicts an adverse outcome in patients with SLE <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> antiphospholipid antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-clinical-assessment-of-the-complement-system/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Similarly, the proper handling of self-debris is also associated with other common illnesses of the developed world, including AMD (retinal debris), atherosclerosis <span class=\"nowrap\">(lipoproteins/lipids),</span> Alzheimer disease (misfolded <span class=\"nowrap\">protein/amyloid),</span> and gout (urate crystals) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-clinical-assessment-of-the-complement-system/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>].</p><p>While the complement system is engaged in these common diseases of aging humans, its role in pathogenesis is uncertain. Complement deposits at the sites of lipoproteinaceous debris, such as plaques, but this may largely be a bystander process. In contrast, there are unequivocal genetic data implicating the complement system's alternative pathway in the pathogenesis of AMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-clinical-assessment-of-the-complement-system/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=age-related-macular-degeneration-clinical-presentation-etiology-and-diagnosis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Age-related macular degeneration: Clinical presentation, etiology, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>Complement component C4 variation has been linked to the development of schizophrenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-clinical-assessment-of-the-complement-system/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. C4 is a duplicated gene and 1 of approximately 300 human genes that feature copy number variation. Increasing copies of the C4A gene were shown to be associated with the development of schizophrenia. C4 localized to neuronal synapses may trigger runaway pruning of the communications infrastructure. Thus, these results implicated excessive complement activity in the development of schizophrenia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=schizophrenia-in-adults-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis#H31673376\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Schizophrenia in adults: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Genetic risk factors'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLEMENT MEASUREMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complement levels are evaluated by antigenic and functional assays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-clinical-assessment-of-the-complement-system/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. The most frequently used complement tests are immunoassays for antigenic levels of C3 and C4 and functional assessment via the total hemolytic complement (THC or CH50). Functional assays are also commercially available for the lectin pathway and alternative pathway.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">CH50</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The total hemolytic complement (THC or CH50) assesses the ability of serum to lyse sheep erythrocytes optimally sensitized with rabbit immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody. All nine components of the classical pathway (C1 through C9) are required to give a normal CH50. CH50 is therefore a useful screening tool for detecting a deficiency of the classical pathway, resulting from either an inherited defect of a single component or from activation of a pathway, leading to lowered levels of several components. It does not assess the entire alternative pathway, because factors B and D and properdin are not required for the classical pathway activation. They are early components of only the alternative pathway.</p><p>A normal CH50 <span class=\"nowrap\">value/titer</span> ranges from 150 to 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> in a commonly employed functional (hemolytic) assay system. The titer is the reciprocal of the dilution of serum required to lyse 50 percent of the antibody-coated sheep erythrocytes (eg, a CH50 titer of 200 units means that the human test serum lysed 50 percent of the erythrocytes at a dilution of 1:200).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1300682824\"><span class=\"h3\">Low CH50</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A very low or zero CH50 can result from a genetic deficiency of one or more complement proteins in the classical pathway. Less dramatic reductions in CH50 are seen in pathologic processes secondary to immune complex formation. It is the classical pathway that is most commonly involved in these autoantibody-mediated diseases. The underlying problem is the production of the autoantibody. In this case, the complement system is responding as it was intended to do.</p><p>The following are clinical examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A child presents with recurrent pyogenic bacterial infections in the setting of a normal white blood cell count and normal gamma globulin levels. An extremely low CH50 value (eg, &le;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL)</span> is consistent with a homozygous deficiency of a classical pathway component. C1q, C4, C2, or C3 deficiency could present this way. If the infecting organism is a Neisserial species, then C5, C6, C7, C8, or C9 deficiency should also be considered. If the child is male with a family history of Neisserial infections and the CH50 is normal, diagnosis of properdin deficiency should be considered. The clinical presentations of inherited complement deficiencies are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inherited-disorders-of-the-complement-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inherited disorders of the complement system&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less dramatic reductions in the CH50 are characteristic of activation of the classical pathway (as may be seen in systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]), reflecting consumption by immune complexes more rapidly than the components can be replaced by the liver. CH50 is also moderately reduced in neonates, as it takes several years to reach adult levels. (See <a href=\"#H1934416595\" class=\"local\">'Impact of age on complement pathways'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1300682906\"><span class=\"h4\">Laboratory error</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A common cause of a low CH50 is improper specimen handling. The CH50 assay requires appropriate collection, processing, and storage of specimens, since several complement proteins are unstable.

This assay is similar to the CH50 but measures lysis of unsensitized rabbit red blood cells under conditions that allow <strong>only</strong> alternative pathway activation. It can be performed in referral laboratories. The most common indication for obtaining an AH50 is the evaluation of certain renal diseases in childhood, especially those featuring a thrombotic microangiopathy or glomerulonephritis. Additionally, a very low or undetectable AH50 occurs in patients with factor B or factor D deficiency who almost always present with Neisserial infections. Note that properdin, a positive regulator of complement, is not assessed in some AH50 assays, while in others, it is required. Further, the gene for properdin is on the X chromosome. Thus, males are affected, and there is commonly a positive family history. As noted, the alternative pathway's AH50 and the classical pathway's CH50 will be very low or undetectable in C5, C6, C7, C8, or C9 deficiency, since the terminal cascade is common to both pathways.

Their role in routine clinical practice, such as for monitoring SLE, remains to be established. The measurement of split products has two advantages over the measurement of whole components. Split products are not affected by the acute-phase response, since they are only produced by complement activation.

The pattern of complement abnormalities can provide diagnostic clues to the underlying disease process (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F50281\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50281 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11396743\"><span class=\"h2\">Classical pathway activation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Classical pathway activation is commonly indicated by low levels of C4 and C3. Another pattern seen with classical pathway activation is low C4 and normal C3.</p><p>There are three common explanations for how levels of C4 can be reduced in the setting of normal C3:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The basal concentration of serum C3 is three to six times higher than that of C4. Thus, classical pathway activation may lower the C4 out of the normal range, while the amount of C3 is reduced but remains within normal limits. The clinician is unlikely to recognize this point initially, since a patient's predisease C3 concentration is rarely known. To illustrate, a systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patient could have a predisease C3 level of 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> which decreases to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> at clinical onset of disease. Thus, C3 remains in the &quot;normal range,&quot; despite considerable C3 consumption, while C4 is below the normal range.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In hereditary angioedema, C1 excessively cleaves C4 and C2 in plasma because of a deficiency of the C1 inhibitor. However, a C3 convertase does not form efficiently in plasma (fluid phase) because the complement system is designed to work on a biologic membrane. Thus, patients with hereditary angioedema have very low C4 but normal C3. A similar phenomenon may occur in syndromes involving excessive soluble immune complexes, such as mixed cryoglobulinemia, SLE, and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. In this situation, the C3 convertase would form on a soluble immune complex, and this is inefficient in developing C3 convertases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The third mechanism by which C4 can be reduced in the setting of normal C3 is genetic partial deficiency of C4. This is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inherited-disorders-of-the-complement-system#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inherited disorders of the complement system&quot;, section on 'C4 deficiency'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Therefore, the finding of low C4 and normal C3 should prompt consideration of SLE, mixed cryoglobulinemia, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis types I and III, and hereditary or acquired angioedema. The combination of a low C4, normal C3, and a positive test for cryoglobulins should prompt further investigation for the presence of hepatitis B and C.

Complement activation via alternative pathway activation is uncommon in clinical medicine. However, the combination of low C3 and normal C4 in a patient with an <span class=\"nowrap\">inflammatory/vasculitic</span> disease process, especially with kidney involvement, almost always indicates alternative pathway activation. This can be further confirmed by measuring factor B <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an AH50. Both factor B and the AH50 should be low. However, tests for factor B and the AH50 are not widely available and will need to be sent to a commercial laboratory.

Immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclasses 2 and 4 do not efficiently activate the classical pathway. However, upon binding antigens, they can provide a protected (from regulators) site to allow for activation of the alternative pathway. A second point is that two antibody molecules (possibly up to six) need to be in close proximity to bind the C1q subunit of the C1 complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-and-clinical-assessment-of-the-complement-system/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

Alternative pathway activation commonly occurs at the onset of dialysis and heart-lung bypass but is transient and rarely of clinical significance.

Each pathway is activated by a different mechanism. The major goal of all three cascades is the deposition of substantial quantities of C3b on a target (opsonization), which marks it for elimination. Engagement of each pathway also leads to the release of proinflammatory anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a) and assembly of the membrane attack complex (MAC).

A homozygous deficiency of classical pathway components is indicated by an extremely low CH50 value (&le;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL)</span>. Less dramatic reductions in CH50 are seen in pathologic processes secondary to immune complex formation. A low CH50 can also result from laboratory error and &quot;cold activation.&quot; (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'CH50'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The measurement of C3 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> C4 can assist in the diagnosis of certain diseases (especially SLE), as well as in monitoring the course of the disease. Other diseases featuring autoantibodies leading to immune complex formation are the antiphospholipid syndrome, mixed cryoglobulinemia, Sj&ouml;gren syndrome, and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. Low C4 and C3 or low C3 alone can indicate the presence of any of these disorders. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Serum C3 and C4 levels'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic deficiencies (usually haploinsufficiency of complement inhibitory proteins) leading to excessive activation of the alternative pathway have been identified in atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), C3 glomerulopathy, and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Genetic variation in the copy number of C4 genes in the brain is associated with increased risk of schizophrenia. (See <a href=\"#H11396752\" class=\"local\">'Alternative pathway activation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A monoclonal antibody to C5 is available to treat paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and aHUS. Many novel therapeutic agents are in development to treat undesirable complement activation.
