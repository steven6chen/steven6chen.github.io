The insoluble precipitate can then be separated from the liquids by centrifugation. It is re-frozen at -18&deg;C in a concentrated volume of approximately 10 to 20 mL as one unit of Cryoprecipitate. The official name of the final product is Cryoprecipitated AHF (for &quot;antihemophilic factor&quot;), although this is commonly abbreviated &quot;cryoprecipitate&quot; or &quot;cryo.&quot; This product can be stored, frozen, for up to one year.</p><p>Cryoprecipitate can only be made from FFP, which has been frozen within eight hours of blood collection; it cannot be made from PF24 (plasma that was frozen within 24 hours of whole blood collection). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H933090127\"><span class=\"h1\">CONSTITUENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cryoprecipitate contains most of the fibrinogen (factor I), factor VIII, factor XIII, von Willebrand factor (VWF), and fibronectin derived from one unit of Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP). Thus, one unit of Cryoprecipitate contains the following proteins in a volume of approximately 5 to 20 mL:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fibrinogen &ndash; &gt;150 mg of fibrinogen (range: 150 to 250 mg); half-life: 100 to 150 hours</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factor VIII &ndash; &gt;80 international units (range: 80 to 150 units); half-life: 12 hours</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factor XIII &ndash; 50 to 75 units; half-life of 150 to 300 hours</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>von Willebrand factor &ndash; 100 to 150 units; half-life: 24 hours</p><p/><p>Fibronectin is also present, although there is no dosage requirement and the concentration is not measured. &#160;</p><p>At the request of the transfusing facility, most blood suppliers will provide pre-pooled Cryoprecipitate (one &quot;bag&quot;) containing the Cryoprecipitate obtained from 5, 6, 8, or 10 units of FFP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3754689884\"><span class=\"h1\">ADMINISTRATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1287857198\"><span class=\"h2\">Dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, one unit of Cryoprecipitate is derived from one unit of donated blood, in a volume of 5 to 20 mL. Since Cryoprecipitate can be provided as single units or as &quot;pools&quot; containing multiple units, the clinician should calculate the appropriate dose based on single units and let the transfusion service provide those units in the most efficient packaging (multiple single units or [most often] pooled units).</p><p>For most adult patients, an appropriate dose of Cryoprecipitate is one to two five-unit &quot;pools,&quot; equivalent to 5 to 10 units (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F53854\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53854 \">table 1</a>). Thus, a typical dose is provided in a volume of 50 to 200 mL. In the average patient, each unit raises the plasma fibrinogen concentration by at least 7 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL;</span> thus, 10 units will raise the fibrinogen by approximately 70 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in a 70 kg recipient. For factor XIII deficiency, a typical dose to treat bleeding is approximately one unit (bag) per 10 kg of body weight (eg, one five-unit pool in a 50 kg person). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2446035175\"><span class=\"h2\">Infusion rate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The infusion rate for Cryoprecipitate is similar to other blood and plasma components (eg, 1 to 2 mL per minute in a patient without hypervolemia). In trauma cases or other emergent situations, the administration rate can be increased. Cryoprecipitate should be infused through a standard blood transfusion filter. No other medications or fluids other than normal saline should be given simultaneously through the same line without prior consultation with the medical director of the blood bank. </p><p>Cryoprecipitate must be thawed; thus, there is an approximately 10- to 30-minute delay before it can be administered. Once thawed, it must be transfused within six hours. If pooled after thawing, it must be transfused within four hours of pooling. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H642013618\"><span class=\"h2\">Dosing interval</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The dosing interval depends on the plasma half-life of the factor that is being replaced. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fibrinogen</strong> &ndash; The plasma half-life of fibrinogen is approximately 100 to 150 hours (approximately four to six days); dosing is generally based on monitoring of the relevant factor rather than a set dosing interval.

In contrast, Rh type need not be considered. A crossmatch is unnecessary. If transfusion with other blood components is anticipated, the requirement for ABO compatibility remains.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2065595443\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL USES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H431178599\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview of uses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical use of Cryoprecipitate has declined (or become obsolete) in some settings due to the availability of specific coagulation factor concentrates, fibrinogen concentrates, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> recombinant factor products that have a lower risk of complications such as viral infections, allergic transfusion reactions, and transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). In fact, largely as a result of safety concerns (particularly transmission of pathogens), many European countries have discontinued the use of Cryoprecipitate and rely solely on commercial fibrinogen concentrates for fibrinogen replacement therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-cryoprecipitate/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. </p><p>Cryoprecipitate is no longer routinely used to treat congenital hypofibrinogenemia, hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency), factor XIII deficiency, or von Willebrand disease (VWD), except in unusual circumstances (eg, treatment of bleeding when a recombinant or plasma-derived factor concentrate is not available).

Mortality was lower in the patients who received a higher ratio of fibrinogen to RBCs (24 versus 52 percent; p &lt;0.001). However, resource allocation may have taken into account the severity of injuries, and thus the groups may not have been balanced for their underlying mortality risk.</p><p/><p>The increasing use of fibrinogen concentrates as a source of fibrinogen in surgical patients is discussed in more detail separately.

A 2013 European guideline on the management of bleeding after major trauma recommended supplementation of fibrinogen if significant bleeding was accompanied by thromboelastometric signs of a functional fibrinogen deficit or a plasma fibrinogen level of &lt;150 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-cryoprecipitate/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

The resulting precipitate (Cryoprecipitated antihemophilic factor [AHF]; cryo) is then frozen and can be used for up to one year. (See <a href=\"#H1469548671\" class=\"local\">'Preparation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cryoprecipitate contains fibrinogen (factor I), factor VIII, fibronectin, factor XIII, and von Willebrand factor (VWF). (See <a href=\"#H933090127\" class=\"local\">'Constituents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cryoprecipitate can be provided as single units or as &quot;pools&quot; containing five or more units. The clinician should check with the local hospital transfusion service or blood supplier to determine the exact composition of one &quot;bag&quot; of Cryoprecipitate (eg, how many individual units are pooled to make up that &quot;bag&quot;) in order to determine the correct dosage for a patient. In the average patient, each unit raises the plasma fibrinogen concentration by approximately 7 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL;</span> thus, 10 units will raise the fibrinogen by approximately 70 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in a 70 kg recipient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F53854\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53854 \">table 1</a>).
