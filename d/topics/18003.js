Numerous inciting agents have been described including, but not limited to, agricultural dusts, bioaerosols, and certain reactive chemical species. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-causes-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and causes of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (extrinsic allergic alveolitis)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Because both environmental and host factors are involved in the production of the HP syndromes, management theoretically can involve modification of the environment or of the host immune response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prevention-and-prognosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, the pathogenesis of HP is incompletely understood, and emphasis on environmental control remains the cornerstone of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prevention-and-prognosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The prevention, treatment, and prognosis of HP will be reviewed here. The diagnosis of HP is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (extrinsic allergic alveolitis)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of HP can be reduced by diminishing exposure to provocative antigens. This may be accomplished by minimizing contact with potential inciting agents, reducing microbial contamination of the work or home environment, or using protective equipment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Reduction of antigenic burden</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alteration in the handling and storage of potential sources of microbial antigens can diminish the occurrence of HP. As examples, dispersion of actinomycetes spores is decreased by wetting compost prior to handling, and use of antimicrobial solutions in sugar cane processing diminishes fungal growth and the development of bagassosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Design of facilities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Indoor microbial contamination is usually related to problems with moisture control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prevention-and-prognosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Appropriate design of facilities may reduce stagnant water that is prone to microbial overgrowth. Thus, humidity in occupied buildings should be maintained below 60 percent, carpeting should be avoided in areas where persistent moisture is likely to be present, and water in heating, ventilating, and air conditioning systems should not be recirculated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Maintenance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preventive maintenance should be performed routinely in order to ensure that all heating, ventilation, and air conditioning equipment is properly maintained and that the indoor environment is clean. Portable humidifiers or vaporizers should be drained daily with removal of all slime, and sterilized frequently with either chlorine bleach or hydrogen peroxide&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prevention-and-prognosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>All water damage should be immediately repaired because microbial colonization occurs quickly and can be very difficult to eradicate. Water-damaged furnishings, drywall, and carpeting should be removed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Protective devices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Devices which limit inhalation of inciting antigens may be useful when complete elimination of these antigens is impossible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prevention-and-prognosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. As an example, the level of antigen exposure occasionally can be controlled by the appropriate use of environmental controls such as an electrostatic dust filter in the return ducts of a central air conditioning system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prevention-and-prognosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The efficacy of various types of personal respirators in preventing antigen sensitization and disease progression is unknown. Their use is most appropriate when avoidance of the causative antigen cannot easily and rapidly be achieved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prevention-and-prognosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Helmet-type powered air purifying respirators have been used to prevent episodic exposure in individuals with previous acute episodes of farmer's lung, but are cumbersome to wear for prolonged periods. Dust respirators offer poor protection against organic particulates and are not useful once sensitization has occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prevention-and-prognosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best studied forms of HP are farmer's lung and pigeon breeder's lung; treatment of other types of HP largely is extrapolated from the experiences in these populations. Antigen avoidance usually results in regression of disease, but glucocorticoid treatment may be required in more severe cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Antigen avoidance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Identification of the antigens responsible for a case of HP is of critical importance in managing the index case and for preventing sensitization of other individuals. Measures to minimize ongoing antigenic exposure should be undertaken as described above. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p>Complete elimination of allergen exposure sometimes is not possible without avoidance of the causative environment. Such a course may require relocation to a new job or home, but still may not guarantee improvement. We recommend that a patient with progression of disease in the context of ongoing exposure should be advised in the strongest terms to avoid the antigen by whatever means necessary. It is more difficult to determine the degree to which antigen avoidance is required when a patient has recovered completely, although possibly temporarily, from an initial episode of HP. The risk of recurrence is unclear in this setting, and drastic measures to avoid inciting antigens may not always be indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prevention-and-prognosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/4,5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,8</a>].</p><p>Farmer's lung poses particular problems because of the emotional and financial ramifications of leaving the farm environment. While a change of employment and residence may be necessary in persons with severe disease, several studies show that most farmers with HP do not progress clinically even if they do not modify their employment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prevention-and-prognosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/4,5,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,9</a>].</p><p>Similarly, persons with bird fancier's lung frequently are reluctant to give up their birds. If they do, recovery is not assured because high levels of bird antigens can be detected in the home environment for prolonged periods of time after bird removal and environmental cleanup [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prevention-and-prognosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Higher levels of avian antigen in household dust are associated with a poor prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prevention-and-prognosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoids appear to accelerate initial recovery from farmer's lung and bird fancier's lung, particularly in severely ill patients; however, the long-term outcome appears unchanged by glucocorticoid treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prevention-and-prognosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Treatment is usually prescribed for patients with subacute or chronic disease, in particular, those patients with persistent symptoms (eg, dyspnea, cough, fatigue, weight loss), abnormal lung function tests (eg, lung restriction and reduced diffusing capacity), hypoxemia, or radiographic evidence of extensive lung involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prevention-and-prognosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study of 93 patients with farmer's lung compared patients treated with glucocorticoids either for 4 or 12 weeks with a group of control patients treated only with antigen avoidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prevention-and-prognosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Symptom resolution was more rapid among the glucocorticoid-treated groups, but no differences in the course of disease among the three groups were noted after six months. The 12 week glucocorticoid regimen offered no advantage over the four week regimen. Limitations of this report are that the nonglucocorticoid-treated group had less severe disease and the study was not blinded.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A trial of 36 persons with acute farmer's lung randomized patients to eight weeks of treatment with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prevention-and-prognosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. After one month, there was a significant improvement in diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) in the prednisolone-treated group, but no statistically significant differences in force vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), or DLCO were found after that time until follow-up was terminated at five years.</p><p/><p>Based upon observational experience with farmer's lung and bird fancier's lung, glucocorticoids are the standard treatment for severely ill patients with all varieties of HP. Therapy is usually initiated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, 0.5 to 1 mg per kilogram of ideal body weight per day (up to a maximum daily dose of 60 mg per day), given as a single dose each morning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prevention-and-prognosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This dose is maintained for one to two weeks and then tapered over the next two to four weeks. Maintenance doses are not usually required, particularly if the patient has been removed from exposure. Inhaled glucocorticoids may be effective in treating or preventing recurrence, but this approach has not been well studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prevention-and-prognosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>There are, however, problems with the use of systemic glucocorticoids. They cause a variety of side effects, and treatment is not tolerated in all patients (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>). In addition, steroid treatment may lead to an improved sense of well-being which, in some cases, may be counterproductive because less stringent measures to limit future antigen exposure are undertaken [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prevention-and-prognosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6875758\"><span class=\"h2\">Alternative treatments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rituximab</a>, a B cell depleting monoclonal antibody, has been used in individual cases of refractory hypersensitivity pneumonitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prevention-and-prognosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Among six patients with advanced respiratory impairment due to HP that was refractory to glucocorticoid and at least one other immunosuppressive agent, treatment with rituximab was associated with stabilization or improvement in three and progression in three [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prevention-and-prognosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Azathioprine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil have been used in patients with chronic HP who have not responded to <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/antigen&amp;token=Le2c4RlMYbLQVHkeMqrseHwnivznaC+03tIAcwqLkw+aR7jVAnnZI9nJSXgWirI+kYfSaxKeW1RXhgz5F9QynxO95WrVEFj1sadsvZcMxRM=&amp;TOPIC_ID=4311\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">antigen</a> removal and systemic glucocorticoid use. These agents lead to improvements in lung function (DLCO) and appear to have fewer adverse events compared with glucocorticoid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prevention-and-prognosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].

In a case series, 31 patients with HP underwent lung transplantation and were compared with 91 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) transplanted at the same center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prevention-and-prognosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The inciting allergen was identified in 12 patients; eight were exposed to birds, three to mold, and one to wood bark. Among patients with HP, survival at one, three, and five years post transplantation was 96 percent, 89 percent, and 89 percent, respectively, which compared with 86 percent, 67 percent, and 49 percent for patients with IPF. Two patients experienced recurrence of HP in the allograft: one had heavy occupational exposure to trees, possibly sequoias, and lived in a wooded area; the other had heavy exposure to birds and molds with positive serology to avian and fungal precipitins, and posttransplant HP followed a repeat exposure to pigeons. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOME OF HP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of persons with HP experience near total recovery of lung function, which in some cases may take several years after the inciting exposure ceases. Bird fancier's HP appears to have a worse prognosis than farmer's lung. The prognoses of other varieties of HP are less well described. In general, patients with evidence of pulmonary fibrosis on surgical lung biopsy have a poorer prognosis than those without such changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prevention-and-prognosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>].</p><p>Declines in lung function over time is a poor prognostic sign, particularly for patients with chronic HP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prevention-and-prognosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Similar to the GAP model used for predicting mortality in patients with IPF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prevention-and-prognosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], the interstitial lung disease (ILD)-GAP model, which combines age, gender, and measures of pulmonary function (forced vital capacity and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide) with a variable to account for the ILD subtype, can help to predict mortality in chronic HP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prevention-and-prognosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

In particular, a greater severity of traction bronchiectasis and increased extent of honeycombing are associated with increasing mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prevention-and-prognosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/31,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,34</a>].

Approximately 50 percent of farmers develop chronic lung impairment, but the alterations are usually minor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prevention-and-prognosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

As an example, one 14 year study of 89 patients with farmer's lung and 84 controls matched for age, sex, and smoking habits found a higher incidence of airflow obstruction in those with farmer's lung (33 versus 17 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prevention-and-prognosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>In general, PaO<sub>2</sub> improves more rapidly than the forced vital capacity (FVC), while recovery of the diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) takes longest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prevention-and-prognosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of HP can be reduced by diminishing exposure to provocative antigens. This may be accomplished by minimizing contact with potential inciting agents, reducing microbial contamination of the work or home environment, or using protective equipment. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients with HP should be strongly encouraged to completely avoid (preferred) or minimize ongoing exposure. In patients with mild or moderate disease, avoidance may be adequate to resolve the clinical manifestations of the disease. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Antigen avoidance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glucocorticoid treatment with 0.5 to 1 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> per kilogram of ideal body weight per day (up to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> should be considered for severely symptomatic patients, especially if there is physiologic and radiographic evidence of progression of disease. The initial dose is maintained for one to two weeks and is then tapered over the next two to four weeks. Maintenance therapy is rarely required. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of patients with HP experience near total recovery of lung function, which in some cases may take several years after the inciting exposure ceases. Patients with pulmonary fibrosis on surgical lung biopsy have a poorer prognosis than those without such changes. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Outcome of HP'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many farmers with HP are able to continue living and working on their farms after resolution of the initial episode. Long term studies have found mild obstructive airways disease in many farmers after initial HP, although the factors that lead to mild airways disease versus progressive HP are not known. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Farmer's lung'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bird fancier's lung appears to have a worse prognosis than farmer's lung; this may be due to a higher degree of exposure to and persistence of avian antigens in the home environment compared with exposures to antigens that cause farmer's lung. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Bird fancier's lung'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with advanced chronic HP may benefit from lung transplantation, which has been shown to have excellent medium-term survival. Recurrent exposure may lead to HP in the allograft. (See <a href=\"#H1551008363\" class=\"local\">'Lung transplantation'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prevention-and-prognosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Selman M, Pardo A, King TE Jr. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis: insights in diagnosis and pathobiology.
