When DIC happens suddenly, doctors call it &quot;acute DIC.&quot; When DIC happens slowly, doctors call it &quot;chronic DIC.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25859880\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of DIC?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms depend on what condition is causing the DIC and whether the DIC is acute or chronic.</p><p>Acute DIC is often related to a serious illness, such as a bloodstream infection, certain types of cancer, or a rare problem during the second half of pregnancy. People with acute DIC are often very sick. Common symptoms of acute DIC include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding too easily &ndash; People can bleed from cuts in their skin. They can also bleed under the skin or inside the body. Bleeding under the skin can cause large bruises or a rash of red or purple spots that are not painful and do not go away when touched.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Getting blood clots too easily &ndash; Blood clots can form in and damage different organs in the body. Depending on the part of the body involved, symptoms might include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Swelling, redness, or pain in the leg</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Trouble breathing, or chest pain when you take a deep breath</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confusion, trouble thinking clearly, or going into a coma</p><p/><p>People with chronic DIC usually have only mild symptoms, but they can have blood clots.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25859895\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for DIC?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several tests that can help a doctor decide if a person is likely to have DIC. But there is no one test that can tell for sure. To check for DIC, the doctor will look at a person's medical condition and do blood tests that measure clotting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25859910\"><span class=\"h1\">How is DIC treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important treatment for DIC is to treat the condition that led to the DIC.</p><p>After that, treatment depends on a person's symptoms. Most people do not need other treatment.</p><p>People who are bleeding a lot might be treated with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Platelet transfusions &ndash; Platelets are normal blood cells that help blood to clot.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clotting factors &ndash; Clotting factors are natural proteins that help blood to clot.</p><p/><p>People with DIC who get blood clots too easily might be treated with a medicine to prevent blood clots.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25859925\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sepsis-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sepsis in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=adult-respiratory-distress-syndrome-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Adult respiratory distress syndrome (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=delirium-confusion-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Delirium (confusion) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-kidney-injury-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Acute kidney injury (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-in-the-urine-hematuria-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Blood in the urine (hematuria) in adults (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=delirium-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Delirium (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-in-the-urine-hematuria-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Blood in the urine (hematuria) in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
