The majority of ectopic pregnancies occur in the fallopian tube (84 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-methotrexate-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], but other possible sites include cervical, interstitial (also referred to as cornual; a pregnancy located in the proximal segment of the fallopian tube that is embedded within the muscular wall of the uterus), hysterotomy scar (eg, in a women with a previous cesarean delivery), intramural, ovarian, or abdominal. In addition, in rare cases, a multiple gestation may be heterotopic (include both a uterine and extrauterine pregnancy).</p><p>Ectopic pregnancy is a potentially life-threatening condition. While surgical approaches are the mainstay of treatment, many women are candidates for medical therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> because of advances in early diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-methotrexate-therapy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

It inhibits DNA synthesis and cell reproduction, primarily in actively proliferating cells such as malignant cells, trophoblasts, and fetal cells. MTX is rapidly cleared by the kidneys, with 90 percent of an intravenous (IV) dose excreted unchanged within 24 hours of administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-methotrexate-therapy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Treatment of ectopic pregnancy uses an intermediate MTX dose (50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> or 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span>. Low doses (7.5 to 25 mg weekly) are typically used to treat rheumatologic disorders.

Local treatment is highly operator dependent. Also, women bearing the risks of laparoscopic surgery should have definitive treatment (ie, removal of the ectopic gestation via salpingectomy or salpingostomy). Local injection is used in some cases of rare ectopic gestation locations, such as cervical.

The overall rate of resolution of ectopic pregnancy reported in the literature is approximately 90 percent for both single- and multiple-dose protocols [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-methotrexate-therapy/abstract/3,11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,11,13</a>]. Multiple-dose protocols appear to cause more adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-methotrexate-therapy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A single-dose approach is less expensive, requires less intensive monitoring, and does not require <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a> rescue. The following are systematic reviews of the two regimens:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A systematic review of two randomized trials compared single-dose with fixed multiple-dose regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-methotrexate-therapy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. There was no significant difference between treatment success rates, which ranged from 89 to 91 percent for single-dose and from 86 to 93 percent for multi-dose therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-methotrexate-therapy/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. There were no consistent findings regarding rates of complications between the two dose regimens.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another systematic review included 26 observational studies of 1300 women with ectopic pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-methotrexate-therapy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Overall success rates were lower for single- versus multiple-dose regimens, a result that was statistically significant, but may not be clinically significant. This difference was even larger after adjustment for factors such as hCG level and presence of embryonic cardiac activity (odds ratio [OR] 4.74, 95% CI 1.77-12.62). However, significantly fewer side effects were noted after single-dose versus multi-dose treatment (31 versus 41 percent).</p><p/><p>In clinical use, protocols may overlap. Fourteen percent of patients on single-dose regimens ultimately receive two or more doses, and 10 percent of patients on multi-dose regimens receive just a single dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-methotrexate-therapy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>A hybrid of the two protocols, a two-dose MTX regimen (50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> intramuscularly [IM] on Days 0 and 4) has been proposed. A single report on this regimen found an 87 percent treatment success rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-methotrexate-therapy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], infrequent complications and adverse effects, and high patient satisfaction. Further study to evaluate this protocol is needed before it can be recommended.</p><p>We reserve use of multi-dose MTX therapy to interstitial pregnancy or cervical pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Interstitial pregnancy'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-pregnancy#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Medical therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Single-dose protocol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The single-dose protocol is administration of a single IM dose of MTX. Approximately 15 to 20 percent of women will require a second dose of MTX, and patients should be made aware of this before starting the protocol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-methotrexate-therapy/abstract/3,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,17</a>]. Less than 1 percent of patients need more than two doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-methotrexate-therapy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>In the single-dose protocol (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56738\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56738 \">table 1</a>), Day 1 is the day that MTX is administered and an hCG should also be measured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-methotrexate-therapy/abstract/2,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,18</a>]. The dose used is 50 mg per square meter of body surface area (BSA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-methotrexate-therapy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

If the decrease in hCG between Days 4 and 7 is less than 15 percent, a <strong>second</strong> dose of MTX 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> IM is administered. It is common to observe an increase in hCG levels from day 1 through day 4, and this should not cause concern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-methotrexate-therapy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

The pain may be due to tubal abortion or tubal distention from hematoma formation and can usually be controlled with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>.</p><p>A patient with severe pain should be further evaluated with transvaginal ultrasonography. Findings suggestive of hemoperitoneum raise clinical suspicion of tubal rupture. In one study, three parameters predicted hemoperitoneum &ge;300 mL in women with ectopic pregnancy: moderate to severe pelvic pain, fluid above the uterine fundus or around the ovary, and serum hemoglobin concentration &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-methotrexate-therapy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. A woman with none of these three criteria had a probability of 5.3 percent of hemoperitoneum &ge;300 mL. When two or more criteria were present, the probability for hemoperitoneum &ge;300 mL reached 92.6 percent.</p><p>Women with severe pain should be closely observed for hemodynamic changes which may accompany a tubal rupture. Falling hCG levels do not preclude the possibility of tubal rupture. If tubal rupture is suspected, immediate surgery is required.</p><p>Severe pain alone in a hemodynamically stable patient is not an indication for surgery. As an example, a review of 56 women with abdominal pain severe enough to be evaluated in the clinic or emergency department, or requiring hospitalization, found that only eight patients subsequently required surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-methotrexate-therapy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">SUBSEQUENT PREGNANCY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26079278\"><span class=\"h2\">Interval to conception</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There has been no study addressing the earliest time to conceive after MTX treatment of ectopic pregnancy. One study reported that patients with ectopic pregnancies treated with MTX had a timely return of menses and superior rates of conception compared with those treated with conservative surgical management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-methotrexate-therapy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, a retrospective study of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation after MTX treatment of ectopic pregnancy reported decreased number of oocytes in the cycle within 180 days after MTX compared with that in later days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-methotrexate-therapy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>The safe interval from MTX treatment to conception is unclear. Toxicology literature recommends a four- to six-month washout period before attempting to become pregnant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-methotrexate-therapy/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. A retrospective study of women who conceive after MTX treatment for ectopic pregnancy found no difference in fetal malformation and adverse outcome rates in those who conceived within less than six months compared with six or more months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-methotrexate-therapy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Thus, since there is no apparent deleterious effect of previous MTX treatment on the offspring, it is reasonable to allow the patients to conceive. However, residual MTX may be stored in the liver and kidney for months.</p><p>We advise women not to conceive for three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-methotrexate-therapy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. On the other hand, there is no evidence of teratogenic risk to those who conceive sooner. Women trying to conceive should take the folate daily, according to routine preconception recommendations.
