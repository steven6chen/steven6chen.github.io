Symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Forgetting all sorts of things</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble with language (for example, not being able to find the right words for things)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble concentrating and reasoning</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems with tasks such as paying bills or balancing a checkbook</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Getting lost in familiar places</p><p/><p>As dementia gets worse, it can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cause anger or aggression</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make people see things that aren't there or believe things that aren't true</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impair people's ability to eat, bathe, dress, or do other everyday tasks</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cause people to lose bladder and bowel control</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H552500394\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the different kinds of dementia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common kinds include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Alzheimer disease</strong> &ndash; Alzheimer disease is the most common cause of dementia. It is a disorder in which brain cells slowly die over time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vascular dementia</strong> &ndash; Vascular dementia happens when parts of the brain do not get enough blood. This can happen when blood vessels in the brain get clogged with blood clots or fatty deposits. This form of dementia is most common among people who have had strokes or who are at risk for strokes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Parkinson disease dementia</strong> &ndash; Parkinson disease is a brain disorder that affects movement. It causes trembling, stiffness, and slowness. As it gets worse, it can also cause dementia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other causes of dementia</strong> &ndash; Dementia can also happen if a person's brain has been damaged. For example, having many head injuries can lead to dementia.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H552500401\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, you should see a doctor or nurse if you think you or someone close to you is showing signs of dementia. Sometimes memory loss and confusion are caused by medical problems other than dementia that can be treated. For example, people with diabetes sometimes show signs of confusion when their blood sugar is not well controlled.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H552500408\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there tests I should have?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse will decide which tests you should have based on your individual situation. Many people with signs of dementia do not need a brain scan. That's because the tests that are most useful are the ones that look at how you answer questions and do certain tasks. Even so, your doctor might want to do a brain scan (either CT or MRI) to make sure that your symptoms are not caused by a problem unrelated to dementia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H552500415\"><span class=\"h1\">How is dementia treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on what kind of dementia you have. If you have Alzheimer disease, there are medicines that might help some. If you have vascular dementia, your doctor will focus on keeping your blood pressure and cholesterol as close to normal as possible. Doing that can help reduce further damage to the brain.</p><p>Sadly, there really aren't good treatments for most types of dementia. But doctors can sometimes treat troubling symptoms that come with dementia, such as depression or anxiety.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H552500422\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I stay safe?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have dementia, you might not be aware of how much your condition affects you. Trust your family and friends to tell you when it is no longer safe for you to drive, cook, or do other things that could be dangerous.</p><p>Be aware, too, that people with dementia often fall and hurt themselves. To reduce the risk of falls, it's a good idea to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secure loose rugs or use non-skid backing on rugs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tuck away loose wires or electrical cords</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear sturdy, comfortable shoes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep walkways well lit</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H552500429\"><span class=\"h1\">Can dementia be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no proven ways to prevent dementia. But here are some things that seem to help keep the brain healthy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical activity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A healthy diet</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Social interaction</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H552500436\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=parkinson-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Parkinson disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tips-for-caregivers-of-people-with-alzheimer-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Tips for caregivers of people with Alzheimer disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mild-cognitive-impairment-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Mild cognitive impairment (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluating-memory-and-thinking-problems-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Evaluating memory and thinking problems (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=time-to-stop-driving-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Time to stop driving?
