A 2013 systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials for the US Preventive Services Task Force found that appropriate management of gestational diabetes (nutritional therapy, self-blood glucose monitoring, administration of insulin if target blood glucose concentrations are not met with diet alone) resulted in reductions in [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-and-maternal-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preeclampsia (relative risk [RR] 0.62, 95% CI 0.43-0.89; <span class=\"nowrap\">72/1001</span> [7.2 percent] versus <span class=\"nowrap\">119/1013</span> [11.7 percent], three trials)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Birth weight &gt;4000 g (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.35-0.71; five trials)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shoulder dystocia (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.23-0.77; three trials)</p><p/><p>Two trials showed no difference in maternal weight gain while two large trials showed less weight gain with treatment; inconsistency across trials and imprecise effect estimates precluded meta-analysis. </p><p>The only potential harm resulting from treatment of gestational diabetes was an increased number of prenatal visits. No statistically significant changes in rates of cesarean delivery, induction of labor, small for gestational age neonates, neonatal hypoglycemia, neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, neonatal respiratory complications, birth trauma, or neonatal intensive care unit admission were demonstrated compared with no treatment, although the quality of available evidence was low. The frequency and consequences of maternal hypoglycemia in women treated with insulin was not reported.</p><p>Although some authors have suggested that maternal obesity and excessive weight gain during pregnancy may be more closely related to adverse outcomes than glucose intolerance, data from the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) study refute this hypothesis. In the HAPO study, obesity and gestational diabetes (International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups criteria) were independently predictive of fetal macrosomia, preeclampsia, primary cesarean delivery, and neonatal adiposity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-and-maternal-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Macrosomia was more likely when gestational diabetes was present in the absence of obesity (odds ratio [OR] 2.19, 95% CI 1.93-2.47) than when obesity was present in the absence of gestational diabetes (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.50-2.00), and the independent effects of gestational diabetes and obesity were additive. As a practical matter, pharmacologic and surgical interventions are not used for treating obesity in pregnant women, and efforts to limit gestational weight gain have met with limited success; however, gestational diabetes can be identified and treated, and treatment can prevent adverse outcomes as well as decrease gestational weight gain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-and-maternal-prognosis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. </p><p>Another controversy relates to the timing of treatment in gestational diabetes. A secondary analysis of data from a randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-and-maternal-prognosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] found that outcomes of pregnancies with early diagnosis and treatment (all between 24 and 30+6 weeks of gestation) of mild gestational diabetes (fasting value &lt;95 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> and two elevated postchallenge values) were not significantly different based on when gestational diabetes was identified and treatment was initiated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-and-maternal-prognosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Pregnancy outcomes were similar when treatment was initiated at 24 to 26, 27, 28, or 29 weeks compared with &ge;30 weeks of gestation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">NUTRITIONAL THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with gestational diabetes should receive nutritional counseling by a registered dietitian (when possible) upon diagnosis and be placed on an appropriate diet. The goals of medical nutritional therapy are to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Achieve normoglycemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevent ketosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provide adequate weight gain based on maternal body mass index (BMI)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contribute to fetal well-being</p><p/><p>Most women with gestational diabetes (70 to 85 percent) can achieve normoglycemia with nutritional therapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-and-maternal-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A detailed review of medical nutritional treatment of individuals with diabetes can be found separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutritional-considerations-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutritional considerations in type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>). Noncaloric sweeteners, such as aspartame, sucralose, and others, may be used in moderation.</p><p>There is scant high-quality evidence to support most aspects of the nutritional prescription for gestational diabetes; a 2013 systematic review identified only nine small trials that compared a total of six different dietary approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-and-maternal-prognosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends that nutrition therapy for gestational diabetes mellitus provide adequate nutrition to promote fetal and maternal well-being while achieving normoglycemia with absence of ketosis and providing adequate energy levels for appropriate weight gain in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-and-maternal-prognosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The food plan should be based on a nutrition assessment with guidance from the Dietary Reference Intakes for all pregnant women (minimum of 175 grams of carbohydrate, 71 grams of protein, and 28 grams of fiber) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-and-maternal-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In clinical practice, women often require 1800 to 2500 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/day</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36548474\"><span class=\"h2\">Meal plan</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A typical meal plan for women with gestational diabetes mellitus includes three small- to moderate-sized meals and two to four snacks. Adjustment of the meal plan should be ongoing and based upon results of self-glucose monitoring, appetite, and weight-gain patterns. Close follow-up is important to ensure nutritional adequacy. Individual assessment and self-blood glucose monitoring are used to determine and modify specific <span class=\"nowrap\">nutrition/food</span> recommendations. If insulin therapy is added to nutrition therapy, a primary goal is to maintain carbohydrate consistency at meals and snacks to facilitate insulin adjustments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2240288023\"><span class=\"h3\">Calories</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women who are at ideal body weight during pregnancy, the caloric requirement is 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg/day;</span> for women who are overweight, the caloric requirement is 22 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg/day;</span> and for morbidly obese women, the caloric requirement is 12 to 14 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg/day</span> (present pregnant weight), but obese women should consume a minimum of 1800 <span class=\"nowrap\">cal/day</span> to prevent ketosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-and-maternal-prognosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. For women who are underweight, the caloric requirement may be up to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg/day</span> to achieve recommended weight gains, blood glucose goals, and nutrient intake. </p><p>No increase in calories is recommended for the first trimester, an additional 340 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/day</span> above prepregnancy levels is recommended during the second trimester, and an additional 452 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/day</span> above prepregnancy levels is recommended during the third trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-and-maternal-prognosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. There are no strong data to support these standard recommendations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1663664966\"><span class=\"h3\">Carbohydrate intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the caloric needs are calculated, carbohydrate intake needs to be determined as it is the primary nutrient affecting postprandial glucose levels. The total amount of carbohydrate, the distribution of carbohydrate over meals and snacks, and the type of carbohydrate can be manipulated to blunt postprandial hyperglycemia. </p><p>There is sparse evidence from randomized trials as to the ideal carbohydrate intake for treatment of gestational diabetes. We limit carbohydrate intake to 40 percent of total calories, while ensuring that ketonuria does not ensue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-and-maternal-prognosis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. A 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials of dietary intervention in gestational diabetes or pregnancy with hyperglycemia found low carbohydrate diets did not change either maternal or newborn outcomes, but the data were insufficient to detect small or moderate statistical differences in obstetric outcomes between the patient groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-and-maternal-prognosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>Many women will need individual adjustment (ie, 15 to 30 g of carbohydrate at breakfast or other meals), depending on postprandial glucose levels, which are directly dependent upon the carbohydrate content of the meal or snack [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-and-maternal-prognosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The postprandial glucose rise, therefore, can be blunted if the diet is carbohydrate restricted. In addition, an overall low glycemic index diet in which carbohydrate sources are mainly comprised of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, with low consumption of flour-based products (eg, bread and other baked products) and potatoes had a favorable effect on postprandial blood glucose concentrations and significantly lowered the need for insulin therapy in the meta-analysis described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-and-maternal-prognosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]; however, a clear effect on pregnancy outcome, particularly macrosomia, cesarean delivery, and maternal weight gain, has not been proven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-and-maternal-prognosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dietary-carbohydrates#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dietary carbohydrates&quot;, section on 'Glycemic index'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutritional-considerations-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutritional considerations in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Glycemic index and glycemic load'</a>). Probiotics and high fiber diets do not appear to improve glycemic control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-and-maternal-prognosis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3686230906\"><span class=\"h3\">Protein and fat intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The remaining calories come from protein (20 percent of total calories) and fats (40 percent of total calories; saturated fat intake should be &lt;7 percent of total calories). Protein intake should be distributed throughout the day, and included in all meals and snacks to promote satiety and provide adequate calories. A bedtime snack may be needed to prevent accelerated (starvation) ketosis overnight. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3033589834\"><span class=\"h2\">Gestational weight gain/loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After prescribing the diet, it is important to pay attention to subsequent changes in weight. A retrospective cohort study including 31,074 women with gestational diabetes mellitus showed that those with appropriate weight gain (per Institute of Medicine 2000 recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-and-maternal-prognosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]) had optimal outcomes, while excessive weight gain was associated with a significantly increased risk of having a large for gestational age infant, preterm birth, and cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-and-maternal-prognosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Suboptimal weight gain increased the likelihood of avoiding medical therapy of gestational diabetes and decreased the likelihood of having a large for gestational age neonate; however, there were more small for gestational age neonates in this group (7.3 versus 5.6 percent). The data in this study were not corrected for potential confounders, such as smoking. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-pregnancy-complications-and-maternal-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in pregnancy: Complications and maternal management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=weight-gain-and-loss-in-pregnancy#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Weight gain and loss in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Recommendations for weight gain during pregnancy'</a>.)</p><p>Some women experience a minimal amount (1 to 5 pounds) of weight loss or weight stabilization for the first few weeks after starting nutritional therapy. This should be evaluated in the overall context of weight gain in pregnancy and ongoing surveillance of weight gain in the weeks thereafter. </p><p>Weight loss in pregnancy is not generally recommended, although controversy exists regarding this recommendation for markedly obese women. Maternal obesity often worsens impaired glucose tolerance. Furthermore, maternal gestational diabetes and obesity are independently associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as excessive fetal growth and preeclampsia, and their combination has a greater impact than either disorder alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-and-maternal-prognosis/abstract/2,19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,19-21</a>].</p><p>For obese women (BMI &gt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>),</span> a modest energy restriction to reduce weight gain can be achieved by restricting caloric intake by approximately 30 percent below the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) for pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-and-maternal-prognosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This can be achieved while meeting Institute of Medicine (IOM) weight gain recommendations and without causing ketosis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=weight-gain-and-loss-in-pregnancy#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Weight gain and loss in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Recommendations for weight gain during pregnancy'</a>). In the 2014 meta-analysis described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-and-maternal-prognosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], energy restriction did not significantly reduce the cesarean delivery rate, frequency of macrosomia, or rate of neonatal hypoglycemia, but data were limited to two small trials and were inconsistent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Nutritional therapy to decrease the risk of macrosomia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gestational diabetes mellitus has major fetal effects on birth weight and body composition: infants of diabetic mothers are at high risk of being large for gestational age. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infant-of-a-diabetic-mother\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infant of a diabetic mother&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Macrosomia may not be prevented by dietary therapy alone. A Cochrane review of four studies involving 612 women with gestational diabetes treated with primary dietary therapy or no specific treatment found no differences in birth weight greater than 4000 g (odds ratio [OR] 0.78, 95% CI 0.45-1.35) or cesarean deliveries (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.65-1.44) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-and-maternal-prognosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, the variable quality of these studies and wide confidence intervals precluded a definitive conclusion about the value of dietary intervention. As an example, the investigators did not consistently assess dietary compliance or postprandial glucose concentration in women in whom a diet was prescribed. In the two randomized trials in which diagnosis and treatment of mild gestational diabetes improved outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-and-maternal-prognosis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>], only 20 and 8 percent of women, respectively, required insulin, while 80 and 92 percent of women, respectively, were treated satisfactorily with diet.</p><p>Some experts have suggested medical nutritional therapy for women who do not meet oral glucose tolerance test (GTT) criteria for gestational diabetes but have fasting blood glucose concentrations &gt;90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-and-maternal-prognosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], an abnormal glucose challenge test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-and-maternal-prognosis/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>], or one abnormal value on the three-hour 100 g oral GTT (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetes mellitus in pregnancy: Screening and diagnosis&quot;</a>). The rationale for this approach is that there appears to be a continuous relationship between glucose concentration and fetal <span class=\"nowrap\">growth/adverse</span> fetal outcome, even in women who did not meet the former ADA criteria for diagnosis of diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-and-maternal-prognosis/abstract/23-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-29</a>]. This was best illustrated in the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) study, which included more than 23,000 pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-and-maternal-prognosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. After a two-hour 75 g oral GTT, the risk of macrosomia increased as much as fivefold as fasting plasma glucose concentration increased above 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (4.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> or one-hour glucose concentration increased above 105 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (5.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> or two-hour glucose concentration increased above 90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (5.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> and the risk increased continuously across the spectrum of glucose results. There was also a positive, but weaker, correlation between increasing glucose concentration and maternal complications (eg, preeclampsia) and neonatal metabolic morbidity (eg, hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia), but not intermediate-term childhood morbidity, such as obesity at age two years in a small subset of offspring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-and-maternal-prognosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], although, as noted above, previous longitudinal studies have suggested that obesity does not manifest itself in offspring of diabetic mothers until the age of 6 to 7 years. Of note, women with significant hyperglycemia were excluded from the HAPO analysis (exclusion criteria: fasting glucose concentration greater than 105 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [5.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L],</span> two-hour glucose concentration greater than 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [11.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L],</span> or a random glucose concentration later in gestation greater than 160 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [8.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span>.</p><p>In a 2012 systematic review of four randomized trials (n = 543 women) of women with one or more elevated glucose levels on a three-hour 100 g oral GTT who did not meet standard criteria for gestational diabetes mellitus, glucose monitoring, and medical nutritional therapy (with or without insulin) resulted in a reduction in delivery of large for gestational age infants compared with usual care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-and-maternal-prognosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Similarly, in the Australian Carbohydrate Intolerance in Pregnant Women trial, medical nutritional therapy (with or without insulin) initiated at two-hour 75 g GTT levels of 140 to 198 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (7.8 to 11.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L;</span> ie, a range between a normal and a diabetic response on oral GTT) resulted in a lower rate of serious perinatal complications compared with routine care (1 versus 4 percent; adjusted risk ratio [RR] 0.33; 95% CI 0.14-0.75) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-and-maternal-prognosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3209903096\"><span class=\"h2\">Supplements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myoinositol supplementation during pregnancy has been studied both as a potential treatment for gestational diabetes mellitusand for prevention of gestational diabetes mellitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-and-maternal-prognosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

When initially diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus, we ask patients to measure their blood glucose concentration at least four times daily (fasting and one or two hours after the first bite of each meal) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-and-maternal-prognosis/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. Multiple daily measurements allow recognition of women who should begin an antihyperglycemic agent. Results should be recorded in a glucose log, along with dietary information. This facilitates recognition of glycemic patterns and helps immeasurably in interpreting results stored in the memory of modern meters. Results from most available glucose meters and commercial laboratories reflect plasma (not whole blood) glucose levels. However, meters cannot correct for the fact that postprandial glucose concentrations tend to be higher in capillary samples because of <span class=\"nowrap\">arterial/venous</span> mixing.

In a randomized trial in women with well-controlled gestational diabetes on nutritional therapy after one week of four times daily blood glucose testing, testing blood glucose every other day versus four times daily resulted in similar birth weights and frequency of macrosomia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-and-maternal-prognosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

The rate of small for gestational age (SGA) infants trended higher in the continuously monitored group (6 versus 3 percent). These results suggest that increasing the intensity of glucose monitoring and insulin therapy may further improve pregnancy outcomes in gestational diabetes mellitus; however, the benefits and risks of this approach require more study in other populations, especially given the resources that would be required to institute it for the large proportion of gravidas with gestational diabetes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucose target</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The glucose level at which the disadvantages of initiating insulin therapy are clearly outweighed by the benefits has not been definitively determined; there is little consensus in the literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-and-maternal-prognosis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

Typically, regardless of body weight, insulin dosing is based on the glucose levels recorded in the patient&rsquo;s blood glucose log. For example, if glucose elevations are mostly postprandial, then a starting dose of 10 to 20 units of intermediate-acting insulin and 6 to 10 units of rapid-acting insulin are prescribed in the morning before breakfast, based on the degree of elevations. However, if diabetes is diagnosed and therapy instituted early in pregnancy (prior to third trimester screening), we generally use slightly lower doses since insulin resistance has not reached its maximum level in the first and second trimesters. </p><p>The 2:1 proportion of intermediate to rapid-acting insulin is based on the pattern of insulin release in normal pregnant women in the third trimester []. If the postdinner glucose level is elevated, then an additional injection of rapid-acting insulin is given just prior to dinner. If fasting glucose is elevated, intermediate-acting insulin can be given separately at bedtime, preferably but also along with dinner on an individualized basis. </p><p>Sometimes an additional dose of rapid-acting insulin is necessary to maintain euglycemia after lunch, so that a total of four injections per day are needed. A four-times-per-day regimen improved glycemic control and perinatal outcome compared with a twice-daily regimen in one randomized trial [], although macrosomia rates were not impacted. </p><p>Subsequent adjustments in the various components of the insulin regimen are made based upon glucose levels recorded from self-blood glucose monitoring. </p><p>Because any insulin regimen requires serial dosing adjustments in response to specific fasting or postprandial glucose levels, the starting dose should be considered just that, a starting point. Adjustments in insulin dosage in response to high glucose values are typically in the range of 10 to 20 percent, particularly in obese patients with gestational diabetes mellitus who are unlikely to develop hypoglycemia unless a meal is omitted after insulin is given.</p><p>The titration of insulin dose to blood glucose levels is based upon frequent self-monitoring. Four to six glucose measurements each day are needed to optimize therapy (fasting and one or two hours postprandial with the possible addition of prelunch and predinner) and ensure a smooth increase of insulin as insulin requirements increase with pregnancy progression. Twin gestations complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus may require an approximate doubling of the insulin requirement throughout pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3874478336\"><span class=\"h4\">Insulin adjustments when specific glucose levels are not well controlled</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An alternative approach to insulin therapy, somewhat more complex and likely most appropriate for individuals whose glucose levels are not well controlled with simpler paradigms, is described below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If insulin is required because the fasting blood glucose concentration is high, an intermediate-acting insulin, such as NPH insulin, is given before bedtime; an initial dose of 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/kg</span> body weight is utilized.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If postprandial blood glucose concentrations are high, rapid-acting insulin analogs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-aspart-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">insulin aspart</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-lispro-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">insulin lispro</a> are given before meals at a dose calculated to be 1.5 units per 10 g carbohydrate in the breakfast meal and 1 unit per 10 g carbohydrate in the lunch and dinner meals.

The administration of a pure simple sugar in a pregnant woman with diabetes may lead to rapid elevation of glucose followed by rapid decline.
