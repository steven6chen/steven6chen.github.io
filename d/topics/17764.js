These lesions are often accompanied by erosions or bullae involving the oral, genital, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ocular mucosae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F68640%7EDERM%2F79955%7EDERM%2F62370%7EDERM%2F65570%7EDERM%2F58969%7EDERM%2F75314\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68640 graphicRef79955 graphicRef62370 graphicRef65570 graphicRef58969 graphicRef75314 \">picture 1A-F</a>). Erythema multiforme major is the term used to describe EM with mucosal involvement; erythema multiforme minor refers to EM without mucosal disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-erythema-multiforme#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of erythema multiforme&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>A variety of factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of EM. The disorder is most commonly induced by infection, with herpes simplex virus (HSV) being the most frequent precipitator. The clinical course of EM is usually self-limited, resolving within weeks without significant sequelae. However, in a minority of cases, the disease recurs frequently over the course of years.</p><p>Similarities in clinical and histopathologic findings have led to controversy over the distinction between EM and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), an often drug-induced disorder that may present with cutaneous targetoid lesions and mucosal erosions. However, there is suggestive evidence that EM with mucous membrane involvement and SJS are different diseases with distinct causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-erythema-multiforme/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The term erythema multiforme major should <strong>not</strong> be used to refer to SJS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stevens-johnson-syndrome-and-toxic-epidermal-necrolysis-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The treatment and prognosis of acute and recurrent EM will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis of this disorder are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-erythema-multiforme\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of erythema multiforme&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF ACUTE EM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of acute erythema multiforme (EM) varies according to disease severity. The clinical course of an episode of EM is self-limited, although the disease may recur. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of recurrent EM'</a> below.)</p><p>Interventions targeted toward reducing pain or pruritus are sufficient for patients with mild disease. In contrast, systemic glucocorticoid therapy should be considered for patients with severe oral mucosal involvement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Inciting agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 90 percent of cases of EM are triggered by infections, but there are few data on the effect of acute treatment of the inciting infection on the severity or duration of EM. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-erythema-multiforme#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of erythema multiforme&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p>Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-induced EM occurs an average of eight days after the development of HSV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-erythema-multiforme/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], at a time when treatment solely for HSV infection is no longer indicated. The results of two case series suggest that treatment with oral antivirals after the appearance of HSV-associated EM does <strong>not</strong> affect the clinical course of the eruption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-erythema-multiforme/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>There are no formal studies of the effect of treatment of other infectious causes of EM, such as <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em>, on the duration or severity of mucocutaneous lesions. In general, treatment should be instituted as appropriate for management of an active infection. If EM is thought to be due to a new drug, the drug should be discontinued.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Mild disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with only cutaneous involvement or limited oral mucosal involvement that is not disabling, management is focused on symptomatic relief. Topical corticosteroids (medium potency, low potency for facial or intertriginous areas) and oral antihistamines can be used in patients who note itching and burning of cutaneous lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Painful oral erosions can be treated with a high potency topical corticosteroid gel and mouthwashes that contain a mixture of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a>, and antacids. We typically use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluocinonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluocinonide</a> 0.05% gel applied two to three times per day, and a mouthwash containing equal parts of viscous lidocaine 2%, diphenhydramine (12.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/5</span> mL), and an <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aluminum-hydroxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aluminum hydroxide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-hydroxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium hydroxide</a> mixture (Maalox) as a swish-and-spit as needed, up to four times per day.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Severe oral mucosal involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extensive oral mucosal involvement may result in severe pain, leading to an inability to ingest foods or liquids. Systemic glucocorticoids are often used in an attempt to decrease the severity of symptoms and to shorten the course of the disease. However, no high-quality studies on the efficacy of this approach have been performed in EM.</p><p>Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (40 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> initially and subsequently tapered over two to three weeks) was the only effective treatment in one series of 11 patients with recurrent oral EM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-erythema-multiforme/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, some authors have expressed concern that glucocorticoids only partially suppress disease activity and may increase the risk for disease chronicity and prolonged duration of attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-erythema-multiforme/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>We suggest short courses of oral glucocorticoids <strong>only</strong> in patients with severe and debilitating EM with mucosal involvement. The usual starting dose is 40 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> or its equivalent tapered over two to four weeks. Patients manifesting severe mucous membrane involvement that prevents sufficient oral intake may require hospitalization for nutrition and pain control.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Ocular involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with ocular involvement should be referred immediately to an ophthalmologist for assessment and treatment to prevent long-term sequelae. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-erythema-multiforme#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of erythema multiforme&quot;, section on 'Course'</a>.)</p><p>Therapy usually involves the use of topical ophthalmic preparations. Topical corticosteroid drops (such as nonpreserved <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> 0.1%) are recommended for treatment of ocular Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-erythema-multiforme/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] and therefore can be considered, under the guidance of an ophthalmologist, for the treatment of ocular EM. Similar to ocular SJS, frequent use of a lubricant (such as nonpreserved hyaluronate or carmellose eye drops) is also important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-erythema-multiforme/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION OF RECURRENT EM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When feasible, as in drug-induced erythema multiforme (EM), the inciting cause of recurrent EM should be eliminated. However, this is not possible in most cases of recurrent EM (eg, herpes simplex virus [HSV]-associated EM or idiopathic EM). Patients who experience six or more recurrences per year or who have fewer, but debilitating episodes of EM are candidates for systemic prophylactic therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-erythema-multiforme#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of erythema multiforme&quot;, section on 'Recurrent erythema multiforme'</a>.)</p><p>Systemic antiviral medication is the first-line treatment for HSV-induced recurrent EM and recurrent EM without an identifiable cause. Immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapies are used for patients who do not improve with antiviral drugs.</p><p>Two studies of patients with recurrent EM seen in tertiary care centers found average rates of recurrence of six episodes per year, with mean durations of disease ranging from 6 to 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-erythema-multiforme/abstract/2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8</a>]. Thus, therapy to prevent recurrent disease may be necessary for a prolonged period.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Antiviral therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three approaches to antiviral prophylaxis have been evaluated in patients with recurrent EM: continuous antiviral therapy, which is the preferred approach; intermittent antiviral prophylaxis; and topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Continuous antiviral therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Continuous antiviral therapy often is effective for the prevention of recurrent HSV-associated EM. The efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> (400 mg twice daily) was investigated in a six-month, randomized trial of 20 patients, the majority of whom were known to have HSV-induced disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-erythema-multiforme/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Patients treated with acyclovir therapy were less likely to have recurrent attacks than patients given placebo (36 versus 100 percent), and the median number of attacks per patient was significantly lower (zero versus three).</p><p>Published case series have supported these results, reporting complete or partial responses to continuous antiviral therapy in over 90 percent of patients with known HSV-associated EM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-erythema-multiforme/abstract/2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8</a>]. In one of these studies, remission of EM was maintained in only 4 of 15 patients following discontinuation of a six-month course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-erythema-multiforme/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>In general, antiviral therapy is much less effective in EM that is not clearly associated with HSV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-erythema-multiforme/abstract/2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8</a>]. The presence of subclinical HSV infection may account for patients who respond to antiviral therapy, but have no history of cutaneous signs of HSV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-erythema-multiforme/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Given the tolerability of systemic antiviral drugs and the possibility of subclinical HSV infection as a cause for EM, we suggest a six-month trial of antiviral suppressive therapy in all patients with idiopathic recurrent EM.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18730881\"><span class=\"h4\">Choice of antiviral agent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is some evidence that the response to therapy may vary among antiviral drugs. The results of one series in which patients with both HSV-associated and idiopathic EM were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valacyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valacyclovir</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=famciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">famciclovir</a> suggested that valacyclovir may be more likely to induce complete responses than the other two drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-erythema-multiforme/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In addition, a case report described valacyclovir-induced remission of EM after failure of acyclovir therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-erythema-multiforme/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In contrast, a case series of three patients with recurrent herpes-associated EM who had failed numerous therapies, including valacyclovir, described complete response to famciclovir (500 mg one to three times daily) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-erythema-multiforme/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The low cost of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> makes it the preferred drug for some patients, and the data above are not sufficient to determine superiority of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valacyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valacyclovir</a> over acyclovir and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=famciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">famciclovir</a>. We typically use any of these three agents for the initial treatment of recurrent EM. We suggest a six-month trial of one of the following regimens:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acyclovir</a> &ndash; 400 mg twice daily</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=valacyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Valacyclovir</a> &ndash; 500 mg twice daily</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=famciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Famciclovir</a> &ndash; 500 mg twice daily</p><p/><p>In our experience, higher doses are necessary for the treatment of some patients. For patients who do not respond to initial treatment with an antiviral agent, we double the above doses. If this is not effective, a trial of an alternative antiviral should be considered.</p><p>There are not sufficient data to support specific recommendations for the duration of treatment in patients with recurrent EM who respond to continuous antiviral therapy. We typically treat for one to two years prior to attempting to discontinue therapy. If EM recurs after treatment is stopped, we restart the antiviral drug at the lowest effective dose and reattempt cessation of therapy every 6 to 12 months thereafter.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Intermittent antiviral therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A short course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> therapy given at the initial sign of recurrent HSV infection decreased the incidence of recurrent EM in a series of 35 patients with EM that was clearly associated with HSV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-erythema-multiforme/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, this regimen does not appear to be as effective as continuous antiviral therapy, which is the preferred approach.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Topical acyclovir</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data are limited on the efficacy of topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a>. In a randomized cross-over trial of 18 patients, daily application of topical 5% acyclovir cream to areas of recurrent HSV infection was not effective for the prevention of HSV-associated recurrent EM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-erythema-multiforme/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Second-line systemic therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who have recurrent EM despite a course of continuous antiviral therapy, other systemic agents should be considered.</p><p>We suggest treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> (100 to 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> or 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> in patients with normal thiopurine methyltransferase activity), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil (1000 to 1500 mg twice daily), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> (100 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> although data on efficacy are limited.</p><p>Based upon our experience, treatment should be continued for at least six months before concluding that a drug is ineffective. For patients who achieve remission, we continue therapy for 6 to 12 months followed by a taper of the medication (over two to four months) to the lowest effective dose or to cessation. If EM recurs, we restart the drug at the lowest effective dose for four to six months prior to another attempt at tapering.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Azathioprine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Successful treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> has been reported in case reports and small series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-erythema-multiforme/abstract/2,5,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,12,13</a>]. In one report, azathioprine (100 to 150 mg daily) was associated with complete disease suppression in 11 patients with severe recurrent EM who failed all other therapies, although the condition recurred upon discontinuing therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-erythema-multiforme/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Azathioprine was less effective in another series, as only two out of five patients achieved complete or partial response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-erythema-multiforme/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Myelosuppression is a serious adverse effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> that may occur more frequently in patients with low activity of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT), an enzyme involved in the metabolism of this drug.

The treatment of acute EM varies according to the severity of the acute eruption and the presence or absence of recurrent disease. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many cases of EM occur secondary to herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. In patients with HSV-induced EM, treatment with oral antivirals in the acute setting does not alter the course of EM, and is not indicated. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Inciting agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with EM can be managed with symptomatic therapy alone. For patients with cutaneous disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mild oral mucosal involvement, treatment with topical corticosteroids, oral antihistamines, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an anesthetic mouthwash is sufficient. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Mild disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe oral mucosal involvement may be accompanied by intense pain and an inability to eat or drink. For patients with severe oral mucosal involvement, we suggest treatment with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (40 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> tapered over the course of two to four weeks (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Patients with disabling symptoms may require hospitalization for nutrition and pain control. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Severe oral mucosal involvement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ocular involvement rarely may lead to keratitis, conjunctival scarring, or visual impairment. Patients with ocular symptoms should be referred to an ophthalmologist. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-erythema-multiforme#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of erythema multiforme&quot;, section on 'Course'</a> and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Ocular involvement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients with EM develop recurrent disease. When feasible, the inciting agent should be identified and eliminated. For patients with HSV-induced or idiopathic EM that recurs &ge;6 times per year, or who have fewer, but disabling episodes, we recommend treatment with continuous antiviral therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Continuous antiviral therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with severe, recurrent EM who fail to respond to continuous systemic antiviral therapy, we suggest treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Other options for therapy include other immunomodulatory drugs.
