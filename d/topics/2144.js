The preoccupation with perceived flaws leads to repetitive behaviors (eg, checking their appearance in mirrors), which are difficult to control and are not pleasurable. BDD is common but usually under-recognized, causes distress <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> impaired functioning, and is often associated with suicidal ideation and behavior. </p><p>Patients with BDD may present to mental health professionals as well as other clinicians, such as dermatologists, plastic surgeons, primary care physicians, pediatricians, and dentists. Most patients seek nonpsychiatric treatment (most commonly dermatologic and surgical) for their perceived physical defects; this treatment appears to be ineffective for most patients and can be risky for clinicians to provide. By contrast, pharmacotherapy (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomipramine</a>) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cognitive-behavioral therapy tailored specifically to BDD are often efficacious. </p><p>This topic reviews the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations of BDD. The assessment, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of BDD are discussed separately.

The etiology may involve biologic, psychological, and social factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Studies of the pathogenesis often use a cross-sectional design, making it unclear whether abnormalities (eg, neuroimaging findings) represent etiologic causes, sequelae, neither, or both. In addition, the studies are usually small. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Genetics</strong> &ndash; A study of monozygotic and dizygotic female twin pairs (total n &gt;3500) found that excessive preoccupations with a perceived or slight flaw in physical appearance (&ldquo;dysmorphic concern,&rdquo; not necessarily the diagnosis BDD) was a heritable trait, such that 44 percent of the variance in dysmorphic concern was due to genetic factors and 56 percent to nonshared (unique) environmental factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In addition, the association between dysmorphic concern and obsessive-compulsive symptoms appeared to be primarily due to shared genetic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. One candidate gene study detected an association between BDD and the GABA-A-gamma-2 (5q31.1-q33.2) receptor gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neuroimaging</strong> &ndash; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to compare brain activity and structure in BDD patients with that in healthy controls, but the literature is regarded as preliminary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Functional MRI studies suggest that BDD is associated with abnormal visual processing, with a bias for encoding and analyzing details of faces, as well as nonfacial objects, rather than using holistic visual processing strategies (ie, seeing &ldquo;the big picture&rdquo;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. As an example, one study compared patients with BDD with healthy controls and found that patients had abnormal activation patterns, including hyperactivity in the left orbitofrontal cortex and bilateral head of the caudate as well as hypoactivity in the occipital cortex (a visual processing area) when viewing certain faces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The orbitofrontal and caudate findings overlap with those observed in patients with obsessive compulsive disorder. Other studies suggest that visual information processing in BDD and in anorexia nervosa may have some similarities in that both groups appear to manifest a pattern of over-attention to detail and reduced processing of global features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. &#160; &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Two structural MRI studies indicated that total white matter volume was larger in patients with BDD compared with control subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>], but other studies failed to replicate this finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Studies of white matter integrity in patients and controls have also yielded inconsistent results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. One study of neural networks found that white matter network organization was abnormal in BDD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neglect and abuse</strong> &ndash; Studies indicate that compared with published norms, patients with BDD report lower than average levels of perceived parental care during childhood, greater teasing by peers, and more maltreatment (neglect and abuse) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features/abstract/11,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,26</a>]. As an example, one study found that a history of emotional, physical, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sexual abuse was reported by more patients with BDD (n = 50) than patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (n = 50) (38 versus 14 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], and another study found that self-reports of early life traumatic events were greater in patients with BDD than healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, the accuracy of childhood maltreatment in the studies was not confirmed. </p><p/><p>The pathogenesis of BDD may also involve neurocognitive dysfunction, which is discussed elsewhere in this topic.

BDD causes distress <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> impaired functioning, and is often associated with suicidal ideation and behavior.</p><p>In addition, BDD is often a severe illness. A study of inpatients with BDD (n = 16) and without BDD (n = 106) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], and a study of outpatients with (n = 16) and without BDD (n = 484) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], both found that clinical severity and functional impairment were greater in patients with BDD than patients without BDD.</p><p>Patients with BDD typically do not reveal their symptoms unless specifically asked [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features/abstract/4,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,7</a>]; patients are often embarrassed and ashamed, afraid of being misunderstood and negatively judged, and many are unaware that effective treatment is available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H62823964\"><span class=\"h2\">Appearance preoccupations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with BDD are preoccupied with nonexistent or slight defects in the physical appearance of one or more body parts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features/abstract/9,11,29,30,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11,29,30,32</a>]. The appearance preoccupations are difficult to resist or control, and occur for an average of three to eight hours a day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features/abstract/9,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,33</a>]. The body areas are perceived as unattractive, repulsive, abnormal, or deformed, and some patients describe themselves as looking like a freak, a monster, a burn victim, or the &ldquo;Elephant Man.&rdquo; The preoccupations with appearance are distressing in part because they focus on perceived unacceptability of the self to others, and in many cases, involve a belief that other people mock and reject the person because of how they look. (See <a href=\"#H62823985\" class=\"local\">'Social avoidance'</a> below.)</p><p>Most patients over the course of illness are preoccupied with the appearance of multiple body areas (average of five to seven different areas) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features/abstract/9,11,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11,32</a>]. However, some patients are excessively preoccupied with just one body area, whereas others dislike virtually every aspect of their appearance. The most commonly disliked body parts are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features/abstract/1,3,32,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,32,34</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin (eg, acne, scarring, blemishes, color, or wrinkles)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hair (eg, balding or too much body hair)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nose (eg, size or shape)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stomach</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Hips/buttocks</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breasts </p><p/><p>However, any area of the body can be the focus of concern. In addition, symmetry concerns are common (eg, uneven nostrils, eyes at a different level, or uneven sideburns). </p><p>Among patients with BDD, females are more likely than males to be preoccupied with their weight, hips, breasts, legs, and excessive facial or body hair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Males are more likely than females to be preoccupied with thinning hair and to have muscle dysmorphia. (See <a href=\"#H62823992\" class=\"local\">'Muscle dysmorphia'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H62823978\"><span class=\"h2\">Compulsions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A core aspect of BDD is compulsions, which are repetitive behaviors or mental acts that are driven by appearance preoccupations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features/abstract/9,11,32,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11,32,34</a>]. The belief that one looks unacceptable causes emotional distress (eg, anxiety, depressed mood, and shame). These negative feelings in turn fuel compulsive behaviors that are intended to fix, hide, inspect, or obtain reassurance about the disliked body parts. These time-consuming behaviors are usually difficult to control and are not pleasurable. Most compulsions are motoric and observable by others, but mental rituals (eg, comparing) can occur as well. These behaviors often increase rather than decrease anxiety and distress induced by the appearance concerns. </p><p>All individuals with BDD perform repetitive behaviors at some point during the course of their illness. These behaviors may be clues that a person has BDD; patients who present with these behaviors should be assessed for BDD. The following compulsive behaviors are most common; all percentages are for lifetime (past and present) occurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features/abstract/11,32,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,32,35</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Camouflaging</strong> &ndash; About 90 percent of patients try to hide or cover up the disliked body areas. Camouflaging can include using a hat, heavy make-up, clothing, hair, sunglasses, or one&rsquo;s hands. About one-quarter of BDD patients excessively tan to darken &ldquo;pale&rdquo; skin, minimize perceived acne or wrinkles, camouflage areas such as a &ldquo;bald spot&rdquo; on the head, or diminish other BDD concerns. Many patients camouflage by positioning their body to make the disliked areas less visible to others. Camouflaging often involves repetitive, compulsive behavior, such as repeatedly applying makeup or frequently adjusting one&rsquo;s clothing or body position. However, camouflaging is also avoidant in nature (ie, a safety behavior), in the sense that the goal is to avoid feeling the shame that occurs when the &ldquo;flawed&rdquo; body areas are seen by others.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Comparing &ndash; </strong>Nearly 90 percent of patients frequently compare their disliked features with those of other people in their surroundings, as well as people in newspapers, magazines, online, or on television. This behavior can preoccupy patients so much that they have difficulty focusing upon conversations or tasks. In addition, comparing often increases distress because patients with BDD tend not only to underestimate their own attractiveness but also overestimate the attractiveness of others. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mirror checking</strong> <strong>&ndash; </strong>Nearly 90 percent of patients compulsively check their perceived defects in mirrors and other reflecting surfaces (eg, windows, backs of spoons, and shiny appliances), often doing this for hours each day. While mirror checking, patients may perform other behaviors, such as excessive grooming or skin picking. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Excessive grooming &ndash; </strong>More than half of patients excessively groom; patients may repeatedly style or comb their hair, repeatedly apply make-up, or pull or pluck their hair (eg, to remove &ldquo;excessive&rdquo; facial hair or to &ldquo;even up&rdquo; eyebrows or sideburns). However, hair pulling may be due to trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) rather than BDD; the differential diagnosis between BDD and trichotillomania is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=body-dysmorphic-disorder-assessment-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis#H135266\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Body dysmorphic disorder: Assessment, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder)'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Seeking reassurance of others</strong> &ndash; About half of patients frequently seek reassurance from others about how they look and whether they look acceptable. However, patients typically do not believe the reassurance they receive because their insight is usually poor. (See <a href=\"#H223178\" class=\"local\">'Poor insight and delusions'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Clothes changing</strong> &ndash; Nearly half of patients change their clothes many (eg, &ge;4) times a day to try to camouflage disliked body areas. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Skin picking &ndash;</strong> More than one-third of patients compulsively pick their skin to try to make their skin look better (eg, smoother or completely blemish free). Some patients use sharp implements, such as pins, needles, razor blades, or knives. Injury to the skin, which can cause scarring and is occasionally life-threatening (due to infections or ruptured blood vessels), can occur. However, patients do not intend to injure or harm themselves. Thus, patients who pick their skin can be an exception to the rule that those with BDD do not have obvious appearance flaws. The differential diagnosis between skin picking (excoriation) disorder and BDD is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=body-dysmorphic-disorder-assessment-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis#H39059628\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Body dysmorphic disorder: Assessment, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Skin picking (excoriation) disorder'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Excessive exercising or weight lifting &ndash; </strong>Excessive exercising or weight lifting<strong> </strong>is especially common in<strong> </strong>men with the muscle dysmorphia form of BDD. (See <a href=\"#H62823992\" class=\"local\">'Muscle dysmorphia'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Compulsive shopping &ndash; </strong>Some individuals compulsively shop for skin or hair products, make-up, or clothes to minimize their &ldquo;flaws.&rdquo; They are usually disappointed with the results.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other behaviors &ndash; </strong>Patients may perform many other behaviors to check, fix, or hide the perceived appearance flaws. As an example, patients may frequently check online for ways to fix the perceived flaws, measure disliked body areas, touch disliked areas to examine them, or excessively wash their face or shower to prevent acne.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H223178\"><span class=\"h2\">Poor insight and delusions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>BDD is typically characterized by either overvalued ideas or delusions, such that insight regarding the perceived appearance defects is usually poor or absent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Thus, most patients are mostly or completely certain that the disliked body areas truly look ugly or abnormal. In addition, approximately 60 percent of patients have ideas or delusions of reference, believing that other people take special notice of the &ldquo;defective&rdquo; body areas, talk about the patient, or make fun of the patient&rsquo;s physical appearance, all of which can contribute to social avoidance. (See <a href=\"#H62823985\" class=\"local\">'Social avoidance'</a> below.)</p><p>The delusional variant of BDD represents a more severe subtype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. In addition, poor or absent insight (ie, delusional beliefs) often make it difficult to engage patients in psychiatric treatment, and many seek surgery and other cosmetic procedures instead. (See <a href=\"#H281269\" class=\"local\">'Cosmetic interventions'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H62823985\"><span class=\"h2\">Social avoidance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Social avoidance is common in BDD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/body-dysmorphic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features/abstract/11,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,39</a>]. Many patients isolate themselves because they fear that other people will see the &ldquo;deformity,&rdquo; or fear rejection or ridicule because of &ldquo;ugliness.&rdquo; Thus, many patients are housebound and avoid dating and physical intimacy.

Studies suggest that genetic factors are involved; neuroimaging and other studies suggest that BDD is associated with abnormal visual processing, with a bias for encoding and analyzing details of faces, as well as non-face objects, rather than using holistic visual processing strategies (ie, seeing &ldquo;the big picture&rdquo;). Perceived neglect and abuse may also play a role. (See <a href=\"#H62823957\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BDD is characterized by preoccupation with nonexistent or slight defects in physical appearance that lead to repetitive behaviors as well as distress <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> functional impairment.

The most commonly disliked body parts are skin, hair, and nose. (See <a href=\"#H62823964\" class=\"local\">'Appearance preoccupations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A core aspect of BDD is compulsions, which are repetitive behaviors or mental acts that are driven by appearance preoccupations. The compulsive behaviors are intended to fix, hide, inspect, or obtain reassurance about the disliked body parts. These time-consuming behaviors are usually difficult to control, are not pleasurable, and often fail to relieve distress. Repetitive behaviors include camouflaging, comparing one&rsquo;s disliked features with those of other people, mirror checking, excessive grooming, seeking reassurance from others, and skin picking. (See <a href=\"#H62823978\" class=\"local\">'Compulsions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BDD is typically characterized by either overvalued ideas or delusions, such that insight regarding the perceived appearance defects is usually poor or absent. (See <a href=\"#H223178\" class=\"local\">'Poor insight and delusions'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle dysmorphia is a form of BDD that occurs almost exclusively in males and consists of a pathological belief that one&rsquo;s body is too small, or should be more lean or muscular. (See <a href=\"#H62823992\" class=\"local\">'Muscle dysmorphia'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with BDD obtain dermatologic, surgical, or other cosmetic treatments in an attempt to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; their perceived appearance flaws. However, BDD symptoms appear to respond poorly to cosmetic procedures in the large majority of cases and may even worsen. (See <a href=\"#H281269\" class=\"local\">'Cosmetic interventions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with BDD commonly manifest comorbid psychopathology, including unipolar major depression, social anxiety disorder, personality disorders, substance use disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and eating disorders. (See <a href=\"#H281998\" class=\"local\">'Comorbidity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other clinical manifestations of BDD include social avoidance, emotional distress, neurocognitive dysfunction, poor psychosocial functioning and quality of life, and suicidal ideation and behavior.
