In patients with asthma, the PEFR percent predicted correlates reasonably well with the percent predicted value for the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>). Monitoring the PEFR is useful for detecting changes or trends in a patient's asthma control, although significant testing variability makes it important to confirm or exclude airflow limitation with a more reliable test, such as spirometry.</p><p>The management of asthma depends in part on the ability of patients to monitor their condition on a regular basis. Self-monitoring can be performed by subjectively evaluating the frequency and severity of symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F62691\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62691 \">figure 1</a>). Patients can gain further information by monitoring peak expiratory flow rates (PEFRs), which provide an objective measurement of airflow obstruction, and can be performed accurately by most adults and children older than five years of age.</p><p>Peak expiratory flow rate monitoring in patients with asthma will be reviewed here. Other aspects of asthma management are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-asthma-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of asthma management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pulmonary function testing in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary function testing in asthma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-treatment-in-adolescents-and-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Asthma treatment in adolescents and adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3202343930\"><span class=\"h1\">PEFR VARIABILITY FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF ASTHMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Documentation of PEFR variability may be used to support the diagnosis of asthma. Patients can be asked to record PEFR upon awakening, in the evening, and before bed. Peak flow variability is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum peak flow in a day, expressed as a percentage of that day's minimum PEFR. Within-day or between-day variability in PEFR of &gt;20 percent is characteristic of asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peak-expiratory-flow-rate-monitoring-in-asthma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma#H226577483\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary function testing in asthma&quot;, section on 'Peak expiratory flow'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ROLE OF PEFR MONITORING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal role of long- or short-term daily monitoring in the ongoing management of asthma is unknown. The theoretic advantage is that daily PEFR monitoring can provide the patient and clinician with objective data upon which to base therapeutic decisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peak-expiratory-flow-rate-monitoring-in-asthma/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. However, adherence to long-term monitoring is difficult to maintain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peak-expiratory-flow-rate-monitoring-in-asthma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. According to some reports, adherence with home PEFR recording is satisfactory in the short term, but falls off considerably after several months. This suggests a significant limitation to this form of monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peak-expiratory-flow-rate-monitoring-in-asthma/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. While patient adherence to PEFR monitoring is highly variable, connecting its use to the production of data relevant to concrete self-management activities may increase adherence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peak-expiratory-flow-rate-monitoring-in-asthma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Studies evaluating the efficacy of PEFR monitoring for improving various outcome measures in asthma have yielded conflicting results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peak-expiratory-flow-rate-monitoring-in-asthma/abstract/8-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-21</a>]. A number of studies failed to demonstrate an advantage of using PEFR monitoring over symptom monitoring to guide self-management actions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peak-expiratory-flow-rate-monitoring-in-asthma/abstract/8-10,13,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10,13,15-17</a>]. Studies that demonstrated an improvement in outcomes, such as decreased health care utilization and improved quality of life, included a comprehensive management approach, which did not separate out the specific effect of PEFR monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peak-expiratory-flow-rate-monitoring-in-asthma/abstract/11,14,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,14,21</a>]. Further research on the efficacy of regular peak flow monitoring by patients is needed.</p><p>The most conservative approach is to have patients monitor their condition using both objective and subjective measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peak-expiratory-flow-rate-monitoring-in-asthma/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. This can be accomplished by using a patient diary to record daily PEFR readings and the presence of any asthma symptoms. This dual approach may help patients observe a cause-and-effect relationship between exposure to triggers and decrements in peak flow <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> exacerbations of asthma. The patient should understand that such monitoring is undertaken to check on the effectiveness of therapy and to give early warning of potential deterioration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peak-expiratory-flow-rate-monitoring-in-asthma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This approach may be particularly helpful for patients who have difficulty perceiving symptoms or exacerbating factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peak-expiratory-flow-rate-monitoring-in-asthma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Patients with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma should record both the PEFR and their symptoms in an asthma monitoring diary. Examples of asthma monitoring diaries that can be printed and given to patients are provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F62691\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62691 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76505\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef76505 \">form 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72953\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72953 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peak-expiratory-flow-rate-monitoring-in-asthma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Note that the diary can also be used to track medication use.</p><p>PEFR values can be compared to age-, gender- and height-matched normal subjects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57257%7EPULM%2F62839%7EPULM%2F64420\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57257 graphicRef62839 graphicRef64420 \">table 2A-C</a>)(<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-peak-expiratory-flow-prediction-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). The predicted values for black and Hispanic minorities are approximately 10 percent lower than those shown in the tables [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peak-expiratory-flow-rate-monitoring-in-asthma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. When determining predicted PEFR values, the reference values should be derived from a peak flow meter, rather than spirometric values, as the latter tend to be lower than peak flow meter predicted values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peak-expiratory-flow-rate-monitoring-in-asthma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">HOW TO MONITOR PEFR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When patients are first instructed in home monitoring of peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), they should be asked to demonstrate the use of the peak flow meter for the provider, who can then assess proper technique and make necessary adjustments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F53856\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53856 \">table 3</a>). The patient's technique should be reviewed frequently to ensure that it remains correct. It has been noted that without ongoing review of PEFR records, there is a progressive decline in recorded PEFR values, possibly caused by reduced expiratory effort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peak-expiratory-flow-rate-monitoring-in-asthma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. When patients are taught how to record and interpret their PEFR, it is helpful to explain that variability is important to monitor in addition to the absolute value of peak expiratory flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peak-expiratory-flow-rate-monitoring-in-asthma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-use-a-peak-flow-meter-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: How to use a peak flow meter (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Establishment of baseline measures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step is to establish a baseline measure with which to compare future readings. Ideally, the baseline values should be obtained when the patient is feeling well after a period of maximal asthma therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peak-expiratory-flow-rate-monitoring-in-asthma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The patient should then record PEFR measurements two to four times daily for two weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peak-expiratory-flow-rate-monitoring-in-asthma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>This information is then used to define that patient's individual &quot;personal best&quot; PEFR value. The personal best is generally the highest PEFR measurement achieved during this post-treatment monitoring period. The patient's normal PEFR range is defined as 80 and 100 percent of the patient's personal best.</p><p>Readings below this normal range indicate airway narrowing, which can occur prior to the onset of symptoms. </p><p>Each patient's personal best value must be reevaluated annually to account for growth in children and disease progression in both children and adults. In addition, the PEFR measurements should be periodically correlated with office spirometry, since the PEFR in some cases has been less accurate than measurement of FEV<sub>1</sub> in detecting airflow obstruction. In one study, for example, changes of 15 percent or more in FEV<sub>1</sub> between two clinic visits were not detected by PEFR in up to 43 percent of patients; on the other hand, 33 percent of subjects with less than a 15 percent change in FEV<sub>1</sub> had changes in PEFR of 15 percent or more [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peak-expiratory-flow-rate-monitoring-in-asthma/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. PEFR should be compared to office spirometry results at least once a year, or any time there is a question about the validity of PEFR measurements.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Instructions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once a normal range has been established, the clinician should provide clear instructions for the patient to follow when PEFR begins to decline in the form of an &quot;asthma action plan&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55900\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef55900 \">form 2</a>). The frequency of PEFR monitoring depends on the needs of the individual patient. A patient who is a poor perceiver of asthma symptoms may need to measure PEFR every morning and evening, both before and after using inhaled medications, and when symptoms of asthma are noted. Another patient with more stable asthma may only need to measure PEFR when experiencing symptoms or when they are at risk for an asthma flare such as during an upper respiratory infection.</p><p>Instructions from the clinician should be part of the patient's comprehensive asthma management plan, along with proper use of medications and strategies for attack prevention and control. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enhancing-patient-adherence-to-asthma-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Enhancing patient adherence to asthma therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is suggested that a zone scheme similar to a traffic light system be used to illustrate a plan upon which patients can base self-management decisions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GREEN (80 to 100 percent of personal best) signals &quot;all clear.&quot; When readings are within this range and symptoms are not present, the patient is advised to adhere to his or her regular maintenance regimen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>YELLOW (50 to 80 percent of personal best) signals &quot;caution,&quot; since the airways are somewhat obstructed.

The wide range represented by the yellow zone can be subdivided above and below the 65 percent level if desired.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RED (below 50 percent of personal best) signals &quot;medical alert.&quot; Bronchodilator therapy should be started immediately, and the clinician should be contacted if PEFR measures do not return immediately to the yellow or green zones.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H746302973\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
