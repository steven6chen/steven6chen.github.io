The term &quot;glioma&quot; refers to tumors that have histologic features similar to normal glial cells (ie, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and ependymal cells). For each of these types of gliomas, there are neoplasms that span a broad spectrum of biologic aggressiveness.</p><p>Historically, the slower-growing lesions, corresponding to World Health Organization (WHO) grades I and II, have been commonly referred to as low-grade gliomas, while the more rapidly progressive tumors are referred to as high-grade gliomas. The WHO classification recommends avoiding the term &quot;low-grade glioma,&quot; however, since it lumps together a heterogenous groups of tumors, many of which have significantly different biologic properties, prognoses, and treatment approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathologic-diagnosis-of-gliomas/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Among grade I and grade II gliomas, for example, current classification favors a distinction between diffuse gliomas (eg, grade II diffuse astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma) and more circumscribed astrocytic tumors (eg, grade I pilocytic astrocytoma).</p><p>The classification and diagnosis of gliomas will be reviewed here. Pathogenesis of diffuse gliomas is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-pathogenesis-of-diffuse-gliomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular pathogenesis of diffuse gliomas&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY OF GLIOMA CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classification and grading of gliomas have evolved over time, beginning in 1926 with a system devised by Bailey and Cushing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathologic-diagnosis-of-gliomas/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] and later revised by Kernohan, Ringertz, and others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathologic-diagnosis-of-gliomas/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. Modern classification of gliomas is based on the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Central Nervous System Tumors, first published in 1979 and revised four times since then, most recently in 2016 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathologic-diagnosis-of-gliomas/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>As of the 2016 edition of the WHO classification, gliomas are classified based not only on histopathologic appearance but also on well-established molecular parameters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathologic-diagnosis-of-gliomas/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The incorporation of molecular features has most notably impacted the classification of astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors, which are now grouped together as diffuse gliomas, on the basis of growth pattern, behavior, and shared isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) genetic status.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3482246298\"><span class=\"h1\">KEY MOLECULAR DIAGNOSTIC TESTS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2243056697\"><span class=\"h2\">IDH1/IDH2 mutations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase type 1 (<em>IDH1</em>) and, less commonly, type 2 (<em>IDH2</em>), are a defining feature of the majority of World Health Organization (WHO) grade II and III diffuse astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors and confer significantly improved prognosis compared with IDH-wildtype tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathologic-diagnosis-of-gliomas/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H89359691\" class=\"local\">'Diffuse astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors'</a> below.)</p><p>Immunohistochemical staining for the most common mutant form of IDH1 (R132) should be performed on all diffuse glioma specimens for diagnostic purposes. This test can also help distinguish infiltrating astrocytoma cells from reactive gliosis in biopsy specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathologic-diagnosis-of-gliomas/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>Less common mutations in <em>IDH1</em> and all <em>IDH2</em> mutations will not be identified using this antibody but can be detected using DNA sequencing approaches. These noncanonical mutations make up approximately 10 to 20 percent of IDH mutations in grade II and III diffuse astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors and, like IDH1 R132 mutations, are found primarily in patients younger than 55 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathologic-diagnosis-of-gliomas/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Noncanonical IDH mutations may be less common in astrocytic gliomas.</p><p>If immunohistochemistry for mutant IDH1 R132H is negative, sequencing of <em>IDH1</em> (codon 132) and <em>IDH2</em> (codon 172) should be prioritized in patients with grade II and grade III diffuse gliomas and in younger patients (&lt;55 years) with glioblastomas, as the distinction between IDH-mutant and IDH-wildtype is central to an integrated diagnosis. When such testing cannot be performed, a diagnosis of &quot;not otherwise specified (NOS)&quot; must be given. (See <a href=\"#H2571145869\" class=\"local\">'NOS designation'</a> below.)</p><p>Mutations in IDH lead to the accumulation of R(-)-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), which can be detected by magnetic imaging spectroscopy (MRS) and may play a key role in glioma formation and epigenetic dysregulation.

Testing for <span class=\"nowrap\">1p/19q-codeletion</span> status should be performed on all tumors with oligodendroglial differentiation. Most diagnostic laboratories currently assess <span class=\"nowrap\">1p/19q</span> status using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), since this technique provides information on chromosomal losses, polysomies, and intratumoral variation, but FISH risks false-positive results in the presence of partial 1p <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> 19q losses.</p><p>Combined whole-arm loss of 1p and 19q is invariably associated with IDH mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathologic-diagnosis-of-gliomas/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Therefore, detection of <span class=\"nowrap\">1p/19q</span> codeletion (by a technique such as FISH) in the absence of an IDH mutation (confirmed by sequencing of <em>IDH1</em> and <em>IDH2</em> if immunohistochemistry for IDH1 R132 is negative) should raise suspicion for partial or incomplete deletions, which have been associated with some subsets of IDH-wildtype high-grade astrocytomas and a more aggressive clinical course. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2779597724\"><span class=\"h2\">ATRX mutation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mutations in the chromatin regulator gene, <span class=\"nowrap\">alpha-thalassemia/mental</span> retardation syndrome X-linked (<em>ATRX</em>), are commonly found in diffuse astrocytic gliomas. <em>ATRX</em> mutations are closely correlated with <em><span class=\"nowrap\">IDH1/2</em></span> and <em>TP53</em> mutations and are mutually exclusive with <span class=\"nowrap\">1p/19q</span> codeletion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F91840\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef91840 \">figure 1</a>).

Pilocytic astrocytomas occur predominantly in children and young adults, although they are occasionally seen in older individuals as well.

Pilocytic astrocytomas often have a tandem duplication of chromosome 7q34, which is associated with a <em>BRAF</em>-<em>KIAA</em> fusion gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathologic-diagnosis-of-gliomas/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Some pilocytic astrocytomas, particularly supratentorial ones, may have <em>BRAF</em> V600E mutations. Pilocytic astrocytomas seen in conjunction with neurofibromatosis type 1 lack this fusion gene.</p><p>Although almost always circumscribed on imaging studies, pilocytic astrocytomas enhance on computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning because their blood vessels undergo degenerative changes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78521\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef78521 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathologic-diagnosis-of-gliomas/abstract/34,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,42,43</a>].
