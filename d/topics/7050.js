The most common cause of ketoacidosis is diabetic ketoacidosis. Two other causes are fasting ketosis and alcoholic ketoacidosis.</p><p>Fasting ketosis and alcoholic ketoacidosis will be reviewed here. Issues related to diabetic ketoacidosis are discussed in detail elsewhere.

Beta-hydroxybutyric acid is a hydroxyacid, not a true ketoacid. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acetone, which is formed from the decarboxylation of acetic acid, is a true ketone but <strong>not</strong> an acid. </p><p/><p>Ketone bodies are water-soluble, fat-derived fuels that are used by many tissues for energy generation when there is limited glucose availability. The brain becomes especially dependent upon ketones for fuel when plasma glucose levels are inadequate. In most patients, neurologic manifestations of hypoglycemia begin at a plasma glucose concentration of less than 50 to 55 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [2.8 to 3.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]</span>. By contrast, neurologic manifestations are not typically seen until the plasma glucose concentration falls to much lower levels in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (due to the availability of ketones) and in patients with repeated episodes of hypoglycemia as may be caused by intensive therapy of diabetes or an insulinoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypoglycemia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-definition-and-causes#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypoglycemia in adults: Clinical manifestations, definition, and causes&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypoglycemia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-definition-and-causes#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypoglycemia in adults: Clinical manifestations, definition, and causes&quot;, section on 'Laboratory findings'</a>.) </p><p>Hepatic generation of ketone bodies is usually stimulated by the combination of low insulin levels and high glucagon levels (ie, a low <span class=\"nowrap\">insulin/glucagon</span> ratio) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fasting-ketosis-and-alcoholic-ketoacidosis/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>]. Low insulin levels, which are most often secondary to absolute or relative hypoglycemia (as with fasting), activate hormone-sensitive lipase, which releases long chain fatty acids and glycerol from triglycerides in peripheral fat stores. The fatty acids are transported to the liver via the circulation where they enter hepatocyte mitochondria under the influence of low insulin and high glucagon levels.</p><p>Within the hepatocyte mitochondria, the fatty acids undergo beta-oxidation, generating acetyl-CoA. When large quantities of acetyl-CoA are generated, the oxidative capacity of the Krebs cycle may be exceeded, resulting in the entry of acetyl-CoA into the ketogenic pathway and the generation of ketone bodies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-ketoacidosis-and-hyperosmolar-hyperglycemic-state-in-adults-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in adults: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Ketone production'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H506562828\"><span class=\"h1\">FASTING KETOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hepatic generation of ketone bodies described in the preceding paragraph is the normal physiologic response to fasting. Mild ketosis (ketoacid concentration of about 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> generally develops after a 12- to 14-hour fast. If fasting continues, the ketoacid concentration continues to rise and peaks after 20 to 30 days at a concentration of 8 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(mmol/L</span> is used here rather than <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> since <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> does not apply to acetone, which has no charge). Beta-hydroxybutyrate is the major ketone body that accumulates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fasting-ketosis-and-alcoholic-ketoacidosis/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. </p><p>At a plasma ketone body concentration of 8 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L,</span> the rate of hepatic ketone body synthesis matches the rate of ketone body utilization in the brain, muscle, kidney, and other peripheral tissues, plus a small degree of ketone body loss into the urine. The net effect is that the plasma bicarbonate concentration usually falls by 7 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> (bicarbonate concentration of about 18 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L),</span> and the plasma anion gap is increased to a similar degree. The fall in plasma bicarbonate is often less than the rise in plasma ketone body concentration due to at least two factors: as mentioned in the preceding section, acetone is not an acid and therefore does not affect the plasma bicarbonate, and some of the hydrogen ions in the ketoacids are buffered in the cells rather than the extracellular fluid. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-delta-anion-gap-delta-hco3-ratio-in-patients-with-a-high-anion-gap-metabolic-acidosis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The delta anion gap/delta HCO3 ratio in patients with a high anion gap metabolic acidosis&quot;, section on 'The delta AG/delta HCO3 in ketoacidosis'</a>.) </p><p>Stabilization of ketone body generation at a moderate level is due to the following factors: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A &quot;braking&quot; effect of the ketone bodies on the release of fatty acids from adipose tissue, which is mediated by at least three mechanisms: stimulation of insulin release (despite low glucose levels) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fasting-ketosis-and-alcoholic-ketoacidosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], increased sensitivity of adipose tissue to insulin's inhibitory effect on fatty acid release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fasting-ketosis-and-alcoholic-ketoacidosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and direct inhibition of lipolysis by the ketone bodies themselves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fasting-ketosis-and-alcoholic-ketoacidosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increased rate of central nervous system ketoacid uptake as the brain switches from glucose to ketones as its source of fuel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fasting-ketosis-and-alcoholic-ketoacidosis/abstract/3,4,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased peripheral tissue ketone utilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fasting-ketosis-and-alcoholic-ketoacidosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p>Since the degree of ketoacidosis usually remains relatively mild, the term &quot;ketosis&quot; is typically used rather than &quot;ketoacidosis.&quot; There is no evidence of adverse effects associated with fasting ketosis. </p><p>In addition to fasting, limited ketosis can also be induced by a low-carbohydrate diet (carbohydrate intake usually less than 40 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fasting-ketosis-and-alcoholic-ketoacidosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

This usually occurs when there is a relatively large glucose requirement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fasting-ketosis-and-alcoholic-ketoacidosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], as occurs with fasting in the very young (eg, normal neonates generally have some degree of ketosis for several days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fasting-ketosis-and-alcoholic-ketoacidosis/abstract/4,5,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,12</a>] or in pregnant or lactating women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fasting-ketosis-and-alcoholic-ketoacidosis/abstract/4,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,13,14</a>].</p><p>A number of cases of ketoacidosis have also been described in patients on very low-carbohydrate diets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fasting-ketosis-and-alcoholic-ketoacidosis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. The ketoacidosis in these patients is usually associated with moderate hyperglycemia. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H506562835\"><span class=\"h1\">ALCOHOLIC KETOACIDOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alcoholic ketoacidosis usually occurs in malnourished patients with chronic alcoholism who have a history of binge alcohol ingestion. Active drinking has often stopped because of the development of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. After one to two days, the patient presents to the hospital. Blood ethanol levels at this time may be low or not detectable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fasting-ketosis-and-alcoholic-ketoacidosis/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]. Although it had been thought that alcoholic ketoacidosis was more common in women, later studies found a similar incidence in men and women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fasting-ketosis-and-alcoholic-ketoacidosis/abstract/17,21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,21-23</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H506562842\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathophysiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ethanol is rapidly oxidized, mainly by hepatocytes, first to acetaldehyde and then to acetic acid. The acetic acid may be exported from the liver to be utilized for energy or converted to acetyl-CoA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fasting-ketosis-and-alcoholic-ketoacidosis/abstract/17,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,24</a>]. The acetyl-CoA can enter one of three possible pathways: oxidation in the Krebs cycle; fatty acid synthesis; or ketogenesis forming acetoacetic acid, beta-hydroxybutyric acid, and acetone. (See <a href=\"#H173634927\" class=\"local\">'Physiology of ketone bodies'</a> above.) </p><p>As noted above, liberal peripheral release of fatty acids and their delivery to the liver is required for the development of brisk ketogenesis. Although mild to moderate ketoacidosis can develop during active alcohol ingestion, severe ketoacidosis usually only occurs after ethanol ingestion has ceased. During active ethanol ingestion, its metabolism generates acetate and acetyl-CoA, which inhibit peripheral lipolysis, and this limits fatty acid delivery to the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fasting-ketosis-and-alcoholic-ketoacidosis/abstract/17,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,24</a>].</p><p>However, once ethanol levels begin to fall, increased levels of catecholamines (particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norepinephrine-noradrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norepinephrine</a>) and cortisol resulting from ethanol withdrawal amplify the hormonal responses to fasting (low insulin levels, high glucagon), causing a marked increase in lipolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fasting-ketosis-and-alcoholic-ketoacidosis/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. The oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde and then to acetic acid each converts NAD+ to NADH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fasting-ketosis-and-alcoholic-ketoacidosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. This redox shift of the <span class=\"nowrap\">NAD+/NADH</span> ratio toward NADH has the following effects:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It suppresses gluconeogenesis and may result in hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fasting-ketosis-and-alcoholic-ketoacidosis/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It drives acetoacetic acid toward beta-hydroxybutyric acid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F87660\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87660 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fasting-ketosis-and-alcoholic-ketoacidosis/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. The shift from acetoacetic acid to beta-hydroxybutyric acid has no effect on the degree of bicarbonate reduction or anion gap elevation, since both acids have an identical effect on these parameters. However, the redox shift may have diagnostic implications since the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroprusside</a> test to detect ketone bodies detects acetoacetate &ndash; and, to a much lesser degree, acetone &ndash; but not beta-hydroxybutyrate, which accounts for the majority of ketoacids. (See <a href=\"#H252598467\" class=\"local\">'Detection of ketone bodies'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It favors the conversion of pyruvate to lactate. This effect is usually not important clinically, and a significant lactic acidosis in a patient with alcoholic ketoacidosis should prompt a search for other, more common disorders that are causes of a marked reduction in tissue perfusion, such as hypovolemia, heart failure, or sepsis. (See <a href=\"#H133228294\" class=\"local\">'Combined acid-base disorders'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-lactic-acidosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of lactic acidosis&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H506562849\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with alcoholic ketoacidosis typically present with a history of chronic alcohol abuse, malnutrition, and a recent episode of binge drinking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fasting-ketosis-and-alcoholic-ketoacidosis/abstract/17-23,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-23,27</a>].

These symptoms typically develop at the end of the binge, as described in the preceding section (see <a href=\"#H506562842\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above), and may persist for one to two days <strong>prior</strong> to presentation with ketoacidosis.

A probable explanation for this difference is that the neurologic manifestations of diabetic ketoacidosis, which are even more common in patients with nonketotic hyperosmolar hyperglycemia, are primary due to a marked rise in the effective plasma osmolality (ie, not including urea, which is an ineffective osmole since it equilibrates across cell membranes). Water loss induced by the osmotic diuresis is a major contributor to the rise in effective plasma osmolality. These factors are <strong>not</strong> present in alcoholic ketoacidosis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H133228287\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For the reasons described above, plasma alcohol levels may be low or <strong>not</strong> detectable at presentation in patients with alcoholic ketoacidosis, since clinically significant ketone body formation typically occurs as ethanol levels fall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fasting-ketosis-and-alcoholic-ketoacidosis/abstract/17,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,32</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H506562842\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.) </p><p>The detection of ketone bodies in such patients is discussed below. Several changes in laboratory methodology have had a major impact on these measurements. (See <a href=\"#H252598467\" class=\"local\">'Detection of ketone bodies'</a> below.) </p><p>Patients with alcoholic ketoacidosis may have a variety of other laboratory abnormalities, as described in the following sections. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H290422870\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plasma glucose levels may be reduced, normal, or modestly elevated but are almost always less than 275 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (15.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fasting-ketosis-and-alcoholic-ketoacidosis/abstract/17,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,22</a>]. In a series of 74 patients with alcoholic ketoacidosis, nine (12 percent) had a plasma glucose less than 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> and eight (11 percent) had a plasma glucose greater than 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (13.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fasting-ketosis-and-alcoholic-ketoacidosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. None of these patients had a history of diabetes mellitus or subsequent evidence of glucose intolerance after initial treatment in the hospital. Measurement of hemoglobin A1C may be helpful since an elevated value suggests chronic hyperglycemia. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H360030380\"><span class=\"h3\">Potassium depletion and hypokalemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Potassium deficits can be induced by both gastrointestinal losses (vomiting or diarrhea) and urinary losses caused by the excretion of potassium salts of ketone anions (beta-hydroxybutyrate and, to a lesser degree, acetoacetate). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-ketoacidosis-and-hyperosmolar-hyperglycemic-state-in-adults-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in adults: Clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Serum potassium'</a>.)</p><p>There are additional issues related to potassium balance in patients with alcoholic ketoacidosis. In some forms of metabolic acidosis, potassium moves from cells into the extracellular fluid and raises the plasma potassium concentration. This occurs because more than one-half of the excess hydrogen ions are buffered in the cells, with electroneutrality being maintained by potassium movement from the cells into the extracellular fluid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F68866\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68866 \">figure 2</a>). By contrast, potassium shift out of the cells is much <strong>less likely</strong> to occur in ketoacidosis due, at least in part, to the ability of the hydrogen ion and the ketoacid anion to enter the cells together via a sodium-organic anion cotransporter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fasting-ketosis-and-alcoholic-ketoacidosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. A similar process occurs in lactic acidosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F57068\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57068 \">figure 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-balance-in-acid-base-disorders#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Potassium balance in acid-base disorders&quot;, section on 'Metabolic acidosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-evaluation-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults#H446278642\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and evaluation of hyperkalemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Absent effect in lactic acidosis or ketoacidosis'</a>.)</p><p>By contrast, major potassium redistribution from cells into the extracellular space does occur in diabetic ketoacidosis because of the hyperosmolality generated by marked hyperglycemia, which does not occur in alcoholic ketoacidosis. This is why the serum potassium concentration is normal or elevated in the majority of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis despite total body potassium depletion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-ketoacidosis-and-hyperosmolar-hyperglycemic-state-in-adults-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in adults: Clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Serum potassium'</a>.) </p><p>Poor nutrition and reduced oral potassium intake also contribute to hypokalemia in patients with alcoholic ketoacidosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H360030387\"><span class=\"h3\">Phosphate depletion and hypophosphatemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phosphate depletion is common in chronic alcohol abusers who often have decreased phosphate intake, reduced intestinal phosphate absorption, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> increased urinary phosphate excretion.

The transcellular phosphate shift is reversed, and overt hypophosphatemia often occurs early in the hospitalization. One or both of the following factors are primarily responsible for the movement of phosphate into the cells after hospitalization: dextrose administration, which stimulates the release of insulin; and alcohol withdrawal, which may be associated with acute respiratory alkalosis.

The urinary loss of ketoacid anions with sodium or potassium will lower the plasma anion gap toward normal, but the acidosis will persist since there has been no increase in net acid excretion or bicarbonate generation. By contrast, the loss of ketoacid anions with either hydrogen or ammonium will lower the anion gap and raise the serum bicarbonate concentration toward normal.

In a study cited above of 74 patients with alcoholic ketoacidosis, 11 percent had a serum glucose concentration greater than 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (13.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fasting-ketosis-and-alcoholic-ketoacidosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

The presence of ketone bodies can be detected by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroprusside</a> testing and by direct assays of beta-hydroxybutyrate levels in serum. These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere, but this section will provide a brief review. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21562937\"><span class=\"h3\">Nitroprusside testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urine dipstick testing with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroprusside</a> tablets (Acetest) or reagent sticks (Ketostix) has the advantage of the results being available within minutes. Serum testing is necessary to determine whether serum ketone levels can explain the high anion gap acidosis. A 4+ reaction with serum diluted 1:1 is highly suggestive of ketoacidosis. A 4+ reaction in more dilute serum (ie, 1:4, 1:8, etc) provides evidence of even higher concentrations of acetoacetic acid. Although one cannot directly extrapolate from the nitroprusside result to the severity of the acidosis or the magnitude of the anion gap, this semiquantitative test is helpful in evaluating ketoacidosis as a diagnostic possibility. </p><p>Although the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroprusside</a> reaction is widely used to detect ketone bodies, the clinician must be aware of both <strong>false-negative</strong> results and, in selected settings, <strong>false-positive</strong> results.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21562957\"><span class=\"h4\">False-negative nitroprusside testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Nitroprusside</a> reacts with acetoacetate and, to a much lesser degree, acetone (which is not an acid). However, nitroprusside does <strong>not </strong>react with beta-hydroxybutyrate. This is an important limitation since beta-hydroxybutyrate is usually present at higher concentrations than acetoacetate. The ratio of beta-hydroxybutyrate to acetoacetate is normally 1:1, increases to 3:1 in diabetic ketoacidosis, and may increase to 10:1 in alcoholic ketoacidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fasting-ketosis-and-alcoholic-ketoacidosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The higher beta-hydroxybutyrate-to-acetoacetate ratio in alcoholic patients is due to a higher <span class=\"nowrap\">NAD+/NADH</span> ratio generated by alcohol metabolism. Thus, in most patients with alcoholic ketoacidosis, nitroprusside tests <strong>underestimate</strong> the degree of ketone bodies in plasma, and some patients may have negative tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fasting-ketosis-and-alcoholic-ketoacidosis/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>].</p><p>It has been suggested that the sensitivity of the urine <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroprusside</a> test can be improved by adding a few drops of hydrogen peroxide to a urine specimen in an attempt to nonenzymatically convert beta-hydroxybutyrate into acetoacetate.

(See <a href=\"#H506562821\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are three major ketone bodies, with the interrelationships shown in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F87660\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87660 \">figure 1</a>) (see <a href=\"#H173634927\" class=\"local\">'Physiology of ketone bodies'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Acetoacetic acid is the only true ketoacid.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The more dominant acid in patients with ketoacidosis is beta-hydroxybutyric acid, which results from the reduction of acetoacetic acid by NADH. Beta-hydroxybutyric acid is a hydroxyacid, not a true ketoacid. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Acetone, which is formed from the decarboxylation of acetic acid, is a true ketone but <strong>not</strong> an acid. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatic generation of ketone bodies is usually stimulated by the combination of low insulin levels and high glucagon levels (ie, a low <span class=\"nowrap\">insulin/glucagon</span> ratio that can result, for example, from fasting). (See <a href=\"#H173634927\" class=\"local\">'Physiology of ketone bodies'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild ketosis generally develops after a 12- to 14-hour fast. As fasting continues, the plasma ketone body concentration usually stabilizes at 8 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span>. Beta-hydroxybutyrate is the major ketone body that accumulates. (See <a href=\"#H506562828\" class=\"local\">'Fasting ketosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In normal fasting subjects, when the a plasma ketone body concentration is 8 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L,</span> the rate of hepatic ketone body synthesis matches the rate of ketone body utilization in the brain, muscle, kidney, and other peripheral tissues, plus a small degree of ketone body loss into the urine. The net effect is that the plasma bicarbonate concentration usually falls by 7 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> (bicarbonate concentration of about 18 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L),</span> and the plasma anion gap is increased to a similar degree. Since the degree of ketoacidosis usually remains relatively mild, the term &quot;ketosis&quot; is typically used rather than &quot;ketoacidosis.&quot; There is no evidence of adverse effects associated with fasting ketosis, unless there is a relatively large glucose requirement, as occurs with fasting in the very young or in pregnant or lactating women. (See <a href=\"#H506562828\" class=\"local\">'Fasting ketosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alcoholic ketoacidosis usually occurs in malnourished patients with chronic alcoholism who have a history of binge alcohol ingestion. Active drinking has often stopped because of the development of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Blood ethanol levels at this time may be low or not detectable. (See <a href=\"#H506562835\" class=\"local\">'Alcoholic ketoacidosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As ethanol levels begin to fall, increased levels of catecholamines (particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norepinephrine-noradrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norepinephrine</a>) and cortisol resulting from ethanol withdrawal amplify the hormonal responses to fasting (low insulin levels, high glucagon), causing a marked increase in lipolysis and fatty acid delivery to the liver. (See <a href=\"#H506562842\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with alcoholic ketoacidosis typically present with a history of chronic alcohol abuse, malnutrition, and a recent episode of binge drinking. A variety of clinical manifestations are commonly seen in patients with alcoholic ketoacidosis, including (see <a href=\"#H506562849\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Generalized abdominal tenderness, hepatomegaly, and laboratory evidence of alcoholic hepatitis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pancreatitis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hypovolemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> potassium depletion</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tachycardia and hypertension due to alcohol withdrawal, pancreatitis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> volume depletion, as outlined above</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Increased respiratory rate, due to alcohol withdrawal, pain, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> respiratory compensation for the metabolic acidosis </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plasma alcohol levels may be low or undetectable at presentation in patients with alcoholic ketoacidosis. In addition, such patients may have hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia, an elevated serum osmolal gap, and mixed acid-base disorders. (See <a href=\"#H133228287\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of ketosis or ketoacidosis is suggested by an elevated anion gap and confirmed by detecting the presence of ketone bodies. The distinction of fasting ketosis from alcoholic ketoacidosis and of both of these disorders from diabetic ketoacidosis is a clinical judgment based upon the history, whether the patient has ketoacidosis or ketosis (as defined above), and the serum glucose concentration. (See <a href=\"#H6136905\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confirmation of the diagnosis of ketosis or ketoacidosis requires the demonstration of ketone bodies in the urine (ketonuria) and serum (ketonemia). The presence of ketone bodies can be detected by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroprusside</a> testing and by direct assays of beta-hydroxybutyrate levels in serum. (See <a href=\"#H252598467\" class=\"local\">'Detection of ketone bodies'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When a patient with a history of ethanol abuse presents with a high anion gap metabolic acidosis, alcoholic ketoacidosis must be distinguished from other causes, including diabetic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, poisoning due to methanol or ethylene glycol (which is more common in alcoholics), and, in patients with advanced, usually chronic kidney disease, uremic acidosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F77464\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77464 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H26430964\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The acidemia in all forms of ketoacidosis corrects at least partially with appropriate treatment of the underlying disease, which slows the rate of ketogenesis. As peripheral tissues and the brain continue to metabolize the ketone bodies, their levels will progressively fall. Oxidation of beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate (but not acetone) results in the regeneration of bicarbonate. Correction of the acidemia is usually <strong>not complete</strong> with treatment of the underlying disease, since the urinary loss of beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate with sodium or potassium to maintain electroneutrality represents the loss of &quot;potential bicarbonate.&quot; (See <a href=\"#H506562870\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In alcoholic patients, 100 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thiamine</a> should be given via the intravenous or intramuscular route. When hypoglycemia is present in patients with known or suspected thiamine deficiency, we recommend that dextrose be administered immediately and <strong>not</strong> be withheld pending administration of thiamine. Concerns that the administration of glucose before thiamine will precipitate or exacerbate Wernicke's encephalopathy are poorly supported by the medical literature. Thiamine should, however, be given as soon as possible after dextrose administration. (See <a href=\"#H26431161\" class=\"local\">'Thiamine before dextrose in alcoholic patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with alcoholic or fasting ketoacidosis, at least partial correction of the ketoacidosis can usually be achieved by the administration of dextrose and saline solutions. However, some patients with alcoholic ketoacidosis present with overt hyperglycemia. Such patients may require insulin administration rather than intravenous dextrose. Dextrose solutions should also be avoided in patients with severe hypokalemia since it stimulates insulin secretion, which drives potassium into the cells and can worsen the hypokalemia. (See <a href=\"#H840386573\" class=\"local\">'Dextrose and saline solutions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with alcoholic ketoacidosis may also require administration of potassium, phosphate, and magnesium. (See <a href=\"#H290424045\" class=\"local\">'Potassium administration'</a> above and <a href=\"#H840386967\" class=\"local\">'Phosphate administration'</a> above and <a href=\"#H290424053\" class=\"local\">'Magnesium administration'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Rose BD, Post TW.
