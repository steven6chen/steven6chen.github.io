Approximately 70 trematode species have been reported to colonize the human intestinal tract. The geographic distribution is worldwide; the highest prevalences are in East and Southeast Asia. Infection in the United States can be acquired via importation as well as locally; the most common species include <em>Nanophyetus</em>, <em>Alaria</em>, and <em>Heterophyes </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-flukes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Intestinal trematodes are among the commonest parasitic infections in humans and animals but are less associated with mortality than many other parasites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-flukes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Sources for transmission of human infection include fish, crustaceans, and aquatic plants, and endemicity of infection is associated with cultural and eating habits.</p><p>Four of the most frequently described intestinal flukes will be reviewed here: <em>Fasciolopsis buski</em>, <em>Heterophyes heterophyes</em>, <em>Metagonimus yokogawai</em>, and <em>Echinostoma</em> species.</p><p>Issues related to liver flukes are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-flukes-clonorchis-opisthorchis-and-metorchis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver flukes: Clonorchis, Opisthorchis, and Metorchis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-flukes-fascioliasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver flukes: Fascioliasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">FASCIOLOPSIASIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>F. buski</em> is the largest intestinal fluke of humans; pigs are also mammalian hosts. The infection is common in Southeast Asia and the Far East, especially in areas where humans raise pigs and consume freshwater plants.</p><p>The life cycle begins with release of immature eggs in mammalian stool (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F65448\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65448 \">figure 1</a>). These eggs become embryonated in water and release miracidia, which enter snail intermediate hosts. In the snail, the parasites undergo several developmental stages (sporocysts, rediae, and cercariae). The cercariae are released from the snail and encyst as metacercariae on aquatic plants, where they can survive for prolonged periods (often up to a year). Mammalian hosts become infected by ingesting metacercariae on the aquatic plants. After ingestion, the metacercariae excyst in the duodenum and attach to the intestinal wall, where they develop into adult flukes in approximately three months. Adult worms are 2 to 7.5 cm long and 1 to 2 cm wide; they have a lifespan of about one year and produce approximately 25,000 eggs daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-flukes/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Transmission to humans is typically associated with ingestion of contaminated water or plants, particularly bamboo shoots, watercress, or water chestnuts. The prevalence of infection is highest among children in endemic areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-flukes/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fasciolopsiasis is usually asymptomatic. When symptoms do occur, it is usually in the setting of heavy infection (often &gt;500 worms), and the onset is typically 30 to 60 days after exposure. Symptoms are due to inflammation, ulceration, and microabscesses that can develop where the flukes attach to the intestine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-flukes/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and signs of malabsorption can occur. The malabsorption is occasionally severe enough to lead to edema and ascites due to significant protein loss. Vitamin B12 deficiency and anemia can also occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-flukes/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Rarely, large numbers of flukes can lead to intestinal obstruction or perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-flukes/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Marked peripheral eosinophilia may be present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis is established by demonstrating either adult worms or eggs in the stool or other fluids (eg, vomitus, bile, duodenal material, or gastric washing samples) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F70390\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70390 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F79679\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79679 \">picture 2</a>). The size ranges from 2 to 7.5 cm in length, with a width of about 1 to 2.5 cm.</p><p>Several diagnostic methods are available for identifying eggs, including direct fecal smears, Kato-Katz thick smears, sedimentation techniques, or the formalin-ethyl-acetate technique. The Kato-Katz and formalin-ethyl-acetate techniques are used most commonly and allow quantification of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-flukes/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The eggs are unembryonated and have an inconspicuous operculum; they generally measure 130 to 150 micrometers long by 60 to 90 micrometers wide. Often they cannot be distinguished from <em>Fasciola hepatica</em> on morphology alone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-flukes-fascioliasis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver flukes: Fascioliasis&quot;, section on 'Fasciola hepatica'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-stool-microscopy#H4229859258\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to stool microscopy&quot;, section on 'Kato-Katz technique'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=praziquantel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Praziquantel</a> is the favored treatment; there are no randomized trials evaluating therapy or dosing. A single dose (15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> is likely sufficient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-flukes/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]; the World Health Organization recommends 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> for treatment of all intestinal flukes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-flukes/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], while the Medical Letter favors 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (in three divided doses for one day) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-flukes/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The dead flukes are passed the day following treatment. In the setting of heavy infection, treatment can lead to intestinal obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-flukes/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">HETEROPHYIASIS AND METAGONIMIASIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are multiple species of <em>Heterophyes </em>and <em>Metagonimus </em>trematodes; the most common are <em>H. heterophyes</em> and <em>M. yokogawai</em>. Other less common species include <em>Haplorchis</em> and <em>Carneophallus</em>. These parasites are considered minute intestinal flukes because they are typically less than 0.5 mm in length [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-flukes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p><em>H. heterophyes</em> causes infection predominantly in the Middle East, especially in Egypt, Sudan, and Iran. Other <em>Heterophyes</em> species are endemic in tropical areas of East Asia, including Korea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-flukes/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p><em>M. yokogawai</em> is common in East Asia (mainly Japan, China, Taiwan, and the Republic of Korea) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-flukes/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. One study from Korea showed prevalence rates of up to 19 percent in some areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-flukes/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The lifecycles of these flukes are similar to that of fasciolopsiasis, with snails as the first intermediate host. However, after cercariae are released from the snail, they penetrate the skin of fresh- or brackish-water fish and encyst as metacercariae in the tissue of the fish (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F75197\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75197 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F54222\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54222 \">figure 3</a>). Infection is acquired by ingesting undercooked fish. Definitive hosts include humans, dogs, cats, foxes, birds, and other fish-eating mammals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infection is frequently asymptomatic. Symptoms generally occur in patients with heavy infection or immune compromise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-flukes/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In general, onset of symptomatic infection is approximately nine days after ingestion of the contaminated fish.</p><p>The flukes attach to the intestinal mucosa and can cause ulcers and necrosis. Thus, infection can be associated with anorexia, nausea, abdominal pain, malabsorption, weight loss, dyspepsia, and diarrhea. One study performed in southern Philippines found that 36 percent of patients with abdominal discomfort <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diarrhea in the preceding four weeks had heterophyiasis; the most common clinical manifestation was dyspepsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-flukes/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Occasionally, eggs are hematogenously distributed to ectopic sites such as the heart, lungs, spleen, liver, or central nervous system, where space-occupying granulomatous lesions may induce clinical pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-flukes/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The flukes tend to live for less than a year.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis is established by finding characteristic eggs in the stool. The eggs are yellow and measure approximately 30 by 15 mcm; speciation based on eggs is difficult (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F64798\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64798 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-flukes/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In some cases, recovery of adult worms following helminthic therapy can facilitate species identification. The flukes measure less than 2.5 mm in length (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F66669\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66669 \">picture 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F54919\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54919 \">picture 5</a>). Peripheral eosinophilia may be present. New tests such as polymerase chain reaction and nucleotide sequencing for copro-DNA have been developed but are not commercially available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-flukes/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=praziquantel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Praziquantel</a> (75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> in three divided doses for one day) is the favored treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-flukes/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. There are no randomized trials evaluating therapy. Lower praziquantel doses (either 10 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> or 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> as a single dose) have also been used successfully, with cure rates of 95 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-flukes/abstract/10,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,15</a>]. The World Health Organization has indicated that a single 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> dose may be sufficient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-flukes/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">ECHINOSTOMIASIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Echinostoma</em> species are primarily intestinal parasites of birds and mammals; over 25 species of <em>Echinostoma </em>have been described to cause incidental infection in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-flukes/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. They are small, typically 3 to 10 mm in length and 1 to 3 mm in width. Echinostomiasis is endemic in Southeast Asia and the Far East, especially mainland China, Taiwan, the Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Thailand.</p><p>The life cycle is similar to that of fasciolopsiasis, with snails as the first intermediate host. However, after cercariae are released from the snail, they can encyst in the same snail or in other snails, clams, fish, or mussels, which serve as the second intermediate host (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F63922\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63922 \">figure 4</a>).

Anorexia, weight loss, anemia, and edema can also occur. In general, symptoms due to echinostomiasis are more severe than due to heterophyiasis or metagonimiasis, likely due to more severe mucosal damage. Unlike fasciolopsiasis, however, in general, echinostomiasis is not life threatening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-flukes/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis is established by finding characteristic eggs in the stool.
