Poisoning caused by ingestion of other seafood (eg, scombroid fish, shellfish, or pufferfish) is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of shellfish and pufferfish poisoning&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scombroid-histamine-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Scombroid (histamine) poisoning&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3603702\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ciguatera fish poisoning is a foodborne illness that is caused by ingestion of reef fish (eg, barracuda, amberjack, moray eel, and certain types of grouper, snapper, or parrotfish) that are contaminated with toxins that arise from <em>Gambierdiscus toxicus</em>, a single-celled organism that grows on coral reefs. Ciguatera fish poisoning accounts for approximately 20 percent of the fish-related foodborne disease outbreaks in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], and is a common fish food poisoning in tropical coastal regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Approximately 20,000 to 50,000 people develop this poisoning annually worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], although this may be an underestimate because of missed diagnoses and underreporting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In the United States, an estimated 16,000 cases occur annually, resulting in more than 300 hospitalizations but fewer than five deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Estimates of lifetime prevalence of ciguatera fish poisoning range from 7 percent in Puerto Rico [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] to 70 percent in the Polynesian Islands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Most cases originate in the tropics and subtropics, between 35 degrees north latitude and 35 degrees south latitude. However, cases of ciguatera toxicity may also occur in more temperate regions because of increasing tourism, fish exportation, and unusual fish migration. Multiple cases of ciguatera fish poisoning have also been reported after ingestion of imported fish purchased at markets in New York City [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] and in northern Germany [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], as well as fish imported to Paris from Guadeloupe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In addition, two cases of ciguatera fish poisoning have been reported following consumption of fish (barracuda) caught off the coast of South Carolina, well north of the typical location for such poisoning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>Some experts postulate that increasing seawater temperature due to climate change may increase the frequency of ciguatera fish poisoning, because the organisms that produce the toxin thrive in warmer waters and could potentially migrate to nontraditional areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, a 2013 analysis reported that the incidence of ciguatera poisoning has not increased in the US Virgin Islands over the past 30 years despite an overall increase in seawater temperatures at that site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>More than 400 different fish species have been associated with ciguatera fish toxicity. Reef-dwelling tropical fish such as barracuda, moray eel, amberjack, and certain types of grouper, mackerel, parrotfish, and red snapper are the most common sources. Rare cases exist of ciguatera fish poisoning occurring after the ingestion of temperate fish, including farm-raised salmon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In general, however, toxicity from nontropical fish is extremely rare.</p><p>The overall fatality rate from ciguatera fish poisoning is about 0.1 percent, with death usually due to cardiovascular collapse or respiratory failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/3,15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,15-18</a>]. Mortality is lowest in the Caribbean and areas of the world where the healthcare system is able to rapidly treat the rare episodes of coma, bradycardia, or hypotension.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3603709\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ciguatera fish poisoning is caused by several distinct toxins, of which ciguatoxin is the best known. These toxins are formed by dinoflagellates of the genus Gambierdiscus, which are single-celled algae-like organisms that grow on and around coral reefs. <em>Gambierdiscus toxicus</em>, which produces ciguatoxin, tends to proliferate on denuded coral surfaces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The dinoflagellates are consumed by large, predatory fish (eg, barracuda, amberjack, moray eel, snapper, and certain types of grouper) that concentrate the toxin in their organs and flesh but are not affected by it. Ciguatera toxin-containing fish do not taste, smell, or appear unusual. Cooking, marinating, freezing, and stewing fish do not destroy the toxins.</p><p>Ciguatoxin is a lipid-soluble, heat-stable, acid-resistant neurotoxin. It opens voltage-dependent sodium channels in cell membranes, triggering membrane depolarization. Ciguatoxin exposure in an animal model has caused long-term disruption of cerebral function in association with upregulation of sodium channel expression in astrocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p>Maitotoxin and scaritoxin, other ciguatera associated toxins, increase calcium ion influx through excitable membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] and permeability of sodium channels resulting in norepinephrine and acetylcholine release, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3603716\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient affected with ciguatera fish poisoning frequently develops the following constellation of clinical findings: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gastrointestinal</strong> &ndash; Gastroenteritis, including vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramping, typically begins three to six hours after eating contaminated fish, but can be delayed up to 30 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/16,17,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17,22</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neurologic</strong> &ndash; Neurologic abnormalities usually appear 3 to 72 hours after the meal. Clinical findings include peri-oral paresthesias, pruritus without urticaria or erythema, a metallic taste in the mouth, painful dentition, a feeling that the teeth are loose, painful urination, blurred vision, and temperature-related dysesthesias (cold stimuli perceived as hot or producing an abnormal, unpleasant sensation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. Temperature-related dysesthesias are regarded by some as a specific finding of ciguatera toxicity although it can also be seen in patients with neurotoxic shellfish poisoning. In the South Pacific, paresis may occur in up to 10 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Reversible cerebellar dysfunction also can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cardiovascular</strong> &ndash; Cardiovascular signs, including bradycardia, heart block, and hypotension, can occur within hours of consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p>The types and frequencies of presenting signs and symptoms vary according to locale and likely reflect geographic differences in the various toxins and local food habits (eg, ingestion of visceral or reproductive organs where the toxin is concentrated) that may increase toxin consumption (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F88891\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88891 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In Pacific and Indian Ocean regions, patients often display early neurologic, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular findings with neurologic findings predominating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Mental status changes, such as hallucinations or giddiness, and ataxia may also be noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Although infrequent, life-threatening signs including coma and respiratory distress have also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/25,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,29</a>]. </p><p>By contrast, in the Caribbean, ciguatera fish poisoning usually presents with gastroenteritis followed by a neurologic illness <strong>without</strong> mental status changes and is usually <strong>not</strong> life-threatening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/3,4,22,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,22,30,31</a>]. </p><p>A number of other clinical findings have been associated with ciguatera toxicity as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic neuropsychiatric illness with fatigue and malaise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fibromyalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Premature labor and spontaneous abortion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Painful sexual intercourse in men and women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Painful ejaculation in an affected male, followed by dyspareunia in the previously unaffected female [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]</p><p/><p>The course of ciguatera fish poisoning is variable. Gastrointestinal and, if present, cardiovascular signs frequently resolve within 24 to 48 hours and rarely persist beyond four days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/4,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,22</a>]. Neurologic abnormalities typically are more persistent, lasting from a few days to several weeks. About 20 percent of patients have neurologic signs and symptoms that persist for months; and up to 2 percent report findings, such as fatigue, weakness, headache, or depression, that last for years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/30,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,35</a>]. However, patients who continue with symptoms beyond one year warrant investigation for other potential etiologies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Several case reports and series describe exacerbation or relapse of ciguatera toxicity in patients who consume alcohol, caffeine, nuts, pork, chicken, or fish, including fish that did not cause poisoning symptoms in other individuals sharing the meal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/25,36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,36-38</a>]. In one case, a patient developed neurologic symptoms (perioral paresthesia, myalgia, and malaise) and arthralgia similar to his original ciguatera poisoning symptoms two years later after drinking one beer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Excessive physical exertion or dehydration within six months of original symptoms has also been reported to cause worsening or relapsing symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3603723\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnant and nursing mothers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perinatal transmission of ciguatera toxicity may occur. As an example, a baby born by caesarean section to a mother with ciguatera poisoning exhibited left sided facial palsy, possible hand myotonia, and respiratory distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. These symptoms resolved within six weeks. </p><p>Toxins can also be transmitted via breast milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Thus, nursing mothers with ciguatera fish poisoning should be advised to stop breast feeding while symptomatic. To maintain lactation, they can pump and discard breast milk. Though evidence is lacking, resumption of breast feeding is probably safe once the mother's symptoms have completely resolved. However, careful monitoring of the infant is warranted in such situations. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3603730\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No clinical test is available to diagnose ciguatera fish poisoning. The diagnosis is established clinically using the following criteria: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A history of ingestion of a large reef fish commonly associated with ciguatera toxicity (eg, moray eel, amberjack, barracuda, red snapper, or grouper)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrointestinal and neurologic features consistent with ciguatera fish poisoning, especially temperature-related dysesthesia (see <a href=\"#H3603716\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exclusion of other potential causes (see <a href=\"#H3603737\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confirmation of ciguatoxin in the consumed fish, if possible. If the fish is not available for analysis, ciguatera poisoning in other individuals who consumed the same fish is also supportive.</p><p/><p>Fish can be tested using a mouse bioassay and an IgG immunoassay, but these tests are costly and time consuming and are not widely used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Alternatively, cytotoxicity assays or liquid chromatography-mass spectrophotometry can be employed although these techniques are also not widely or rapidly available, other than through the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or similar government agency in other countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/22,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,40</a>].</p><p>Reporting of ciguatera poisoning is variable depending upon region. In the United States, ciguatera is a reportable condition in many states, including California, Florida, Hawaii, North Carolina, New York, Rhode Island, and South Carolina, as well as the US Virgin Islands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Regardless of region, suspected cases should be reported to public health authorities when diagnosed so that outbreaks can be identified and investigated. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3603737\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ciguatera fish poisoning has a distinct clinical presentation and is often readily identified once a careful food history is obtained. However, several other illnesses may have similar features as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ciguatera-fish-poisoning/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neurotoxic shellfish poisoning</strong> &ndash; Ingestion of shellfish contaminated by dinoflagellate species <em>Gymnodinium breve</em>, which is associated with red tides in temperate waters, can produce gastrointestinal distress and neurologic symptoms such as paresthesias of the face, mouth, and extremities, dizziness, ataxia, and muscle aches. Patients may also experience temperature-related dysesthesia and seizures. All symptoms, including neurologic toxicity, typically resolve within three days. The development of symptoms soon after ingestion of shellfish helps to differentiate neurotoxic shellfish poisoning from ciguatera poisoning. However, the diagnosis may be clouded if the patient has also ingested reef fish. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of shellfish and pufferfish poisoning&quot;, section on 'Neurotoxic shellfish poisoning'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Paralytic shellfish poisoning </strong>&ndash; Paralytic shellfish poisoning is caused by ingestion of bivalve mollusks, such as mussels, clams, scallops, and oysters, as well as crabs and snails that are contaminated with dinoflagellates of the genus <em>Alexandrium</em>. These algae are also associated with red tides in temperate waters. Physical findings occur within hours of ingestion and include neurologic symptoms ranging from perioral tingling, ataxia, difficulty swallowing, dizziness, paresthesias, weakness, paralysis, brainstem dysfunction, and respiratory failure. The rapid onset of weakness and paralysis distinguishes paralytic shellfish poisoning from ciguatera fish poisoning. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of shellfish and pufferfish poisoning&quot;, section on 'Paralytic shellfish poisoning'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pufferfish poisoning </strong>&ndash; Pufferfish poisoning results in paresthesias of the face and extremities, nausea, dizziness, weakness, loss of reflexes, paralysis, and hypotension caused by tetrodotoxin, which blocks sodium channels. This poisoning is primarily encountered in Japan where &quot;Fugu&quot; or blowfish is considered a delicacy. As with paralytic shellfish poisoning, the development of weakness and paralysis differentiates pufferfish poisoning from ciguatera fish poisoning. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-shellfish-and-pufferfish-poisoning#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of shellfish and pufferfish poisoning&quot;, section on 'Pufferfish poisoning (tetrodotoxin)'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Scombroid fish poisoning</strong> &ndash; Signs and symptoms of scombroid toxicity usually begin within an hour of eating contaminated fish. The symptoms resemble an IgE-mediated allergic reaction. The patient may suddenly experience flushing, a sensation of warmth, an erythematous rash, palpitations, and significant tachycardia. The rash often is especially prominent on the upper torso and face. Although the timing of symptoms after eating fish is similar to ciguatera toxicity, scombroid otherwise shares very few of its clinical features. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scombroid-histamine-poisoning#H1057432\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Scombroid (histamine) poisoning&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Foodborne botulism </strong>&ndash; Ingestion of preformed botulinum toxin, typically found in home canned foods, causes vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, cranial nerve dysfunction, and descending paralysis beginning hours to days after consumption. The disease presentation can vary from mild complaints to death within the first 24 hours of symptoms. Demonstration of the toxin in the blood is diagnostic. The lack of sensory changes helps to distinguish foodborne botulism from ciguatera fish poisoning. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=botulism#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Botulism&quot;, section on 'Foodborne botulism'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome </strong>&ndash; The acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy variant of Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome produces extremity paresthesias followed by ascending weakness with associated hypo- or areflexia. In some patients, the paresthesias may precede signs of weakness and suggest the diagnosis of ciguatera fish poisoning. The diagnosis of Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome is based upon the clinical features of the characteristic development of weakness. Lack of pleocytosis on examination of the cerebrospinal fluid and nerve conduction studies consistent with a demyelinating polyneuropathy provide confirmation of the clinical impression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome in adults: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome in adults: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Multiple sclerosis </strong>&ndash; Sensory symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS) can include paroxysmal onset of extremity paresthesias, pruritus dysesthesia, ataxia, fatigue, and alteration of facial sensation that may be mistaken for early signs of ciguatera toxicity. However, unlike ciguatera fish poisoning, MS causes vertigo, bowel and bladder dysfunction, transverse myelopathy, and weakness. However, clinical findings vary significantly in patients with MS and considerable overlap with neurologic symptoms of ciguatera fish poisoning may occur. The diagnosis of MS is based upon clinical findings and demonstration of demyelinating central nervous system lesions distributed over space and time. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features of multiple sclerosis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Eosinophilic meningitis</strong> &ndash; Similar to findings of ciguatera toxicity, patients with eosinophilic meningitis commonly have nausea, vomiting, and paresthesias. Paresthesias with residual areas of hyperesthesia can persist for several weeks, even after other symptoms have resolved. However, unlike ciguatera fish poisoning, these patients typically have suggestive features of meningitis including neck stiffness and excruciating headache, which is usually frontal, occipital, or bitemporal. The diagnosis of eosinophilic meningitis is made based upon clinical presentation and cerebral spinal fluid eosinophilia, defined as the presence of more than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">eosinophils/mm&sup3;</span> in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> eosinophils accounting for more than 10 percent of CSF leukocytes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eosinophilic-meningitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eosinophilic meningitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Organophosphate poisoning</strong> &ndash; Organophosphate poisoning has some features in common with ciguatera toxicity including vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. It can also uncommonly cause delayed neurotoxicity consisting of &quot;stocking-glove&quot; paresthesias and ascending flaccid weakness after acute toxicity has resolved. However, unlike ciguatera fish poisoning, organophosphate toxicity also has additional cholinergic findings of salivation, bronchorrhea, and bronchospasm with accompanying nicotinic features of muscle fasciculations, weakness, and paralysis. Lack of anticholinergic response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a> challenge and decreased red blood cell acetylcholinesterase activity support the clinical diagnosis of organophosphate poisoning. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=organophosphate-and-carbamate-poisoning#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Organophosphate and carbamate poisoning&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=organophosphate-and-carbamate-poisoning#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Organophosphate and carbamate poisoning&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.) </p><p/><p>In addition to the above diagnoses, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also known as systemic exertion intolerance disease (SEID), or depression may develop as comorbidities after ciguatera fish poisoning.

These toxins are concentrated in the organs and flesh of large, predatory reef fish (eg, moray eel, amberjack, barracuda, red snapper, or grouper). Ciguatera toxin-containing fish do not taste, smell, or appear unusual. Cooking, marinating, freezing, and stewing fish do not destroy the toxins. (See <a href=\"#H3603709\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although signs and symptoms vary according to locale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F88891\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88891 \">table 1</a>), the patient affected with ciguatera fish poisoning frequently develops the following constellation of clinical findings (see <a href=\"#H3603716\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Gastrointestinal</strong> &ndash; Gastroenteritis, including vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramping.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Neurologic &ndash; </strong>Neurologic abnormalities include peri-oral paresthesias, a metallic taste in the mouth, painful dentition, a feeling that the teeth are loose, painful urination, blurred vision, and temperature-related dysesthesias (cold stimuli perceived as hot or producing an abnormal, unpleasant sensation). Temperature-related dysesthesias are regarded as a specific finding of ciguatera toxicity. In the South Pacific, paralysis may occur in up to 10 percent of patients. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Cardiovascular</strong> &ndash; Less commonly bradycardia, heart block, and hypotension may occur.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The course of ciguatera fish poisoning is variable. Gastrointestinal and, if present, cardiovascular signs frequently resolve within 24 to 48 hours and rarely persist beyond four days. Neurologic abnormalities typically are more persistent, lasting from a few days to several weeks. Ingestion of alcohol, caffeine, nuts, or fish as well as excessive physical exertion can cause exacerbation or recurrence of ciguatera toxicity.
