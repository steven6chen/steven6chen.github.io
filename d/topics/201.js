It is characterized by small-vessel platelet-rich thrombi, thrombocytopenia, and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA). In addition, some patients may have neurologic abnormalities, mild renal insufficiency, or low-grade fever.</p><p>The use of plasma exchange (PEX) therapy since the early 1990s has converted TTP from an almost uniformly fatal condition to a treatable disease. However, some patients with TTP will have a transient, incomplete, or no response to treatment with PEX, glucocorticoids, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> (ie, refractory disease), and some will have another episode of TTP after initial recovery (ie, relapse).

Questioning may reveal a previous temporal relationship with a specific drug that may not have been appreciated at the time. One dramatic example in our experience was a woman with recurrent acute episodes of thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and fever during treatment for suspected TTP. Sepsis due to the central venous catheter was suspected repeatedly; only later did we learn that she had quinine-induced TMA and her husband was giving her quinine tablets in the hospital to relieve her leg cramps.

This is because the results of ADAMTS13 activity testing are not available immediately, and clinical assessment based on symptoms and platelet count are the most relevant information for decision making.</p><p>However, if the initial diagnosis of acquired TTP was supported by the presence of severe ADAMTS13 deficiency (ie, activity &lt;10 percent) and the presence of an inhibitor, and facilities for prompt measurements are available, a repeat ADAMTS13 activity measurement may be helpful, particularly in patients with persistent or recurrent thrombocytopenia whose diagnosis is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-treatment-of-refractory-or-relapsed-disease/abstract/4,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,14,15</a>]. The continued presence of severe ADAMTS13 deficiency is consistent with continued activity of TTP as the cause of persistent or recurrent thrombocytopenia. Conversely, non-severely deficient ADAMTS13 activity (ie, activity &gt;10 percent) in a patient who has not received very recent PEX therapy is suggestive of an alternative process.</p><p>Monitoring of ADAMTS13 activity in remission, when there is not urgent time pressure to act on the results, is discussed in detail separately.

Although the practice of using more aggressive PEX appeared to be effective in some patients and we used it in the past, our increased use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> in the setting of refractory and severe initial disease appears to have made this unnecessary, and we no longer use this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-treatment-of-refractory-or-relapsed-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H326602\"><span class=\"h2\">High-dose glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with refractory TTP that does not respond to daily PEX and glucocorticoids or who have an exacerbation after PEX is stopped, we suggest increasing the dose of glucocorticoid to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> (ie, Solu Medrol) 1 gram intravenously per day for three days. This is generally well tolerated, and side effects are acceptable considering the gravity of the disease.

Exceptions may include an individual who is unable to tolerate rituximab or for whom there are concerns about rituximab use (eg, known hepatitis B infection), for whom a different immunosuppressive agent may be used.

However, there are potential risks associated with rituximab, including infusion reactions, mucocutaneous reactions, prolonged immunosuppression, hepatitis B reactivation, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which is very rare. Our practice is not to place patients on antimicrobial prophylaxis, with the exception of patients with a history of hepatitis B virus infection, in whom antiviral therapy may be indicated.

The options for preventive care include close observation with early intervention at the first sign of relapse, serial ADAMTS13 measurements with prophylactic administration of rituximab for a decrease in ADAMTS13 activity, maintenance rituximab independent of ADAMTS13 activity, other immunosuppressive therapies, or splenectomy. Evidence to support these options and our approaches to deciding which approach to use are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-ttp-management-following-recovery-from-an-acute-episode-and-during-remission\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired TTP: Management following recovery from an acute episode and during remission&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For individuals with multiple relapses, several reports have described the use of splenectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-treatment-of-refractory-or-relapsed-disease/abstract/50-52,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52,55</a>]. All of these describe success in preventing or decreasing the frequency of subsequent relapses. The rationale for this is the identification of ADAMTS13-specific memory B cells in the spleens of two patients with acquired TTP who underwent splenectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-treatment-of-refractory-or-relapsed-disease/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Cultured cells from both spleens produced anti-ADAMTS13 immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibodies that shared common complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). These findings were interpreted as suggesting that splenic B cells have a limited repertoire against ADAMTS13 and that these cells are critical in producing the ADAMTS13 inhibitor in acquired TTP. Following splenectomy, both patients have been free of relapse with normal ADAMTS13 activity for 8 and 11 years.</p><p>Splenectomy carries risks of infections, especially with encapsulated organisms, as well as thrombosis and perioperative risks. Surgical expertise is critical, and laparoscopic procedures appear to be associated with lower risks of adverse events. Patients should be educated regarding these risks and their mitigation, and appropriate immunizations should be provided before the procedure, as discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-splenomegaly-and-other-splenic-disorders#H6170429\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with splenomegaly and other splenic disorders&quot;, section on 'Splenectomy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of sepsis in the asplenic patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4074447769\"><span class=\"h2\">Prognosis after relapse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mortality of relapsed TTP is less than with the initial episode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-treatment-of-refractory-or-relapsed-disease/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. Potential reasons for this include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients whose disease relapses have by definition had a disease remission in response to initial therapy, so it is likely that their disease will respond to therapy again.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have had a previous episode of TTP are familiar with the presenting symptoms and therefore do not delay in contacting their clinician.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is less (or no) uncertainty about making the diagnosis and initiating therapy.</p><p/><p>However, individuals with TTP are at risk for long-term complications including heart disease, kidney disease, hypertension, cognitive decline, and depression. Thus, they require lifelong monitoring for these complications and appropriate treatment as indicated.

We define relapsed TTP as recurrence of an acute episode, manifested by thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), in a patient who had a disease remission (normal platelet count for 30 days after stopping PEX) following an episode of TTP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F101761\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101761 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H19009592\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of refractory disease should be evaluated thoroughly, so as not to miss another cause of worsening symptoms or laboratory findings. A common occurrence is sepsis related to the central venous catheter.

For patients with refractory TTP despite ongoing daily PEX, we suggest not increasing the frequency or intensity of PEX (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H326596\" class=\"local\">'Plasma exchange'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest an intensified glucocorticoid regimen, using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> (eg, Solu Medrol) 1 gram intravenously, daily for three days (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).

Our approach is individualized and takes into account the disease severity, the presence of a partial response, and local expertise. For patients whose disease is not critical, we often do not add more aggressive therapies. For patients with more concerning findings, additional therapies in approximate order of preference include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a>, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and splenectomy.
