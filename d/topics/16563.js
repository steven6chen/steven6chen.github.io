Both ultraviolet B (UVB; 280 to 320 nm) and ultraviolet A (UVA; 320 to 400 nm) can cause sunburn, but the wavelengths that are the most effective at inducing erythema are in the UVB range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sunburn/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. </p><p>Sunburn is a self-limited condition. The acute manifestations usually resolve in three to seven days. However, susceptibility to sunburn is a marker of genetic susceptibility to skin cancer and is associated with an increased risk of melanoma at all ages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sunburn/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. It is very important that clinicians counsel patients with increased susceptibility to sunburn about sun protection.</p><p>This topic will discuss the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and management of sunburn. Photosensitivity, photoprotection, and photosensitivity disorders are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cutaneous-photosensitivity-photobiology-patient-evaluation-and-photoprotection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cutaneous photosensitivity: Photobiology, patient evaluation, and photoprotection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selection-of-sunscreen-and-sun-protective-measures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selection of sunscreen and sun-protective measures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=photosensitivity-disorders-photodermatoses-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Photosensitivity disorders (photodermatoses): Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3400008\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sunburn is common. In the United States, the estimated sunburn prevalence among all adults was approximately 34 percent in 2004 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sunburn/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Prevalences ranging from 20 to 70 percent have been reported in cross-sectional studies in Europe and Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sunburn/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>].</p><p>Sunburn occurs more frequently among adolescents and young adults. In nation-wide surveys in the United States, approximately 70 percent of adolescents aged 11 to 18 years and 50 percent of adults aged 18 to 29 years reported at least one sunburn in the previous year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sunburn/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>The risk of sunburn is inversely related to latitude and is therefore greatest near the equator, where ultraviolet B (UVB) intensity is highest. The time of day is also important and sunburn is more likely to occur at noon than earlier or later in the day. Cloud cover when the sun is high offers some protection, but significant quantities of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) still reach the earth's surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sunburn/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Additional factors that increase the risk of sunburn include altitude and reflection from snow (approximately 90 percent), sand (15 to 30 percent), and water (5 to 20 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sunburn/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. There is also evidence that wet skin is more susceptible to erythema than dry skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sunburn/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>Excessive consumption of alcohol may be a risk factor for sunburn [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sunburn/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. In a study of beachgoers in Texas, participants reporting alcohol drinking on the beach had a greater body surface area with sunburn and blisters than nondrinkers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sunburn/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11503623\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5000930\"><span class=\"h2\">Individual susceptibility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The susceptibility to sunburn is highly variable among individuals. Phenotypic characteristics that confer high susceptibility to sunburn include fair skin, blue eyes, and red or blond hair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sunburn/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. An increased susceptibility to sunburn is also a marker of increased risk of melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sunburn/abstract/3,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,19,20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for the development of melanoma&quot;, section on 'Ultraviolet radiation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-basal-cell-carcinoma#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical features of basal cell carcinoma&quot;, section on 'UV radiation'</a>.)</p><p>An individual's susceptibility to sunburn can be assessed by determining the minimum erythema dose (MED), which is the lowest dose of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) delivered to the skin that produces a clearly marginated erythema in the irradiated site 24 hours after a single exposure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F88081\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef88081 \">picture 1D</a>). The MED is considered the threshold for sunburn and is widely used as a dose unit in phototherapy, experimental photobiology, and for the determination of a sunscreen's sun protection factor. </p><p>In clinical practice, the self-reported tendency to develop sunburn or tanning after sun exposure is used to determine an individual's skin phototype (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60541\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60541 \">table 1</a>). Darker skin types (IV to VI) typically require higher doses of UVR to develop a visible erythema. On average, the MED of a skin type IV that tans well is about twice the MED of a skin type I that does not tan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sunburn/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, there is considerable overlap of MED values between different skin types. Individuals with skin types I and II may develop a sunburn with daily repeated suberythemal exposures (eg, 0.5 MED) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sunburn/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5002232\"><span class=\"h2\">Action spectra</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An action spectrum indicates which wavelengths most effectively produce a skin response and usually corresponds to the absorption spectrum for the chromophore (molecule that absorbs UVR photons) that initiates the response. The action spectrum for erythema indicates that the most effective wavelengths present in sunlight are in the ultraviolet B (UVB) range. Ultraviolet A (UVA) also can cause erythema, but doses nearly 1000 times higher than UVB are required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sunburn/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. </p><p>The sun is primarily a UVA source, with UVB representing only a maximum of approximately 5 percent of the UVR reaching the earth's surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sunburn/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]; however, this contributes to over 80 percent of the erythemally effective energy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sunburn/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Thus, the risk of sunburn is highest when the UVB to UVA ratio is high, as occurs between 11 AM and 3 PM in the summer months in temperate climates and particularly at latitudes approaching the equator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sunburn/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2456151\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism of ultraviolet B-induced inflammation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the sunburn response, many biochemical and cellular changes occur in the epidermis and dermis before the erythema becomes evident. However, the initiating events are incompletely understood and the nature of the chromophore(s) for erythema is still uncertain. The observation that the action spectrum for erythema is very similar to that for the induction of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) suggests that DNA photodamage may be the trigger of the inflammatory cascade in sunburn [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sunburn/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. UVB-mediated pigmentation (delayed tanning) can also be triggered by CPD, suggesting that inflammation and sunburn are also important in the tanning response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sunburn/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Early events include vasodilation and increased blood flow, endothelial cell activation, formation of &quot;sunburn cells&quot; (ie, keratinocytes undergoing p53-dependent apoptosis), and release of inflammatory mediators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sunburn/abstract/26-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-30</a>]. Vasodilation of dermal small blood vessels and edema of endothelial cells occur within 30 minutes of sun exposure and peak at 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sunburn/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Dyskeratotic &quot;sunburn cells&quot; may appear in the epidermis within hours of exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sunburn/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Erythema becomes clinically apparent 3 to 6 hours after exposure, reaches a peak at 12 to 24 hours, and usually subsides at 72 hours. Neutrophilic infiltration starts approximately three hours after UVB exposure, peaks at 24 hours, and continues up to 48 hours later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sunburn/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. </p><p>Prostaglandins and nitric oxide (NO) appear to be the major mediators of UVB-induced inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sunburn/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Numerous proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory eicosanoids have been identified in suction blister fluid over a 72-hour period after UVB exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sunburn/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Vasodilatory prostaglandins (PG) PGE2, PGF2a, and PGE3 appear in the first 24 to 48 hours and are associated with increased COX-2 expression at 24 hours. Chemoattractant prostaglandins (11-, 12-, and 8-monohydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid [HETE]) appear at 4 to 72 hours, whereas the anti-inflammatory 15-HETE is maximally present at 72 hours.</p><p>Several proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8, are elevated after UVB exposure. Cytokines may play several roles in UVB-induced inflammation, including activation of transcription factors, upregulation of endothelial adhesion molecules, and recruitment of neutrophils to the skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sunburn/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16500253\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOPATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The extent and time course of the histological changes observed after ultraviolet B (UVB) exposure varies with the magnitude of the exposure dose. Epidermal changes include spongiosis, parakeratosis, and &quot;sunburn cells&quot; (apoptotic keratinocytes with condensed nuclear chromatin and eosinophilic cytoplasm). Sunburn cells may be present in the epidermis within hours of exposure and increase in number over the following 24 hours and form a band at the stratum corneum at 72 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sunburn/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Dermal changes include endothelial cell swelling, perivenular edema, and presence of degranulated mast cells. A perivascular infiltrate of neutrophils appears shortly after the exposure and peaks at about 14 hours. A later mononuclear infiltrate persists for at least 48 hours.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11503630\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical manifestations of sunburn range from mild erythema to highly painful erythema with edema, vesiculation, and blistering (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F73224%7EDERM%2F59991%7EDERM%2F52112%7EDERM%2F88081\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73224 graphicRef59991 graphicRef52112 graphicRef88081 \">picture 1A-D</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F61540\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61540 \">table 2</a>).

Sunscreens should be applied 15 to 30 minutes before sun exposure to allow the formation of a protective film on the skin and reapplied at least every two hours. Because all sunscreens are washed off upon swimming or sweating, reapplication after swimming is needed even for sunscreen products labeled in Europe as &quot;water resistant&quot; (retains at least 50 percent of the labeled SPF after two 20-minute periods in water) or &quot;very water resistant&quot; (retains 50 percent of the labeled SPF after four 20-minute periods in water) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sunburn/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In the United States, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires the SPF to remain the same before and after water immersion, with the terms &quot;water resistant&quot; and &quot;very water resistant&quot; meaning that the SPF is maintained after 40 or 80 minutes of activity in water or sweating, respectively. Sunscreens provide a demonstrated reduction in sun damage, squamous cell carcinomas, melanomas, and photoaging, if used appropriately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sunburn/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

Both ultraviolet B (UVB) and ultraviolet A (UVA) can cause sunburn; however, the wavelengths that are most effective in inducing erythema are in the UVB range (290 to 320 nm). (See <a href=\"#H11503609\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5002232\" class=\"local\">'Action spectra'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical manifestations of sunburn include painful erythema with or without edema, vesiculation, and blistering (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F73224%7EDERM%2F59991%7EDERM%2F52112%7EDERM%2F88081\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73224 graphicRef59991 graphicRef52112 graphicRef88081 \">picture 1A-D</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F61540\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61540 \">table 2</a>).
