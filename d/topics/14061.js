In most of these cases, labor and delivery results in good outcomes in the absence of <span class=\"nowrap\">physician/midwife</span> intervention or a traditional delivery site. </p><p>This topic will review the key points for assisting women during an imminent delivery of a fetus in cephalic presentation. It is intended for health care providers who do not perform obstetrical deliveries as part of their usual practice.

Precipitous delivery is generally thought to result from abnormally low resistance of the birth canal, abnormally strong uterine contractions, lack of awareness of painful contractions, or some combination of these [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/precipitous-birth-not-occurring-on-a-labor-and-delivery-unit/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">IMAGES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The birth process is illustrated in the diagrams (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71178\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71178 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65965\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65965 \">figure 2</a>) and photographs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F51141%7EOBGYN%2F64939%7EOBGYN%2F76754%7EOBGYN%2F57824%7EOBGYN%2F65504%7EOBGYN%2F75270\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51141 graphicRef64939 graphicRef76754 graphicRef57824 graphicRef65504 graphicRef75270 \">picture 1A-F</a>). In addition, the key points for a precipitous delivery are presented in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70178\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70178 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Several videos that show how to deliver a baby are available for free online.

Of note, this video includes use of episiotomy, which is no longer routinely performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSMENT AND PREPARATION</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Call for help</strong> &ndash; There are two patients in an obstetrical delivery: the mother and the infant; ideally each should have at least one health care provider. An obstetrician or midwife and pediatrician or family practitioner should be summoned, if available.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rapid obstetric assessment</strong> &ndash; Quickly assess the woman's delivery history, medical history, and gestational age. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Gravidity and parity</strong> &ndash; Gravidity refers to the number of prior pregnancies while parity refers to the outcomes of those pregnancies, including deliveries, miscarriage, and stillbirth. Women who have had a prior vaginal delivery or have had a prior precipitous delivery tend to have more rapid labors than women who have not had a prior delivery. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Gestational age</strong> &ndash; Most women, and their partners, will know their estimated due date (EDD) and the current gestational age of the pregnancy. If only the EDD is known, the current gestational age can be calculated (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-gestational-age-from-estimated-date-of-delivery-edd\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). If only the date of the last menstrual cycle is available, the EDD and current gestational age can be calculated (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-estimated-date-of-delivery-edd\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">For those who do not know the due date or are unable to communicate (eg, intoxicated), the top of the uterine fundus is palpated. After 20 weeks of gestation, measuring the distance from the symphysis pubis to the top of the uterus (fundus) in centimeters crudely corresponds with the week of gestation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F115429\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115429 \">figure 3</a>). Leiomyoma, multiple gestation, and other factors affecting uterine size (eg, abnormal amniotic fluid volume), and inability to palpate the uterus (obesity), reduce the diagnostic performance of physical examination-based gestational age assessment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-assessment-of-gestational-age-date-of-delivery-and-fetal-weight\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal assessment of gestational age, date of delivery, and fetal weight&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Gestational age impacts the type of pediatric care that may be required. A delivery before 37 weeks of gestation is considered preterm; these newborns are at increased risk of morbidity, particularly respiratory problems and difficulty maintaining their temperature. Most preterm infants born &ge;26 and &lt;37 weeks have a high likelihood of survival, while virtually no infant born &lt;22 weeks will survive. From 22 to 25 weeks of gestation, mortality rapidly increases with each week of gestation, and morbidity decreases as long as appropriate neonatal care is available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=short-term-complications-of-the-preterm-infant\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Short-term complications of the preterm infant&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=periviable-birth-limit-of-viability\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Periviable birth (Limit of viability)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Obstetrical or medical problems</strong> &ndash; Ask about obstetric issues, such as twin gestation, preterm fetus, previous cesarean delivery, fetal anomalies, maternal bleeding diathesis or other medical conditions that may complicate delivery, the immediate maternal postpartum course, or immediate newborn care. For example, women with a previous cesarean delivery are at risk for uterine rupture during labor and women with a bleeding diathesis are at risk for postpartum hemorrhage, both of which can be life-threatening complications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Women with signs of preeclampsia (hypertension, defined as systolic blood pressure &ge;140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &ge;90 mmHg, and proteinuria or hypertension and headache, scotomata, or epigastric pain with or without proteinuria) are at risk of eclampsia (seizure), which should be prevented by administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium sulfate</a> intravenously or intramuscularly. If magnesium sulfate is not available, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a> 1000 mg loading dose infused intravenously over one hour is an alternative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/precipitous-birth-not-occurring-on-a-labor-and-delivery-unit/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. If neither drug is available, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> are used to treat a seizure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-management-and-prognosis#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Management and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Seizure prophylaxis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Rupture of membranes</strong> &ndash; Determine if and when her &quot;bag of waters&quot; or amniotic membranes ruptured. Increasing length of rupture of membranes increases the risk of intrauterine infection. While this information may not change the immediate care at the time of a precipitous delivery, the information will be important for the clinicians who assume care of the mother and baby. For example, rupture of membranes for &ge;18 hours before delivery is a risk factor for early onset&nbsp;Group B&nbsp;<em>Streptococcus </em>infection in the newborn. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=group-b-streptococcal-infection-in-neonates-and-young-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Group B streptococcal infection in neonates and young infants&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Physical examination</strong> &ndash; A brief history and pelvic examination is performed to determine the presenting part and whether delivery is imminent. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Is the woman voluntarily pushing with her contractions? If so, she is more likely in the second stage of labor (cervix fully dilated) and about to deliver. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-and-abnormal-labor-progression#H30701237\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal and abnormal labor progression&quot;, section on 'Stages and phases'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Is the fetus visible and beginning to emerge from the vagina (ie, crowning) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F51141\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51141 \">picture 1A</a>)? If so, delivery is imminent, particularly if the fetus is visible when the woman is not pushing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">If the fetus is not visible, imminent delivery is still likely if she wants to bear <span class=\"nowrap\">down/push</span> or states she &quot;can feel the baby coming.&quot; and the perineum distends with contractions. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">The median second stage of labor (time from full cervical dilation to delivery) is about 30 minutes in nulliparous women and 12 minutes in multiparous women. If contractions are more than two minutes apart, there may be time to transport the mother to Labor and Delivery or to the nearest emergency department for delivery under more controlled conditions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>What is the presenting part? On transvaginal examination at full dilation, the hard rounded skull of a cephalic presentation can be distinguished from the soft irregular buttocks (and sometimes feet) of the breech presentation. The anal orifice is often also palpable with breech presentation. If ultrasound is available, presentation can be confirmed, if uncertain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">If a fluid-filled amniotic sac is visible, leave it alone until it ruptures naturally. If a foot is visible, do not pull on it. Vaginal breech delivery is presented in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=delivery-of-the-fetus-in-breech-presentation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Delivery of the fetus in breech presentation&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prepare the woman and immediate area for delivery</strong> &ndash; Remove any wet or severely soiled clothing. Adequate lighting is helpful. Ideally, clean absorbent materials are placed under the mother to collect blood and body fluids eliminated during the birth process. Clean gloves should be worn, if available.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Utilize available equipment</strong> &ndash; If there is time and the equipment is available, maternal temperature and blood pressure should be checked. Fever suggests intra-amniotic infection. Maternal hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure &ge;140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &ge;90 mmHg) is the key finding for preeclampsia. Preeclampsia can progress to eclampsia (ie, seizures) and can be associated with life-threatening complications (eg, hepatic rupture, pulmonary edema, stroke, renal failure) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79977%7EOBGYN%2F76975\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79977 graphicRef76975 \">table 2A-B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-management-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Management and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eclampsia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eclampsia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrapartum-fever\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrapartum fever&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The fetal heart rate can be checked with a Doppler device, by auscultation with stethoscope, or with use of a portable ultrasound unit, if available. A normal fetal heart rate is between 110 and 160 beats per minute. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrapartum fetal heart rate assessment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Position the mother for delivery</strong> &ndash; Position the mother in a semi-sitting position, with hips flexed and abducted, and knees flexed (lithotomy position) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F73352\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73352 \">figure 4</a>). In the absence of a birthing bed or table with stirrups, it is easier to deliver a baby if pillows, a stack of towels, or an upside-down bedpan is placed under the mother's hips and back to raise the perineum above the surface of the <span class=\"nowrap\">bed/stretcher</span>. This provides additional room to maneuver when guiding the infant posteriorly to ease <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> shoulder under the symphysis pubis. Alternatively, the mother may lie on her side with her leg held up by a support person (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F55925\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55925 \">figure 5</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For offsite deliveries, readily available materials can be used to aid a delivery. </p><p>If available, the following supplies make up a standard delivery kit:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibacterial cleansers to wash your hands and the mother's perineum</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gauze sponges</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sterile gloves and gowns</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clean cloth or gauze sponges to wipe infant's nose and mouth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two sterile clamps to clamp the umbilical cord</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sterile scissors or knife to cut the umbilical cord between the clamps</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A red-top tube to collect fetal blood from the placental end of the cut umbilical cord</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clean towels, sheets, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> blankets to dry and swaddle the infant</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blankets to keep the mother warm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suitable containers for the placenta and wet, bloody clothing and sheets</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A diaper</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PROCEDURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The key points for performing an emergent birth are presented in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70178\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70178 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Intravenous access</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If available, we insert a large bore intravenous catheter (14 or 16 gauge) into an arm vein and draw a blood sample for blood type and antibody screen.

We ask her to pant through the peak of her contractions and try to rest and breathe normally between them. This helps to keep her from bearing down and delivering before additional help is available. </p><p>If the fetal head is crowning, delivery is imminent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F51141\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51141 \">picture 1A</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F64939\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64939 \">picture 1B</a>). The goal is to control, not restrain, fetal expulsion. We ask her to pant or make only modest expulsive efforts in an attempt to achieve a controlled delivery (ie, gradual expulsion of the fetus), which is less likely to cause maternal or fetal trauma than an uncontrolled delivery. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Controlling and guiding the delivery'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Controlling and guiding the delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal is to prevent the fetal head from descending rapidly and tearing through the maternal introitus and perineum. The movement of the fetus through and out of the vagina are presented in the image (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71178\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71178 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Episiotomy is not performed routinely.&nbsp;It is performed in about 10 percent of deliveries in the US [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/precipitous-birth-not-occurring-on-a-labor-and-delivery-unit/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>], when the clinician believes enlarging the birth outlet to facilitate delivery of the fetus will benefit the mother or baby and warrants maternal exposure to the potential adverse outcomes associated with the procedure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-episiotomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to episiotomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Delivery of the head</strong> &ndash; One option is to place one hand on the crowning portion of the fetal head and apply light pressure to maintain the head in a flexed position (ie, hands-on approach). Use the other hand to ease the perineum over the fetal face (the most common fetal position at expulsion is facing the mother's back) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F64939\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64939 \">picture 1B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76754\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76754 \">picture 1C</a>). Do not pull on the head; let the mother gradually push it into your hands. Her strong urge to bear down will abate somewhat when the head is out. If the membranes still cover the baby's head, use a clamp, fingers, or forceps to rupture them.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An alternative approach is to avoid touching the perineum or fetus until the head is born (ie, hands-off approach). Neither approach has been proven to be superior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/precipitous-birth-not-occurring-on-a-labor-and-delivery-unit/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Restitution of the head</strong> &ndash; After the infant's head has delivered, it will usually rotate to the side (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57824\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57824 \">picture 1D</a>). Feel for a loop of umbilical cord around the baby's neck. If present, gently slip it over the head. If it resists, either doubly clamp and cut the cord or leave it alone; it is important not to rupture or avulse the cord because serious <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/neonatal</span> bleeding can occur.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Delivery of the shoulders</strong> &ndash; With the next push, guide the head slightly downward so that the anterior shoulder slips under the symphysis pubis and delivers, then guide the head slightly upward to deliver the posterior shoulder over, rather than through, the perineum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65504\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65504 \">picture 1E</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If the shoulders do not deliver easily, have your assistant or the mother sharply flex her thighs back against her abdomen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F74910\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74910 \">figure 6</a>); this opens the pelvis to its maximum dimension. Ask her to push again. Do not pull on the head in an attempt to extract the baby if it does not slide out of the vagina easily. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=shoulder-dystocia-intrapartum-diagnosis-management-and-outcome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Shoulder dystocia: Intrapartum diagnosis, management, and outcome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Delivery of the body</strong> &ndash; Once both shoulders have delivered, the rest of the baby usually immediately follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F75270\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75270 \">picture 1F</a>). Document the time of expulsion. Use your hands to hold onto the back of the head and buttocks of the baby securely as it delivers. The baby can then be cradled against your body, with the back of its head in your cupped hand and its body supported by your forearm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As soon as possible, place the baby on the mother's chest or upper abdomen (skin to skin) where she can cradle it and keep it warm. The infant can be wiped down while being held by the mother. In the absence of uterotonic agents, rapidly initiating breastfeeding helps to contract the uterus and decrease bleeding. The cord is not <span class=\"nowrap\">clamped/cut</span> yet. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Clamping and cutting the umbilical cord'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Newborn care and assessment</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Protect the airway</strong> &ndash; The newborn's neck is held in a neutral to slightly extended position to open the airway. The nose and mouth are wiped of blood and mucus with a clean cloth. There is no strong evidence that routine suctioning with a bulb or catheter is beneficial. However, if the infant appears to have an airway obstruction, use a bulb to gently suction the mouth first (avoid the posterior pharynx) and then the nose; newborns are obligate nose breathers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/precipitous-birth-not-occurring-on-a-labor-and-delivery-unit/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The mouth is cleared first to so its contents are not aspirated if the newborn gasps when the nose is suctioned. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-normal-labor-and-delivery#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of normal labor and delivery&quot;, section on 'Delivery of the newborn'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dry</strong> &ndash; Drying the newborn promptly is crucial, as it significantly reduces heat loss. Maintaining body heat is an important initial step in caring for the newborn because hypothermia in the immediate newborn period increases oxygen consumption and metabolic demands and is independently associated with increased mortality. Low birth weight and preterm infants are particularly prone to rapid loss of body heat because of their large body surface area relative to their mass, thin skin, and decreased subcutaneous fat. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If skin-to skin contact with the mother is not possible, additional ways to keep the infant warm after drying include swaddling in warm <span class=\"nowrap\">towels/blankets,</span> performing skin-to-skin contact with a support person, placing in a warm (36.5&ordm;C) isolette, raising the environmental (room) temperature, and providing clothing. While the baby is being dried, clamping of the cord is delayed, as discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Clamping and cutting the umbilical cord'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Stimulate</strong> &ndash; Drying the infant generally provides adequate stimulation. If the baby is limp and not breathing, tactile stimulation should be initiated promptly. Appropriate ways of providing this additional stimulation include rubbing the infant's back or chest or flicking the soles of the feet with your fingers. More vigorous stimulation is not helpful and may cause injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Assess Apgar score</strong> &ndash; If possible, Apgar scores are recorded at one and five minutes after birth. The Apgar score assesses neonatal heart rate, respiratory effort, muscle tone, reflex irritability, and color. Up to two points are assigned for each variable (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-apgar-score\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 3</a>). About 90 percent of neonates have Apgar scores of 7 to 10, and generally require no special intervention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-routine-management-of-the-healthy-newborn-infant\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the routine management of the healthy newborn infant&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If the infant is not breathing or crying <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> has poor muscle tone, the initial steps in resuscitation are to dry, provide warmth, clear&nbsp;the airway, and stimulate, as described above. The next steps are to <span class=\"nowrap\">ventilate/oxygenate</span> and initiate chest compressions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-resuscitation-in-the-delivery-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal resuscitation in the delivery room&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Clamping and cutting the umbilical cord</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no urgency to clamping the umbilical cord and it should not be clamped for a minimum of 30 to 60 seconds after birth to facilitate the fetal to neonatal transition and increase infant iron stores. For preterm infants, clamping results in reduced hospital mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/precipitous-birth-not-occurring-on-a-labor-and-delivery-unit/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>If sterile instruments are available, doubly clamp the cord about four inches from the baby and cut the cord between the clamps with scissors or a knife. There are no nerve endings in the umbilical cord; cutting it is painless. If sterile instruments or tape for <span class=\"nowrap\">clamping/tying</span> and cutting the cord are not available, the cord can be left connecting the baby to the placenta. A cool room temperature (compared to body temperature) causes the Wharton's jelly to swell and blood vessels in the cord to collapse and constrict, creating a natural clamp. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-normal-labor-and-delivery#H30\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of normal labor and delivery&quot;, section on 'Cord clamping'</a>.)</p><p>Once the cord is clamped, collect one red-top tube of blood from the placental end of the cord; this blood is used for determining the newborn's blood type and Rh(D) status.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Delivery of the placenta</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Do not pull excessively on the cord to deliver the placenta, which may still be attached to the uterus. The three classic signs indicating placental separation from the uterine wall are (1) lengthening of the umbilical cord out of the vagina, (2) a gush of blood from the vagina, signifying separation of the placenta from the uterine wall, and (3) change in the shape of the uterine fundus from discoid to globular with elevation of the fundal height.</p><p>Placental separation occurs naturally, usually within five minutes of expulsion of the infant; there is no reason to try to hasten this process. Waiting 30 to 60 minutes after delivery is reasonable if bleeding is not profuse. </p><p>Contractions typically diminish after delivery of the baby, and then resume upon separation of the placenta. If the placenta is not expelled within approximately five minutes, ask the mother to bear down and gently tug on the umbilical cord to deliver it while simultaneously applying counterpressure on her uterus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/precipitous-birth-not-occurring-on-a-labor-and-delivery-unit/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Firm pressure should be placed on the mother's abdomen, just above her pubic symphysis, to secure the uterine fundus and prevent uterine inversion (uterus turns inside out). When the placenta protrudes from the introitus, grasp and gently rotate it to extract the placenta with the attached membranes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=puerperal-uterine-inversion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Puerperal uterine inversion&quot;</a>.)</p><p>After placental expulsion, a uterotonic drug is administered to stimulate the uterus to contract and remain contracted, which will reduce maternal blood loss. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Oxytocin</a> is infused (eg, 20 units in 500 mL crystalloid over one hour) into a maternal vein. Bolus intravenous injection is less safe, even at low doses. If there is no venous access, intramuscular injection (usually 10 units) is effective. If oxytocin is not available, vigorously massage the uterine fundus (which will be at the level of the maternal umbilicus) to help it contract into a firm (like a contracted biceps) globular mass. A flabby fundus suggests atony, which is the most common cause of postpartum hemorrhage. Also attempt to initiate breastfeeding to stimulate uterine contractions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-third-stage-of-labor-drug-therapy-to-minimize-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the third stage of labor: Drug therapy to minimize hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Place the placenta in a bag or suitable receptacle for later examination.

Superficial lacerations generally do not require any treatment. Deeper lacerations should be evaluated and treated by an obstetrician. Until the appropriate care providers and setting are available to repair lacerations, we advise the clinician apply pressure to lacerations that are bleeding briskly until these lacerations can be repaired. Alternately, the laceration site can be firmly packed if sterile dressing material is available.
