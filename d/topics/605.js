Doctors use 2 main types of allergy skin tests. The most common is called a skin prick test. The doctor puts a drop of the substance you might be allergic to on your skin and makes a tiny prick through the drop into your skin. He or she then watches your skin to see if the skin around the prick turns red and bumpy. If that happens, it usually means you are allergic to the substance.</p><p>If your skin does <strong>not</strong> turn red and bumpy, your doctor might still think you could be allergic to the substance. If that happens, he or she might inject a tiny amount of the substance under your skin. This is called an &quot;intradermal&quot; test. Intradermal tests are slightly better at showing an allergy because more of the test substance gets into the skin. Because this is a stronger type of test, it can sometimes cause allergic reactions, and it is not done for some types of allergies, such as food allergies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H553618814\"><span class=\"h1\">Why do I need allergy skin testing?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor might recommend allergy skin testing if you have symptoms that seem to be caused by an allergy. The table shows common types of allergies and their symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F86626\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86626 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>If you know exactly what is causing your allergies, you can avoid those substances and choose the best treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H553618848\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens during skin allergy testing?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor might tell you to stop taking certain medicines (such as allergy medicines) for up to 1 week before you get an allergy skin test.</p><p>The pricks or injections are done on your arms and sometimes on the upper part of your back. This is not painful, but small children might find it upsetting. You might get tested for a few different substances at the same time.</p><p>If you are allergic to any of the substances, itchy red bumps usually show up in 15 to 20 minutes. The bumps go away within an hour or so.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H553618863\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=seasonal-allergies-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Seasonal allergies in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-allergy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Food allergy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=insect-allergy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Insect allergy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergic-bronchopulmonary-aspergillosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anaphylaxis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-autoinjectors-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Epinephrine autoinjectors (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=seasonal-allergies-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Seasonal allergies in children (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergic-rhinitis-seasonal-allergies-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Allergic rhinitis (seasonal allergies) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=trigger-avoidance-in-allergic-rhinitis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Trigger avoidance in allergic rhinitis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergic-conjunctivitis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Allergic conjunctivitis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-allergy-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Food allergy symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-allergy-treatment-and-avoidance-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Food allergy treatment and avoidance (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergy-to-penicillin-and-related-antibiotics-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Allergy to penicillin and related antibiotics (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=contact-dermatitis-including-latex-dermatitis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Contact dermatitis (including latex dermatitis) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-an-epinephrine-autoinjector-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Use of an epinephrine autoinjector (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
