The mechanisms of these interventions are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=light-based-adjunctive-and-other-therapies-for-acne-vulgaris\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Light-based, adjunctive, and other therapies for acne vulgaris&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Knowledge of mechanisms of action of acne therapies is combined with recognition of specific clinical features to determine the best approach to treatment. The following concepts guide the selection of therapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Topical retinoids are beneficial for both comedonal (noninflammatory) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62816%7EPC%2F80536\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62816 graphicRef80536 \">picture 1A-B</a>) and inflammatory acne (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F70809\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70809 \">picture 2A</a>) and should be included in the initial management of most patients. Topical retinoids are effective in the treatment of comedonal acne due to their ability to normalize follicular hyperkeratosis and prevent formation of the microcomedo, the primary lesion of acne [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acne-vulgaris/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The efficacy of topical retinoids for inflammatory acne [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acne-vulgaris/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>] may be due to a combination of intrinsic anti-inflammatory properties of topical retinoids and their ability to prevent the formation of microcomedones. Topical retinoids can be used as monotherapy in individuals with exclusively comedonal acne.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with an inflammatory component often benefit from antimicrobial therapies (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benzoyl-peroxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benzoyl peroxide</a> or topical antibiotics). Antimicrobial agents reduce the number of proinflammatory <em>C. acnes</em> colonizing the skin. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Topical antimicrobials'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with moderate to severe inflammatory acne often warrant more aggressive treatment with oral antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acne-vulgaris/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Antibiotics in the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a> class are most frequently used, and appear to have both antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Oral antibiotics'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benzoyl-peroxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benzoyl peroxide</a> with topical or oral antibiotics decreases the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Therefore, use of benzoyl peroxide is recommended in patients receiving antibiotic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acne-vulgaris/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Oral antibiotics'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Androgens stimulate increased sebum production, which contributes to the formation of acne [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acne-vulgaris/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Hormonal therapy may benefit women with moderate to severe acne, even in the absence of a hyperandrogenic state. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hormonal-therapy-for-women-with-acne-vulgaris\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hormonal therapy for women with acne vulgaris&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be given realistic expectations regarding timelines for improvement. Improvement in acne is dependent upon both the prevention and resolution of acne papules, pustules, and nodules. At least two to three months of consistent adherence to a therapeutic regimen is often necessary prior to concluding that treatment is ineffective. Adjustments to the regimen also may be needed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acne typically recurs over years, and maintenance therapy is an important component of acne management.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hormonal-therapy-for-women-with-acne-vulgaris\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hormonal therapy for women with acne vulgaris&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Consistent adherence to acne therapy is critical for achieving clinical improvement. When recommending topical therapy, the clinician should design a regimen that is feasible for the patient. This should involve a discussion with the patient to ensure that each component of the treatment regimen is acceptable to the patient. We typically design regimens that require the patient to treat no more than once or twice daily. </p><p>A sample regimen for a patient with mild inflammatory facial acne who is using a topical retinoid, topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benzoyl-peroxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benzoyl peroxide</a>, and topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Morning:</strong> Wash face with a gentle facial cleanser. Apply a thin layer of a fixed-dose combination <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benzoyl-peroxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benzoyl peroxide</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a></span> gel to the entire face. (An alternative regimen could require the patient to wash the face with a benzoyl peroxide cleanser followed by application of a thin layer of topical clindamycin to the entire face.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Night:</strong> Wash face with a gentle facial cleanser. Apply a thin layer of the topical retinoid to the entire face.</p><p/><p>Some patients may prefer the use of fixed-dose combination products to simplify treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F56087\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56087 \">table 4</a>). However, the cost of such treatments may be higher than single-active ingredient agents. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Combination therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>The selection of the delivery system for topical acne medications also may help to improve the likelihood of adherence to treatment. The choice depends upon the patient's skin type (dry versus oily) and preference. Some gels have a drying effect; they may be preferred by patients with oily skin. Creams and lotions tend to be moisturizing. Solutions are drying but they cover large areas more easily than other preparations, and foams are easy to apply to hair-bearing areas. Pledgets are single-use absorbent pads impregnated with medication. They are convenient to use and facilitate the spreading of medication over large areas. </p><p>Clinicians should be aware that further modifications to the vehicle of a drug may also affect characteristics such as efficacy, tolerability, or stability. As an example, the microsphere formulation of tretinoin consists of tretinoin contained in microscopic biodegradable spherical particles. As the microspheres are degraded, tretinoin is slowly and progressively delivered to the skin. This formulation is associated with improved drug stability and decreased irritation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acne-vulgaris/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Topical retinoids'</a> below.)</p><p>Procedural therapies are sometimes used in conjunction with conventional medical therapy. These interventions are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=light-based-adjunctive-and-other-therapies-for-acne-vulgaris#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Light-based, adjunctive, and other therapies for acne vulgaris&quot;, section on 'Light/laser therapies'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=light-based-adjunctive-and-other-therapies-for-acne-vulgaris#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Light-based, adjunctive, and other therapies for acne vulgaris&quot;, section on 'Adjunctive therapies'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H541816134\"><span class=\"h2\">Truncal acne</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the treatment of both facial and truncal acne can be approached similarly, a challenge for the treatment of truncal acne is the difficulty associated with applying topical treatments to the entire affected area. Given the difficulty that patients may have applying medications to areas such as the back compared with the face and the large quantity of topical medication required for use on large areas, we have a lower threshold for incorporating oral antibiotic or oral hormonal therapies into the treatment regimen. Pharmacy-provided medication applicators designed to aid with application of medication or emollients to the back are sometimes helpful for topical treatment. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H238988039\"><span class=\"h2\">Children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The medical therapies used for the treatment of acne in children are similar to the management of acne in adolescents and adults. A significant exception is the need to avoid the use of tetracyclines in children under the age of nine years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acne-vulgaris/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acne-vulgaris#H238986976\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of acne vulgaris&quot;, section on 'Childhood acne'</a> and <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Tetracyclines'</a> below.)</p><p>An additional important consideration for acne therapy in children and adolescents is the implementation of measures to optimize adherence to therapy. Careful efforts should be made to recognize when the complexity of the regimen, the child or adolescent's dislike of the vehicle prescribed (eg, cream, lotion, gel), or drug side effects inhibit consistent use of acne medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acne-vulgaris/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Discussing adherence to the treatment regimen and obstacles to adherence at each visit allows for therapeutic adjustments that may lead to more consistent treatment and a better clinical response. In addition, thorough discussions of realistic expectations for treatment may help to prevent premature discontinuation of therapy by a child or adolescent who is discouraged by the lack of an immediate and complete disappearance of acne lesions.</p><p>Recommendations on the management of pediatric acne vulgaris formulated by a panel of experts and endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics have been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acne-vulgaris/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Subantimicrobial doses of antibiotics are doses for which the anti-inflammatory properties are maintained, but antibacterial action is absent. In this manner, the potential for inducing antibacterial resistance is diminished. The tetracyclines, particularly doxycycline, are often administered at subantimicrobial doses for treating acne. This lower dosage may block inflammation in acne through multiple mechanisms, including the inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases, regulation of inflammatory cytokines, inhibition of leukocyte chemotaxis and activation, and antioxidation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acne-vulgaris/abstract/161\" class=\"abstract_t\">161</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A multicenter, randomized trial revealed that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> 20 mg twice daily was more effective than placebo for the treatment of moderate acne vulgaris [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acne-vulgaris/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>].
