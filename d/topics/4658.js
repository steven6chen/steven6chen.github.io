However, many ischemic strokes occur without a well-defined etiology and are labeled as cryptogenic.</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of cryptogenic stroke. A discussion of stroke classification and the clinical diagnosis of stroke subtypes is found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-classification-and-epidemiology-of-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, classification, and epidemiology of stroke&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-diagnosis-of-stroke-subtypes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical diagnosis of stroke subtypes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In its most useful clinical sense, the term cryptogenic stroke designates the category of ischemic stroke for which no probable cause is found despite a thorough diagnostic evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-stroke/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The cryptogenic stroke category was devised first, for research purposes, in the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Stroke Data Bank [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-stroke/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>] and later modified in the TOAST trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-stroke/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Classification along these lines has become increasingly used in clinical practice, as optimal management relates to the underlying mechanism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-classification-and-epidemiology-of-stroke#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, classification, and epidemiology of stroke&quot;, section on 'TOAST classification'</a>.)</p><p>By the TOAST classification (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F62571\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62571 \">table 1</a>), which is the one most commonly used in clinical practice, cryptogenic stroke (or stroke of undetermined origin in TOAST terminology) is defined as brain infarction that is not attributable to a source of definite cardioembolism, large artery atherosclerosis, or small artery disease despite a standard vascular, cardiac, and serologic evaluation. The category of stroke of undetermined etiology in the TOAST classification includes patients with less well-established potential causes of cardiac embolism, such as patent foramen ovale, aortic arch atheroma, and mitral valve strands, as well as potential prothrombotic disorders; stroke of undetermined etiology also includes patients with two or more equally plausible identified causes of stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-stroke/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>In addition to TOAST, there are several other ischemic stroke classification systems that include a category for stroke of undetermined cause, as discussed in detail separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-classification-and-epidemiology-of-stroke#H60049534\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, classification, and epidemiology of stroke&quot;, section on 'SSS-TOAST and CCS classification'</a>). Among these, the Causative Classification System (CCS) was designed to determine the most likely cause of stroke even when multiple possible mechanisms are present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F57732\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57732 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-stroke/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4176825845\"><span class=\"h2\">Embolic stroke of undetermined source</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most cryptogenic strokes are likely embolic, as described below. This understanding is captured by a related concept, termed embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS), which is defined as a nonlacunar brain infarct without proximal arterial stenosis or cardioembolic sources [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-stroke/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The concept of ESUS, moreover, implies that a full standard evaluation was done, whereas traditional definitions of cryptogenic stroke did not require a full evaluation. The criteria for ESUS are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stroke detected by CT or MRI that is not lacunar (lacunar is defined as a subcortical infarct in the distribution of the small, penetrating cerebral arteries whose largest dimension is &le;1.5 cm on CT or &le;2.0 cm on MRI diffusion images)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of extracranial or intracranial atherosclerosis causing &ge;50 percent luminal stenosis of the artery supplying the area of ischemia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No major-risk cardioembolic source of embolism (ie, no permanent or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, sustained atrial flutter, intracardiac thrombus, prosthetic cardiac valve, atrial myxoma or other cardiac tumors, mitral stenosis, recent (within four weeks) myocardial infarction, left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;30 percent, valvular vegetations, or infective endocarditis)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No other specific cause of stroke identified (eg, arteritis, dissection, migraine, vasospasm, drug abuse)</p><p/><p>Thus, ESUS represents a subset of cryptogenic stroke and emphasizes the likelihood that most strokes of unexplained etiology are probably embolic from an unestablished source [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-stroke/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H311689310\"><span class=\"h1\">POSSIBLE MECHANISMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Numerous mechanisms for cryptogenic stroke have been proposed. The most likely mechanisms include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac embolism secondary to occult paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF), aortic atheromatous disease, or other cardiac sources</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paradoxical embolism, which originates in the systemic venous circulation and enters the systemic arterial circulation through a patent foramen ovale (PFO), atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, or extracardiac communication such as a pulmonary arteriovenous malformation </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Undefined thrombophilia (ie, hypercoagulable states including those related to antiphospholipid antibodies or to occult cancer with hypercoagulability of malignancy)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Substenotic cerebrovascular disease (ie, intracranial and extracranial atherosclerotic disease causing less than 50 percent stenosis) and other vasculopathies (eg, dissection)</p><p/><p>It is also likely that important but unidentified mechanisms exist, awaiting discovery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3463135946\"><span class=\"h2\">Embolism from occult sources in the heart or aorta</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The embolic appearance of most cryptogenic strokes implies that the cause is embolism from an occult source in the heart, aorta, or large artery. Cardioaortic conditions with a low or uncertain risk for embolic stroke include difficult to diagnose (&quot;occult&quot;) or subclinical atrial fibrillation and related atrial cardiopathies, atrial septal abnormalities, complex aortic atheroma, and others (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F60843\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60843 \">table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2560277323\"><span class=\"h3\">Occult atrial fibrillation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Occult paroxysmal AF refers to asymptomatic paroxysmal AF in a patient without a prior history of AF, which is detected only by monitoring techniques. Evidence linking occult AF and cryptogenic stroke comes from the prospective ASSERT study of 2580 subjects, age &ge;65 years, with hypertension and no history of AF who had recent implantation of a pacemaker or defibrillator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-stroke/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. At three months, subclinical atrial tachyarrhythmias detected by the implanted devices had occurred in 10 percent of patients, and were associated with an increased risk (at a mean of 2.5 years) for clinical AF (hazard ratio [HR] 5.6, 95% CI 3.8-8.2) and for the combined endpoint of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism (HR 2.5, 95% CI 1.3-4.9). Among subjects with at least three months of continuous monitoring who experienced ischemic stroke or systemic embolism (n = 51), subclinical AF was detected overall in 26 (51 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-stroke/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, subclinical AF occurring &le;30 days before ischemic stroke or systemic embolism was detected in only 4 subjects (8 percent). Thus, while subclinical AF was associated with an increased risk of embolic events, there was no definite temporal relationship of subclinical AF with stroke in most subjects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2890532970\"><span class=\"h3\">Atrial septal abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atrial septal abnormalities, including PFO, atrial septal aneurysm, and atrial septal defect have been associated with cryptogenic stroke, although the strength and clinical significance of this association is uncertain. There is an increased prevalence of PFO and atrial septal aneurysm in patients who have had a cryptogenic stroke, particularly in patients &lt;55 years old. However, population-based studies suggest that PFO and large PFO are not independent risk factors for stroke. In addition, prospective data suggest that PFO alone is not associated with a meaningfully increased risk of recurrent stroke or death in patients who have already had a cryptogenic stroke. These issues are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-septal-abnormalities-pfo-asd-and-asa-and-risk-of-cerebral-emboli-in-adults#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial septal abnormalities (PFO, ASD, and ASA) and risk of cerebral emboli in adults&quot;, section on 'Risk of embolic stroke'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2911262354\"><span class=\"h3\">Atrial cardiopathies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Even in the absence of diagnosed atrial fibrillation, biomarkers of atrial dysfunction are associated with risk of ischemic stroke. For example, serum troponin and pro-brain natriuretic peptide (proBNP) are associated with both AF and stroke. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-biomarkers-for-stroke#H30408554\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood biomarkers for stroke&quot;, section on 'BNP and cardioembolic stroke'</a>.)</p><p>Similarly, P wave terminal force velocity in lead V1 (PWTFV1), a measure of atrial contraction that can be measured on the electrocardiogram, is associated with stroke risk even in the absence of AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-stroke/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Although cardioembolism is presumed to be the most likely mechanism of stroke in patients with elevated proBNP or PWTFV1, it is difficult to establish a cause and effect relationship between these elevated cardiac biomarkers and occult cardioembolism; the association is confounded because cardiac disease and elevated cardiac biomarkers are also markers of systemic atherosclerosis. In addition, these biomarkers are not widely available in clinical practice and their utility for management is still uncertain. However, these biomarkers have the advantage of being measurable at the time of stroke without the need for long-term monitoring, and thus provide the potential to detect a high risk of cardioembolism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-biomarkers-for-stroke#H30408554\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood biomarkers for stroke&quot;, section on 'BNP and cardioembolic stroke'</a>.)</p><p>Further prospective study is needed to confirm that any of these biomarkers reliably predict a cardioembolic stroke mechanism and response to anticoagulant therapy in secondary stroke prevention.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1061140326\"><span class=\"h3\">Aortic embolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thoracic aortic atherosclerotic plaques are an important potential source of systemic emboli, leading to stroke, transient ischemic attack, and embolization to other arterial beds. The risk of thromboembolism in patients with aortic atherosclerosis is increased when there is complex plaque, which is defined as thickness &gt;4 mm or ulceration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=embolism-from-aortic-plaque-thromboembolism#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Embolism from aortic plaque: Thromboembolism&quot;, section on 'Complex aortic plaque'</a>.)</p><p>Besides proximal aortic atheromas, distal aortic sources of embolism have been proposed as a potential cause for cryptogenic stroke. One study using cardiac MRI suggested that complex atheromas in the descending aortic arch could lead to stroke via retrograde flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-stroke/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. During diastole, retrograde flow in the descending aorta reached the great vessels supplying the brain in up to 24 percent of patients with cryptogenic stroke. This finding suggests that embolic material in the descending aortic arch could enter the cerebral vasculature during retrograde flow and cause ischemic stroke.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H482822533\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary shunts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intrapulmonary right-to-left shunts due to pulmonary arteriovenous malformations or arteriovenous fistulas have been associated with cryptogenic stroke in several small studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-stroke/abstract/12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-arteriovenous-malformations-clinical-features-and-diagnostic-evaluation-in-adults#H111280348\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations: Clinical features and diagnostic evaluation in adults&quot;, section on 'Neurologic'</a>.)</p><p>Other potential causes of stroke include coarctation of the aorta and aortic dissection. </p><p>The relationship of aortic embolism and stroke is reviewed in detail separately.

After stroke recurrence, six patients had evidence of large artery atherosclerosis, one was classified as cardioembolic (new onset atrial fibrillation), and four were still cryptogenic. The authors proposed that in their population, the predominant mechanism of cryptogenic stroke was progression of large vessel atherosclerosis or plaque instability.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data from autopsy studies suggest that ischemic stroke can be associated with lesser degrees of extracranial and intracranial large vessel stenosis (eg, 30 to 70 percent) or with vulnerable plaques without appreciable luminal compromise. Supporting evidence comes from the following observations:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a case-control study that included 259 patients with fatal ischemic stroke, intracranial atherosclerotic plaques (with or without stenosis) were noted in 62 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-stroke/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Furthermore, plaques with superimposed thrombi and stenosis of 30 to 70 percent were considered responsible for infarcts in four cases (1.5 percent), a group that would have been classified as cryptogenic in non-autopsy studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-stroke/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a subsequent study from the same investigators, plaques and stenoses involving the origin or proximal vertebral artery were present in more than twice as many patients with infarcts in posterior circulation as compared with anterior circulation infarcts (adjusted OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.01-4.38) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-stroke/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. These lesions may be responsible for a larger proportion of strokes in the brainstem and posterior circulation than previously appreciated.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1258644329\"><span class=\"h2\">Other causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is possible that subtle or undetected abnormalities of the larger arteries, coagulation system, and genetic factors may be missed during the initial evaluation. These conditions include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonatherosclerotic vasculopathies, such as dissection, fibromuscular dysplasia, reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndromes (RCVS), and vasculitis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occult hypercoagulable states, such as the antiphospholipid syndrome, genetic thrombophilia, and hypercoagulable state associated with malignancy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rare genetic conditions may present with stroke in the young; monogenic syndromes associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke include Fabry disease, cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarctions and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), and sickle cell disease</p><p/><p>However, detection of any of the above conditions would alter the diagnostic classification of stroke from cryptogenic stroke to stroke of other determined cause.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Large epidemiologic studies have consistently reported that cryptogenic stroke accounts for 25 to 40 percent of ischemic stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-stroke/abstract/20-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-28</a>]. The incidence and prevalence of stroke subtypes among these studies may vary based upon the demographics of the study population, diagnostic definitions, extent of diagnostic evaluation, and methodology. Thus, it is conceivable that some strokes of other determined cause (eg, migraine, dissection, vasculitis) were misclassified in the undetermined category (ie, as cryptogenic) due to inadequate work-up or the limitations of diagnostic detection. However, given the rarity of these other causes in most registries (usually representing less than 5 percent of all strokes), this would not account for all cryptogenic strokes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Demographic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of cryptogenic stroke may vary by demographics, with higher incidence rates in blacks and Hispanics than in whites, but no clear association has been found for age and gender.</p><p>With the exception of the strokes classified in TOAST as &quot;other determined etiology&quot; (which includes dissection), all stroke subtypes are rare in the young, and incidence rates rise dramatically with increasing age. A few studies have reported that cryptogenic stroke disproportionately affects younger individuals, but the evidence is inconsistent.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Northern Manhattan Stroke Study (NOMASS, 1993 to 1996), 55 percent of strokes in the young (age &lt;45 years) were cryptogenic versus 42 percent in the older (age &gt;45 years) group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-stroke/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 2003 meta-analysis, young age (defined as &lt;50 years) was inversely associated with cryptogenic stroke with a total OR of 0.6 (95% CI 0.4-1.0, p = 0.05) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-stroke/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other stroke registries found lower rates (23 to 34 percent) in younger age groups, which were similar to those in older age groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-stroke/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. </p><p/><p>The incidence of cryptogenic stroke may be higher in blacks and Hispanics than in whites. In NOMASS, incidence rates of all ischemic stroke subtypes, including cryptogenic stroke, were higher in blacks and Hispanics than in whites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-stroke/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In the Greater <span class=\"nowrap\">Cincinnati/Northern</span> Kentucky Stroke Study (GCNKSS), blacks had twice the annual incidence rate of cryptogenic stroke as whites (125 versus 65 per 100,000 persons), a result not confounded by differential testing patterns among black versus white patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-stroke/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In San Diego, an increased prevalence (nearly 46 percent) of cryptogenic stroke was seen in Mexican-American patients, a statistic again that was not explained by differences in diagnostic testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-stroke/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Other risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although risk factors often help unravel stroke mechanisms, the two are not always synonymous. While it is possible to compare risk factors for cryptogenic stroke versus other stroke subtypes, the comparison is hindered in large part by definitional constraints. As an example, atrial fibrillation will be rare in cryptogenic stroke because of the way in which the subtypes are defined. In addition, risk factors that are associated with large artery ischemic stroke (eg, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, peripheral vascular disease, and diabetes mellitus) and cardioembolic stroke (eg, acute coronary events) are underrepresented in patients with cryptogenic stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-stroke/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Several studies have documented that hypertension is less common in cryptogenic stroke compared with other stroke subtypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-stroke/abstract/23,24,26,27,34,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24,26,27,34,36</a>]. However, patients with cryptogenic stroke may have an increased prevalence of hypertension compared with stroke-free controls, and one case-control study found that hypertension was associated with cryptogenic stroke (OR 4.5, 95% CI 1.5-13.2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-stroke/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>The prevalence of cardiac disease among patients with cryptogenic stroke varies from 10 to 30 percent. In Rochester, coronary artery disease was less common in the undetermined (ie, cryptogenic) subtype than in the large artery atherosclerosis subtype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-stroke/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Studies assessing the prevalence of prothrombotic states and genetic polymorphisms predisposing individuals to thrombosis have <strong>not</strong> yielded convincing evidence that these are more common in patients with cryptogenic stroke than nonstroke controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-stroke/abstract/38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-41</a>]. Nevertheless, the available reports are small and not definitive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with cryptogenic stroke typically present with sudden onset of focal neurologic deficits and an embolic infarct topography on brain imaging. Superficial hemispheric infarction is present in 62 to 84 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-stroke/abstract/20,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,42</a>]. In one study of patients with cryptogenic stroke, cortical signs were present in 27 percent, and abrupt onset occurred in 59 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-stroke/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Lacunar syndromes are rare, accounting for usually less than 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-stroke/abstract/20,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,42</a>]. The severity of the initial presentation varies but, on average, tends to be milder than cardioembolic strokes and worse than lacunar strokes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-stroke/abstract/17,27,42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,27,42-44</a>].</p><p>A significant proportion of cryptogenic strokes adhere to embolic infarct topography on brain imaging (CT or MRI). Forty percent of cryptogenic strokes in the Stroke Data Bank were found to have cortical infarcts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-stroke/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Among 314 patients with cryptogenic stroke in the PFO-ASA study, 56 percent had superficial infarcts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-stroke/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The German Stroke Study found that parenchymal hemorrhagic transformation occurred in approximately 2 percent of patients with stroke of unknown etiology in the first seven days, comparable to the percentage among cardioembolic stroke, suggesting an embolic mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-stroke/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Large subcortical strokes (&gt;15 mm) also tend to be either cryptogenic or cardioembolic in origin.</p><p>Noninvasive vascular imaging typically does not identify a relevant vessel stenosis or occlusion in most patients with cryptogenic stroke, except the possibility of distal branch occlusion. However, in prospective data from the Stroke Data Bank, conventional angiography revealed large artery lesions in a significant minority of patients initially classified as having infarcts of undetermined cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-stroke/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>In patients with cryptogenic stroke, the most frequently found abnormalities with echocardiography are patent foramen ovale (PFO), atrial septal aneurysm (ASA), and aortic atheromas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-stroke/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].

Mortality rates are lower than those for cardioembolic stroke but higher than those for small artery disease.</p><p>Overall, the short-term risk of recurrent stroke after cryptogenic stroke is intermediate between the high early risk after large artery atherosclerosis stroke and low risk after small artery disease stroke. In the Oxford meta-analysis of four large population-based studies, the risk of recurrent stroke after cryptogenic stroke was 1.6 percent at seven days, 4.2 percent at one month, and 5.6 percent at three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-stroke/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. In the NINDS Stroke Data Bank, 3 percent of patients with cryptogenic stroke had recurrent events at one month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-stroke/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. In the NOMASS study at three months, the risk of recurrence for the cryptogenic group was 3.7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-stroke/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>], slightly lower than those found in the Oxford meta-analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-stroke/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p>At two years, recurrence risk ranges from 14 to 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-stroke/abstract/22,65,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,65,69</a>].

At five years, the long-term recurrence risk was 33.2 percent in Rochester, not significantly different from the other subtypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-stroke/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1104605383\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS) is defined as a nonlacunar brain infarct without proximal arterial stenosis or cardioembolic sources. ESUS represents a subset of cryptogenic stroke. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathophysiology of cryptogenic stroke is likely heterogeneous. Proposed mechanisms include cardiac embolism secondary to occult paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, aortic atheromatous disease or other cardiac sources, paradoxical embolism from atrial septal abnormalities such as patent foramen ovale, hypercoagulable states, and preclinical or subclinical cerebrovascular disease. (See <a href=\"#H311689310\" class=\"local\">'Possible mechanisms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cryptogenic stroke accounts for 25 to 40 percent of ischemic stroke. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cryptogenic stroke presents with superficial hemispheric infarction in the majority of patients, and a significant proportion of cryptogenic strokes adhere to embolic infarct topography on brain imaging. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cryptogenic stroke is a diagnosis of exclusion. The diagnosis is made when a standard evaluation reveals no definite evidence of cardioembolism, large artery atherosclerosis, small artery disease, or other determined etiology, and no evidence of atrial fibrillation on a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and on 24-hour cardiac monitoring. Additional studies can be pursued if the standard evaluation fails to determine the probable cause. We suggest ambulatory cardiac monitoring for several weeks (eg, 30 days) for all adult patients with a cryptogenic ischemic stroke or cryptogenic transient ischemic stroke (TIA). (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The acute management of cryptogenic stroke is similar to that of other ischemic stroke subtypes. For secondary prevention, most patients with an ischemic stroke or TIA should be treated with blood pressure reduction, antithrombotic therapy, statin therapy, and lifestyle modification. However, the optimal antithrombotic therapy of patients with cryptogenic stroke who have atrial septal aneurysm, atheromatous aortic disease, or coagulation disorders is uncertain. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with a first cryptogenic stroke, we recommend antiplatelet therapy rather than anticoagulant therapy while awaiting the results of long-term cardiac monitoring (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1099068027\" class=\"local\">'Pending long-term cardiac monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients initially diagnosed with cryptogenic stroke who have atrial fibrillation of any duration detected on long-term monitoring, even if detected remotely from the incident stroke, we suggest anticoagulant therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> or a non-vitamin K dependent oral anticoagulant (NOAC) rather than antiplatelet therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H329639613\" class=\"local\">'Occult or subclinical atrial fibrillation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Percutaneous PFO closure in addition to antiplatelet therapy is suggested for patients age &le;60 years with an embolic-appearing cryptogenic ischemic stroke who have a PFO with a right-to-left shunt detected by bubble study. (See <a href=\"#H2316212351\" class=\"local\">'Presence of a PFO'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients on antiplatelet therapy who have a recurrent cryptogenic stroke and no atrial fibrillation on re-evaluation with long-term cardiac monitoring, options include continuing the same antiplatelet agent or switching to another antiplatelet agent; for patients with recurrent ESUS, switching to empiric anticoagulant therapy is also a reasonable option. (See <a href=\"#H149797678\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent cryptogenic stroke'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compared with other stroke subtypes, cryptogenic stroke tends to have a better prognosis and lower long-term risk of recurrence.
