This selective filtration occurs across the glomerular capillary wall:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Under normal circumstances, the glomerular capillary wall is extremely permeable to water and small solutes, but negligibly to albumin or other proteins of equivalent molecular weight or larger.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Defects in the glomerular capillary wall result in increased permeability to albumin and proteins of similar size or even larger, causing proteinuria.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrical potential differences generated by transglomerular flow may modulate the flux of anionic (charged) albumin across the glomerular capillary wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p/><p>The traditional view that the glomerular capillary wall hinders the transit of protein is largely based upon micropuncture studies that demonstrated very low concentrations of albumin in Bowman's space in non-nephrotic animals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. This view has been challenged by newer data that have demonstrated by intravital 2-photon microscopy, much higher concentrations of albumin in Bowman's space than were reported previously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Given the novelty of the technique of intravital multiphoton microscopy (MPM), these observations need to be validated in other systems and species, especially since they substantially alter our understanding of the pathogenesis of proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>].</p><p>It is not known, however, why the filter does not routinely clog with large proteins that enter the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). It has been hypothesized that proteins cross the GBM mainly by diffusion rather than by liquid flow, whereas water crosses entirely by flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Alternatively, generation of a filtration-dependent electric potential difference could influence the glomerular sieving coefficient of albumin<em> </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Several factors may prevent clogging of the filter with large proteins. An active transport involving the neonatal Fc receptor has been identified that may remove immunoglobulins that accumulate at the filtration barrier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In addition, human podocytes perform polarized, caveolae-dependent albumin endocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] and also undergo macropinocytosis at sites of membrane ruffling (a clathrin-independent specialized endocytic process defined by the formation of large vesicles measuring 0.2 to 5 microm in diameter). Free fatty acids associated with serum albumin stimulate macropinocytosis, which may amplify the effect of proteinuria in the nephrotic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. All of these clearance processes may coexist to avoid clogging of the glomerular filter. Genetic or acquired impairment of the clearance machinery may be a common mechanism promoting glomerular diseases.</p><p>Over the last decade, studies among patients with hereditary proteinuric syndromes have markedly advanced our knowledge of the structure and composition of the glomerular capillary wall and the changes in its composition that lead to proteinuria. However, the changes in the glomerular capillary wall that underlie proteinuria in hereditary diseases do not necessarily account for the proteinuria that accompanies acquired causes of nephrotic syndrome, which are much more common. Thus, the underlying molecular mechanisms of acquired proteinuric diseases remain less well characterized.</p><p>It is increasingly appreciated that defects in podocyte structure and function result in increased glomerular permeability. This topic review will focus primarily on the biology of glomerular podocytes and defects in podocyte structure that appear to underlie many proteinuric renal diseases.</p><p>Reviews of clinical proteinuria, including causes, manifestations, and treatment of specific glomerular disease, are presented separately.

The pores between the foot processes (slit pores) are closed by a thin membrane called the slit diaphragm, which functions as a modified adherens junction and may also be permeated by anatomical pores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p>Defects in any of the three components of the glomerular capillary wall can lead to proteinuria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F50018\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50018 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>]. In addition, cross-talk between podocytes and endothelial and mesangial cells are key to the maintenance of glomerular capillary wall function. As examples, the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by podocytes is necessary for the integrity of the glomerular endothelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], and the upregulation and secretion of the podocyte protein, angiopoietin-like-4 (Angptl4) into the glomerular capillary wall causes marked proteinuria in experimental models of nephrotic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Multiphoton microscopy (MPM) has the necessary spatial and temporal resolution to study complex cell-to-cell interactions between different cell types of the glomerular filtration barrier as well as circulating blood cells and plasma factors in vivo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PODOCYTES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Podocytes are terminally differentiated epithelial cells that have large cell bodies and long primary or major processes. The primary processes attach to the underlying GBM via multiple foot processes. Adhesion molecules, such as alpha3beta1 integrin complex and dystroglycan (which are present on the basal membrane of foot processes), attach the podocyte to the GBM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Slit diaphragm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The interdigitating foot processes of adjacent podocytes are joined laterally by slit diaphragms that bridge the intervening filtration slits.

They interact with the actin cytoskeleton of podocyte foot processes via linker proteins. These include CD2-associated protein (CD2AP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>], Nck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>], zona occludens-1, and the catenins. Selective deletion of Nck expression in podocytes of adult mice rapidly leads to proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis, and altered morphology of foot processes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Mutations of some of the genes that encode slit diaphragm proteins cause rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton, which results in foot process effacement and proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The use of phosphoproteomics has identified 146 phosphorylation sites on proteins abundantly expressed in podocytes, and, as one example, phosphorylation occurs at a site on the podocin protein that is mutated in a genetic form of nephrotic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Nephrin and Neph1 also interact directly with the Par3-aPKC protein complex at the podocyte intercellular junction, suggesting that this complex plays a key role in the establishment and maintenance of podocyte polarity as it does in other polarized epithelia and neurons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>].</p><p>Reviews of the evidence showing that abnormalities of these proteins are causative in some congenital disorders are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-and-infantile-nephrotic-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital and infantile nephrotic syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, classification, and pathogenesis of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Actin cytoskeleton</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Podocyte architecture is maintained by a contractile apparatus composed of microfilaments comprising actin, type I and type II myosins, alpha-actinin, talin, paxillin, and vinculin, and palladin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. The opposing effects of molecules such as slit-1-Robo2 and cofilin-1, which counteract filament polymerization, are equally important to the actin cytoskeleton. This cytoskeleton helps to support the glomerular capillary wall, which is subject to the high hydrostatic pressure necessary for glomerular filtration and plays a key role in the foot process architecture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F50016\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50016 \">figure 1</a>). The actin cytoskeleton also contributes to the highly motile character of these specialized cells. Mutations in known regulators of the actin cytoskeleton have been implicated in the etiology of proteinuric diseases.</p><p>Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy have demonstrated two distinct actin cytoskeletal networks present in the foot processes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dense actin bundles are present above the level of the slit diaphragm and extend parallel to the longitudinal axis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A cortical actin network extends just below the plasma membrane of the foot processes.</p><p/><p>Different actin-binding proteins are associated with each of these networks. Thus, whereas alpha-actinin and synaptopodin are associated with the actin bundles above the slit diaphragm, the cortical actin network co-localizes with cortactin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H51596040\"><span class=\"h2\">Endocytosis, mitochondrial fitness, and autophagy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The concept that podocytes internalize and remove proteins was proposed over 50 years ago. However, the physiological relevance of this has remained elusive, although some studies noted a requirement for endocytic processes in podocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. As an example, podocyte deficiency in the vacuolar protein sorting-34 (Vps34), which controls several vesicular trafficking processes, leads to podocyte vacuolization and defective autophagy, early proteinuria, glomerular scarring, and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Rat and human podocytes display the two endocytic receptors, megalin and cubilin, which are responsible for the only documented process for protein reabsorption in proximal tubule cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/47,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,49</a>]. Defective lysosomal activity, as observed in mice deficient in the lysosomal proteinase cathepsin-D, induces apoptotic podocyte death followed by proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>Mitochondrial health is important for podocyte function and for providing protection from apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that periodically divide (fission) and fuse (fusion). Mitochondrial fission is closely associated with key features of diabetic nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Podocyte deficiency in dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), a protein which is essential for mitochondrial fission, improves mitochondrial fitness and protects against progression of diabetic nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Some mitochondrial disorders of the podocyte could be amenable to treatment-targeted approaches. As an example, rapamycin has extended the lifespan of mice deficient in the mitochondrial membrane protein prohibitin-2 (PHB2), which develop disorganized mitochondria and missing cristae, foot process effacement, glomerulosclerosis, albuminuria, and renal impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>In addition to endocytosis and mitochondrial fitness, autophagy has been identified as a major pathway that delivers damaged proteins and organelles to lysosomes in order to maintain cellular homeostasis. Autophagy is substantially increased in glomeruli from mice with induced proteinuria and from patients with acquired proteinuric diseases. Podocyte-specific deletion of autophagy-related-5 (Atg5) led to a glomerulopathy in aging mice and strongly increased susceptibility to models of glomerular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. When Atg5 or Atg7 were mutated during nephrogenesis, mice developed a disease similar to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Analogous changes were observed in human idiopathic FSGS kidney biopsy specimens. Podocytes from patients with minimal change disease (MCD) have higher levels of Beclin-1-mediated autophagic activity than glomeruli from FSGS patients. Also, repeat renal biopsies confirmed that patients maintaining high podocyte autophagic activity retained MCD status, whereas patients with decreased podocyte autophagic activity progressed to FSGS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Impaired autophagy resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum stress could play a major role in the progression of podocytopathies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Foot process effacement and cytoskeleton rearrangement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Flattening of foot processes or foot process effacement is a characteristic histologic finding associated with most primary and secondary glomerular diseases. It could represent a protective response of podocytes to escape detachment from the GBM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton is necessary for foot process effacement to occur, and stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton decreases proteinuria. The actin cytoskeleton is a fluid structure that can be quickly and reversibly reorganized. It is a direct target of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> A, which is an effective treatment for reducing nephrotic range proteinuria among patients with minimal change disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. The effect of cyclosporine A on the cytoskeleton is independent of its effect on T cell dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rituximab</a> may also have a podocyte effect through stabilization of acid sphingomyelinase (ASM)-like phosphodiesterase 3b, which regulates the generation of ceramide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>Actin is normally organized into coordinated stress fibers in mature foot processes. Podocyte injury causes the rearrangement of actin to a dense network [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>The cytoskeleton can be altered by at least four different mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Direct injury of podocytes can occur by systemic or locally produced toxins (ie, reactive oxygen species), viral infection, drugs (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=pamidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pamidronate</a>, interferon) or local activation of the renin angiotensin system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormalities of cytoskeletal structural proteins can adversely affect cytoskeletal dynamics. An example is mutations of alpha-actinin-4, which cause hereditary focal segmental glomerular sclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. This abnormality increases the affinity of alpha-actinin-4 for actin, which may alter cytoskeletal fluidity.

Genetic variations in the MYH9 locus are associated with progressive nondiabetic proteinuric kidney disease in African Americans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>].

Similar intracellular events, such as phosphorylation of constituent proteins, appear to occur during development of the foot processes and after podocyte injury. During podocyte differentiation, for example, nephrin is transiently phosphorylated on multiple tyrosine residues by the Src family kinase, Fyn [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Phosphorylation of nephrin allows its interaction with Nck, which is required for actin reorganization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Decreased nephrin phosphorylation may occur following podocyte injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. Nephrin tyrosine phosphorylation is required to stabilize and restore podocyte foot process architecture, and a model has been presented in which changes in phosphotyrosine-based signaling confer plasticity to the podocyte actin cytoskeleton [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. </p><p>Another possible mechanism of cytoskeletal rearrangement is via the degradation of dynamin, a GTPase protein that is generally considered to have a key role in deforming cellular membranes. Dynamin associates with actin, possibly via the actin-binding protein, cortactin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,72</a>].</p><p>Cleavage of dynamin by cathepsin-L may initiate reorganization of the cytoskeleton, resulting in clinical disease.

The absence of uPAR, beta3 integrin, or the alphavbeta3 integrin ligand, vitronectin, protects mice from developing lipopolysaccharide-induced proteinuria. This protection is abolished by exogenous expression of either uPAR or a constitutively active beta3 integrin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. The uPAR may be required to activate alphavbeta3 integrin in podocytes promoting cell motility and activation of small GTPases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Direct podocyte injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Podocytes may be direct targets of injury in acquired proteinuric diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Injury may be immunologic or nonimmunologic. An example of an immunologic cause of podocyte injury is the effect of antibodies directed to the phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) in primary membranous nephropathy. This effect is mediated by complement activation leading to the formation of the membrane attack complex and possibly also by interfering with the receptor function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. </p><p>Nonimmunologic causes of podocyte injury include viral infection (specifically, HIV), drug toxicity (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pamidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pamidronate</a>), local activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), and reactive oxygen species (ROS).</p><p>HIV nephropathy is characterized by collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-associated-nephropathy-hivan\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Clinical studies and animal models have shown that the podocyte is directly infected by HIV genes and may provide a reservoir for replicating virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/78,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,79</a>]. Exogenous expression of HIV genes, Nef and Vpr, causes dedifferentiation, proliferation and loss of contact inhibition, and apoptosis of podocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/78-85\" class=\"abstract_t\">78-85</a>]. Some believe that parvo B19 virus may have similar toxic effects as HIV on podocyte [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p>Inhibition of systemic RAS limits the progression of chronic kidney disease in the setting of proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. This is due, in part, to a reduction of transglomerular pressure. However, locally produced angiotensin may also have direct toxic effects on the podocyte. Angiotensin receptors -1 and -2 are expressed by podocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. Mechanical strain of cultured podocytes increases expression of the angiotensin receptor-1 as well as angiotensin-II and enhances podocyte apoptosis, which is abrogated by angiotensin receptor blockade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Furthermore, a transgenic rat that overexpresses the angiotensin receptor-1, specifically in podocytes, is characterized by proteinuria and structural changes in the podocyte that include effacement and detachment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. The prorenin receptor is highly expressed on podocytes and promotes podocyte function and survival by maintaining autophagy and protein turnover machinery. It also contributes to the control of lysosomal pH, which is important for podocyte survival and cytoskeletal integrity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].</p><p>Reactive oxygen species are produced in a number of conditions including puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>], complement activation, and metabolic disorders such as obesity. In obese patients that are prone to develop focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, albuminuria is negatively correlated with plasma adiponectin, while adiponectin knockout mice exhibit albuminuria and effacement of podocyte foot processes. The protective effect of adiponectin seems to occur through activation of adiponectin receptors expressed on the podocyte membrane and reduction of oxidative stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>].</p><p>A number of signaling pathways may lead to podocyte injury and proteinuria. In human proteinuric kidney diseases such as diabetic nephropathy and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, upregulation of Wnt1 and active beta-catenin is observed in podocytes, while podocyte-specific knockout of beta-catenin protects against development of albuminuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. Podocytes possess the complete machinery for glutamatergic signaling, and derangements in that signaling may lead to proteinuric kidney diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. The Notch pathway seems to be involved in the development of proteinuria because Notch intracellular domain is detected in injured podocytes and genetic inactivation or pharmacologic inhibition of Notch ameliorates proteinuria and podocyte damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/94,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">94,95</a>]. AKT2, a member of the AKT family of <span class=\"nowrap\">serine/threonine</span> kinases that regulate adaptation to many cellular stress-induced processes, has an essential role in podocyte protection after nephron reduction. This protein triggers a compensatory mechanism that involves mouse double minute-2 homolog (Mdm2), glycogen synthase kinase-3 (Gsk3), and Rac1. AKT2 activation by mammalian (mechanistic) target of rapamycin complex-2 (mTORC2) is also required for podocyte survival in human chronic kidney disease. These data provide an explanation for the adverse renal effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> and a criterion for the rational use of this drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].</p><p>Podocyte-specific deletion of Dicer, an enzyme that generates microRNA (small, noncoding RNA that function as important regulators of gene expression) alters cytoskeletal dynamics, and induces proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/97,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,98</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Podocyte depletion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A decrease in podocyte number resulting from apoptosis or detachment from the GBM may contribute to proteinuria and progressive glomerulosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/99-102\" class=\"abstract_t\">99-102</a>]. In many glomerular disorders that are characterized by hypertrophy, the volume of the glomerular tuft increases, despite the decrease in podocyte number [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. The resulting decrease in podocyte density causes areas of denuded GBM, which are foci for adhesions to parietal epithelial cells and eventual crescent formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Proteinuria as a toxin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although massive proteinuria may occur in the absence of obvious structural change in the slit diaphragm and foot processes, sustained proteinuria event is invariably eventually associated with foot process effacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/67,103-106\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,103-106</a>]. The mechanism underlying this phenomenon is unclear. One possibility is that exposure of podocytes to an increased concentration of albumin and IgG is sufficient to induce changes in the cytoskeleton [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-glomerular-podocytes/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The glomerular capillary wall consists of the fenestrated capillary endothelium, glomerular basement membrane (GBM), and glomerular podocytes (or epithelial cells).
