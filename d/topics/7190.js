One of these disorders is fibronectin glomerulopathy, which is a rare, familial glomerular disease caused by the deposition of fibronectin and other matrix-type proteins in glomeruli. Ultrastructurally, the deposits are electron-dense and usually homogenous to finely granular, occasionally showing fibrillar substructure.</p><p>Fibronectin glomerulopathy will be reviewed here. Other glomerular disorders resulting from the deposition or accumulation of proteins within glomeruli, including amyloidosis, fibrillary glomerulonephritis, immunotactoid glomerulonephritis, and lipoprotein glomerulopathy, are presented in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-amyloidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal amyloidosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glomerular-diseases-due-to-nonamyloid-fibrillar-deposits\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glomerular diseases due to nonamyloid fibrillar deposits&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lipoprotein-glomerulopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lipoprotein glomerulopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Biology of fibronectin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fibronectin is a large dimeric glycoprotein consisting of two similar subunits (approximately 250 kD in weight). It functions as an adhesive glycoprotein, aiding in branching morphogenesis, cellular proliferation, wound healing, phagocytosis, platelet-platelet cohesion that is mediated in part by binding to the glycoprotein <span class=\"nowrap\">IIb/IIIa</span> receptor, and thrombus formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibronectin-glomerulopathy/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>Fibronectin normally exists in a soluble or plasma form (which circulates in blood) and an insoluble or cellular form (which is seen in basement membranes and extracellular matrices).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Fibronectin deposition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although fibronectin is found in the normal glomerular mesangial matrix, enhanced fibronectin accumulation is variably observed in several different glomerulopathies, including diabetic nephropathy and lupus nephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibronectin-glomerulopathy/abstract/4-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-11</a>]. The increase in fibronectin expression in these diseases is secondary to locally stimulated mesangial and epithelial cell production of the insoluble or cellular form.</p><p>By comparison, fibronectin glomerulopathy is associated with accumulation of fibronectin that is mainly derived from the soluble plasma isoform. This was shown in a study in which the relative amounts of the two different isoforms of fibronectin were quantified by two antibodies, one of which detected both cellular and plasma fibronectins, and the other detected only the cellular form [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibronectin-glomerulopathy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Investigators examined six unrelated fibronectin glomerulopathy families and renal biopsy specimens from a total of 15 patients as well as 9 patients from four other previously reported families. Affected patients had predominant fibronectin deposits, with strong staining using the antibody against both the plasma and cellular forms but weak staining using the antibody against the cellular form.</p><p>Recurrent disease in renal allografts of patients who were transplanted for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) due to fibronectin glomerulopathy supports the hypothesis that renal accumulation of fibronectin is most likely due to an underlying abnormality in circulating plasma fibronectin:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fibronectin glomerulopathy recurred within four months in a 52-year-old woman who presented with proteinuria and reduced kidney function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibronectin-glomerulopathy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The patient had a biopsy suggestive of recurrent fibronectin glomerulopathy 19 days after transplantation, although specialized staining to confirm recurrence was not performed at that time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrence was observed in a patient in whom a renal allograft biopsy performed 23 months after transplantation revealed the typical histologic features of fibronectin glomerulopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibronectin-glomerulopathy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another patient had approximately 14 years of adequate renal function from a cadaveric kidney prior to biopsy-confirmed recurrent disease in the allograft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibronectin-glomerulopathy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p>It is unclear why fibronectin is deposited in these cases. Theoretically, fibronectin may be complexed with other proteins. Immunoglobulins do not appear to be involved, as they are generally not seen by immunohistochemical analysis. Proteomic analysis of glomeruli removed from kidney biopsies of patients with fibronectin glomerulopathy by laser capture microscopy showed that, in addition to various isoforms of fibronectin, the deposits contained large amounts of the matrix proteins fibulin-1 and fibulin-5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibronectin-glomerulopathy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This finding was unique to the deposits of fibronectin glomerulopathy. Fibulins were not expressed to a significant extent in normal glomeruli, Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules of diabetic nephropathy, or in wire-loop lesions of lupus nephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibronectin-glomerulopathy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Fibulins bind to fibronectin and regulate several functions of fibronectin, including those related to cell shape, motility, and adhesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibronectin-glomerulopathy/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. It is possible that fibulin-fibronectin complexes disrupt normal, fibronectin-dependent mesangial <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> podocyte motility, adhesion, and spreading, resulting in the characteristic clinical features. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Analysis of family clusters indicates autosomal dominant transmission of the genetic defect in fibronectin glomerulopathy, with age-related penetrance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibronectin-glomerulopathy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Linkage to the fibronectin gene was noted in several Italian and Japanese pedigrees [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibronectin-glomerulopathy/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. In one family with 8 affected subjects, for example, missense mutations in the fibronectin gene were detected and then identified in 6 of 15 unrelated pedigrees (40 percent) with fibronectin glomerulopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibronectin-glomerulopathy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Although mutations in the fibronectin gene may be necessary for fibronectin glomerulopathy to develop, they are not sufficient, since not all family members with the mutation develop clinical kidney disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibronectin-glomerulopathy/abstract/16,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,21</a>].</p><p>Functional studies of mutant fibronectin fragments have revealed decreased binding to glomerular endothelial cells and podocytes and reduced ability to induce endothelial cell spreading and cytoskeletal reorganization compared with wild-type fragments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibronectin-glomerulopathy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, these results depend upon how the mutants were constructed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibronectin-glomerulopathy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In studies using full-length fibronectin constructs, several fibronectin gene mutations found in patients with fibronectin glomerulopathy have had only minimal effects on protein conformation and matrix formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibronectin-glomerulopathy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Prior studies in animal models suggested a possible role for the gene for uteroglobin, a protein that binds with high affinity to fibronectin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibronectin-glomerulopathy/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. However, the uteroglobin gene was eventually excluded as causative for human disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibronectin-glomerulopathy/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Thus, it remains unclear how changes in the fibronectin gene result in glomerular fibronectin deposition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fibronectin glomerulopathy is rare. The disorder has a slight male predominance and has been described mainly in Caucasians and Asians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibronectin-glomerulopathy/abstract/19-21,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21,27</a>]. Cases in black or Hispanic patients have yet to be reported.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fibronectin glomerulopathy is characterized clinically by varying degrees of proteinuria, which is typically first seen between the ages of 20 and 40 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibronectin-glomerulopathy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This is followed, over the next 15 to 20 years, by hypertension, microscopic hematuria, and, in most patients, slow progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Complement levels are normal. Fibronectin glomerulopathy is rarely rapidly progressive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibronectin-glomerulopathy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>In one of the largest studies, the clinical features of 23 affected patients were reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibronectin-glomerulopathy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Eight of 16 in whom a 24-hour urine specimen was obtained at the time of diagnostic biopsy had more than 3 g of proteinuria. Microscopic hematuria and hypertension were observed in 12 and 10 patients, respectively. The mean plasma creatinine measured at the time of biopsy in 16 patients was 1.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (97.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span>. Among the patients in whom follow-up was available, four patients had normal renal function, six had slowly progressive renal insufficiency, five were undergoing dialysis (range from time of biopsy was 2 to 13 years), and four had received a renal allograft.</p><p>There also may be an association with hyperkalemic distal renal tubular acidosis (distal RTA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibronectin-glomerulopathy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hypoaldosteronism-type-4-rta\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of hypoaldosteronism (type 4 RTA)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOPATHOLOGIC FINDINGS AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first histologic examinations of fibronectin glomerulopathy described enlarged glomeruli with minimal hypercellularity and the presence of large deposits in the glomerular capillaries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibronectin-glomerulopathy/abstract/15,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,29,30</a>]. In a patient with an appropriate clinical presentation, a family history of kidney disease, and histologic features as described in the ensuing sections, immunohistochemistry showing staining for fibronectin in the mesangium and along the capillary walls confirms the diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Light microscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Light microscopy shows glomerular enlargement and usually some evidence of minimal cellular proliferation, producing a lobular or clover-like appearance that may be confused with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN). The glomerular capillary walls may be thickened and the mesangium greatly expanded by acellular periodic acid-Schiff-positive (PAS-positive) homogeneous material that can result in severely narrowed capillary lumina. Staining with Congo red or methenamine silver is consistently negative (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F86699\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86699 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>There is no consistent specific tubulointerstitial compartment abnormality. However, interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy become more prominent over time, a common finding in progressive renal disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Electron microscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electron microscopy typically reveals large to massive nondescript electron-dense subendothelial and mesangial deposits. The deposits have been described as finely granular or fibrillar in some cases. If fibrillar, the fibrils are approximately 12 nm in width and 125 nm in length and are typically arranged in an irregular fashion. These fibrils are slightly wider than those seen in amyloid (8 to 10 nm). However, they are thinner than the fibrils in fibrillary glomerulonephritis (18 to 22 nm) and the microtubules of immunotactoid glomerulopathy (greater than 30 nm) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F86700\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86700 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibronectin-glomerulopathy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunofluorescence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunoglobulin and complement component staining is absent or weak in fibronectin glomerulopathy. Immunohistochemistry examination showing staining for fibronectin in the mesangium and along the capillary walls confirms the diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F88601\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef88601 \">picture 3</a>). It is the plasma isoform of fibronectin that stains most intensely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibronectin-glomerulopathy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal treatment for fibronectin glomerulopathy is uncertain. There are no data regarding the use of immunomodulating agents, plasmapheresis, or any other specific therapy aimed at the underlying disease.</p><p>The most appropriate option is probably the use of nonspecific treatment methods intended to prolong adequate renal function. This includes strict control of the blood pressure and proteinuria, usually with the administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs).
