Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia is a clinicopathologic entity associated with an IgM monoclonal gammopathy in the blood that is virtually always a manifestation of LPL.

The incidence is approximately 10-fold lower in Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-lymphoplasmacytic-lymphoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The vast majority of patients are Caucasian with other ethnic groups accounting for approximately 5 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-lymphoplasmacytic-lymphoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The median age is 65 years and 50 to 60 percent of patients are male.</p><p>The majority of patients with LPL have a circulating monoclonal IgM that can lead to a hyperviscosity syndrome known as Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia (WM). Although LPL appears to be a sporadic disease in the majority of cases, a familial predisposition is present in some cases. The epidemiology of LPL and WM is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-waldenstrom-macroglobulinemia#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>Occasional cases classified as LPL demonstrate a mixed (type II) cryoglobulinemia and concurrent hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-lymphoplasmacytic-lymphoma/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. However, many such cases may in fact fall into the diagnostic category of splenic marginal zone lymphoma, which has also been associated with hepatitis C infection and may be accompanied by paraproteinemia. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Marginal zone lymphoma'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H198194648\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The postulated normal counterpart to the malignant cell in LPL is a peripheral B lymphocyte stimulated to differentiate to a plasma cell, possibly corresponding to the primary immune response to antigen, or to a post germinal center cell that has undergone somatic mutation but not heavy chain class switch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-lymphoplasmacytic-lymphoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Gene expression profiling studies reveal a phenotype more similar to chronic lymphocytic leukemia than multiple myeloma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-lymphoplasmacytic-lymphoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The pathogenesis of LPL is incompletely understood. One report found that 13 of 14 tumors studied had evidence of somatic hypermutation of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene, without intraclonal variation, suggesting that the cell of origin is a post-germinal center B cell that has undergone affinity maturation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-lymphoplasmacytic-lymphoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Several other studies have found that chromosomal rearrangements involving the IgH locus are uncommon in LPL. However, deletions of 6q21 have been identified in 40 to 60 percent of patients with Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-lymphoplasmacytic-lymphoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The target gene(s) at this site have not yet been identified, but this is a common site of chromosome loss in many different B cell lymphomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-lymphoplasmacytic-lymphoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>In one study that performed whole genome <span class=\"nowrap\">germline/tumor</span> sequencing in 30 patients with Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia, highly recurrent mutations were found in the following genes: MYD88 (90 percent), CXCR4 (27 percent), and ARID1A (17 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-lymphoplasmacytic-lymphoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Mutations in CXCR4 were similar to those seen in patients with the <strong>w</strong>arts, <strong>h</strong>ypogammaglobulinemia, <strong>i</strong>nfection, and <strong>m</strong>yelokathexis (WHIM) syndrome. Copy number alterations resulted in previously unidentified genetic losses in additional genes. Further evaluation revealed that the somatic mutation status defined groups of tumors associated with different clinical presentations and survival rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-lymphoplasmacytic-lymphoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Those with both MYD88 mutations and nonsense mutations in CXCR4 were more likely to present with hyperviscosity and bone marrow involvement. In contrast, patients without mutations in either MYD88 or CXCR4 were less likely to present with hyperviscosity or bone marrow involvement, and had a significantly shorter median overall survival than those with either or both mutations. Details regarding MYD88 are presented in the following section.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9628277\"><span class=\"h2\">MYD88 mutations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MYD88 is a molecule that plays a part in toll-like receptor and interleukin-1 receptor signaling leading to enhanced B cell survival. An activating point mutation of MYD88 (MYD88 L265P) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of LPL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-lymphoplasmacytic-lymphoma/abstract/17,19-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,19-23</a>]. In LPL cells with the MYD88 L265P mutation, MYD88 complexes with Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) to promote tumor survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-lymphoplasmacytic-lymphoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, genome-wide massively parallel sequencing of bone marrow LPL cells and paired normal cells from the same patient identified MYD88 L265P mutations in 10 of 10 patients with LPL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-lymphoplasmacytic-lymphoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Sequencing of this gene in additional patients revealed the MYD88 L265P mutation in 49 of 54 patients with WM and three of three patients with non-IgM-secreting LPL. This mutation was absent in the paired normal tissue samples and in B cells from 10 healthy donors and 10 patients with multiple myeloma. The MYD88 L265P mutation was also significantly less common in patients with marginal zone lymphoma (7 percent), or IgM monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (10 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A subsequent study reported the MYD88 L265P mutation in 18 of 27 cases of <span class=\"nowrap\">WM/LPL</span> (67 percent), 2 of 28 cases of extranodal marginal zone lymphoma (7 percent), 2 of 53 cases of splenic marginal zone lymphoma (4 percent), and none of 11 cases of nodal marginal zone lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-lymphoplasmacytic-lymphoma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A third study identified the MYD88 L265P mutation in 97 of 104 cases of WM (93 percent) and in 13 of 24 cases of IgM MGUS (54 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-lymphoplasmacytic-lymphoma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In contrast, this mutation was only found in 2 of 20 cases of splenic marginal zone lymphoma, 1 of 26 cases of chronic lymphocytic lymphoma, and none of the cases of multiple myeloma, IgG MGUS, or healthy donors.</p><p/><p>Together, these findings suggest that MYD88 mutations have a central role in the pathogenesis of LPL. MYD88 augments Toll-like receptor signaling, thereby leading to the activation of transcription factors of the NF-kB family, which have been linked to the growth and survival of both normal and neoplastic B cells. As already noted, MYD88 also appears to augment signaling by BTK, an important component of the B cell receptor signaling pathway that also promotes B cell survival and growth. Although highly associated with LPL, MYD88 mutations are not entirely specific; they have also been reported in a subset of diffuse large B cell lymphomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-lymphoplasmacytic-lymphoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] and, as noted above, also occur in a subset of other plasma cell dyscrasias (eg, IgM MGUS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-lymphoplasmacytic-lymphoma/abstract/21,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,26</a>] and low-grade B cell lymphoproliferative disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-lymphoplasmacytic-lymphoma/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].<em> </em></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation of patients with LPL is varied and can include symptoms related to tumor infiltration (lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, cytopenias) or monoclonal protein production (hyperviscosity, neuropathy). Approximately one-third of patients are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-lymphoplasmacytic-lymphoma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The most common presenting features include weakness and fatigue, often due to anemia. Up to one-quarter of patients display systemic B symptoms (ie, fever, night sweats, weight loss) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-lymphoplasmacytic-lymphoma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

A monoclonal serum IgM (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F61928\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61928 \">figure 1</a>) is the most common subtype and confers a diagnosis of the clinical syndrome Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia (WM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-lymphoplasmacytic-lymphoma/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Less commonly, the tumor produces other immunoglobulins, a combination of immunoglobulins (ie, IgM and IgG), mixed cryoglobulins, or gamma heavy chains. As mentioned earlier, most cases with mixed cryoglobulinemia are related to concurrent hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-lymphoplasmacytic-lymphoma/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].

Some cases may also contain large, immunoblast-like cells. Sinuses are often open, and may contain histiocytes reacting to secreted periodic acid Schiff (PAS) positive immunoglobulin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F73998\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73998 \">picture 4</a>). Typical characteristics include Dutcher and Russell bodies, mast cells, and hemosiderin-laden macrophages. Rarely, numerous non-caseating granulomas of uncertain etiology may be seen. In some instances, they may be so numerous that the underlying lymphoma is inconspicuous and overlooked. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Bone marrow'</a> above.)</p><p>Of importance, proliferation centers, the hallmark of chronic lymphocytic <span class=\"nowrap\">leukemia/small</span> lymphocytic leukemia, are absent, as is paler-appearing marginal zone differentiation, which is seen in marginal zone lymphoma.

The majority express lymphocyte function associated antigen 1 (LFA-1). Adhesion molecules expressed on approximately half of these tumors include L-selectin, ICAM-1, CD44 and CD11c. The cells are variable in their expression of CD43; CD25 or CD11c may be faintly positive in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-lymphoplasmacytic-lymphoma/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>].

Characteristics useful in distinguishing LPL from CLL include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral blood involvement in LPL is usually less prominent than in CLL, but on rare occasions &ldquo;leukemic&rdquo; presentations are seen. Circulating malignant cells in LPL often have a plasmacytoid appearance whereas those in CLL resemble mature lymphocytes mixed with variable numbers of so-called prolymphocytes, larger cells with single distinct nucleoli.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The bone marrow infiltrate of LPL is usually less extensive than that of CLL, and, unlike CLL, contains a mixture of small lymphocytes, plasma cells, and plasmacytoid cells, and lacks prolymphocytes and proliferation centers. Frequent reactive mast cells are also characteristic of LPL, but are sometimes seen in CLL as well.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymph node involvement in LPL lacks proliferation centers that are pathognomonic of <span class=\"nowrap\">CLL/SLL</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The immunophenotype of LPL is notable for the lack of CD23, the presence of strong staining for surface IgM and CD20, and the presence of cytoplasmic Ig. Most cases of LPL lack expression of CD5, which is expressed in CLL.

Symptoms related to hyperviscosity are uncommon. In contrast to LPL, classical multiple myeloma with an IgM paraprotein is rare, comprising less than 1 percent of patients.</p><p>Often, LPL can be distinguished from multiple myeloma by the absence of CD56 and the presence of a substantial small lymphocytic component that expresses a clonal surface immunoglobulin. In difficult cases, one may have to rely on the differences in clinical presentation to exclude multiple myeloma. For example, a diagnosis of IgM multiple myeloma is preferred over a diagnosis of LPL if lytic bone lesions are present with or without hypercalcemia. Symptoms of hyperviscosity, and the presence of lymphadenopathy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> splenomegaly favor a diagnosis of LPL.

MCL tumor cells are typically CD5+ and CD23-; the vast majority overexpress cyclin D1 protein, which can be identified by immunohistochemistry. The t(11;14) translocation involving the cyclin D1 gene (CCDN1) is seen in a little over half of MCL by conventional cytogenetics, but in a much higher percentage of cases tested with FISH. This translocation also is seen in some cases of multiple myeloma, but not in LPL.

The immunophenotype is also similar with MZL cells expressing B cell markers CD19, CD20, and CD22, and not CD5, CD10, and CD23. Chromosomal abnormalities, usually trisomy 3 or t(11;18), are found in most cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-extranodal-marginal-zone-lymphoma-of-mucosa-associated-lymphoid-tissue-malt\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Unlike LPL, MZL often has a population of cells with abundant pale cytoplasm (so-called monocytoid B cells) that is indicative of marginal zone-type differentiation. In addition, patients with MZL are more likely to demonstrate mixed cryoglobulinemia and hepatitis C infection. However, given the similar histology and immunophenotype, it can be difficult to differentiate between LPL and MZL. While MZL may be associated with an IgM paraprotein, the level of IgM is typically less than 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> whereas most cases of LPL have IgM paraprotein levels that exceed 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>. Testing for MYD88 mutation is being done at some centers and can also be useful, although as already discussed it is not an absolute discriminator, as a small minority of MZL has MYD88 mutations. In some difficult cases, &quot;small B cell lymphoma with plasmacytic differentiation&quot; followed by a differential diagnosis including LPL and MZL may be the most accurate classification.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Follicular lymphoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On rare occasions, follicular lymphoma (FL) can demonstrate a diffuse growth pattern and exhibit some degree of plasmacytic differentiation. In contrast to FL, LPL is CD10 negative and is not associated with translocations involving BCL-2, which are seen in most follicular lymphomas.
