The quality of the specimens submitted to the microbiology laboratory is critical for optimal specimen evaluation.</p><p>The general techniques of specimen collection and handling that have been established both to maximize the yield of organisms and isolate relevant pathogens from specimens obtained from different body sites will be reviewed here (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F78605%7EID%2F54592%7EID%2F67280%7EID%2F82682\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78605 graphicRef54592 graphicRef67280 graphicRef82682 \">table 1A-D</a>). The techniques of collecting specific specimens such as blood, sputum, and urine are discussed in more detail separately.

As a result, care must be taken to collect only those specimens that may yield pathogens, rather than colonizing flora or contaminants. Specific rules for the collection of material vary, depending upon the source of the specimen, but several general principles apply [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-specimen-collection-and-transport/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make every effort to obtain specimens prior to the initiation of antimicrobial therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear gloves, gowns, masks, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> goggles, when appropriate, when collecting specimens from sterile sites. Use strict aseptic technique.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When obtaining specimens from normally sterile sites such as pleural or joint spaces, cerebrospinal fluid, or the peritoneum, take care to minimize contamination by the normal colonizing flora of the skin or mucous membranes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Collect an adequate volume of specimen; send tissue or fluid whenever possible rather than submitting a specimen collected on a swab.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the specimen is collected in a syringe, remove the needle and replace it with a cap prior to transport.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Label all specimen containers with identifying information about the patient (name and hospital number or birth date) and the specimen source, date, and time of collection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete all paper or electronic requisitions completely and precisely, including requested details on patient history, antimicrobial therapy, and specimen source, so that the laboratory can best determine the appropriate method for processing the specimen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Notify the laboratory in advance if special tests are requested or if unusual pathogens, including potential agents of bioterrorism, are suspected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Place warning labels on specimens from patients suspected of having highly contagious diseases and notify the laboratory supervisor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coordinate the processing of specimens that are being submitted for both microbiologic and pathologic evaluations. It is often better to send a single specimen to the laboratory and to have it divided there by an experienced pathologist rather than submitting separate specimens. If a single sample is submitted, it must not be placed in the preservatives routinely used for pathology specimens (eg, formalin) until a portion is separated for culture.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If there is any question about the optimal sample to collect, call the microbiology laboratory before obtaining specimens.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIMEN TRANSPORT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, specimens may be sent to the microbiology laboratory in sterile, leak-proof containers enclosed within leak-proof, sealed plastic bags. In the case of fluids obtained in syringes (eg, paracentesis, joint aspirate, needle drainage of abscess), most organisms remain viable for significant periods of time in the syringe used for collection. It has long been advocated that these specimens be sent in the original syringe. However, in the era of universal precautions, some laboratories encourage transfer of the material to another container prior to transport, while others recommend transport in the original syringe after the needle is removed and replaced with a cap. In our institution, the microbiology laboratory prefers to receive specimens in the original syringe as long as the needle has been replaced with a cap but will also accept specimens in other containers.</p><p>Prompt transport of specimens to the microbiology laboratory is essential in order to optimize the yield of cultures and the interpretation of results. Delays in processing may result in the overgrowth of some microorganisms or the death of more fastidious ones. Desiccation of the sample must also be avoided.</p><p>Samples for bacterial culture should ideally arrive in the microbiology laboratory within one to two hours of collection. If a delay is unavoidable, most specimens (with the exception of blood, cerebrospinal fluid, joint fluid, and cultures for <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em>) should be refrigerated until transported. It is important to add that refrigeration should occur in a refrigerator approved for specimen collection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Specimen rejection by the laboratory</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common reasons for rejection of specimens by microbiology laboratories include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unlabeled specimens</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inconsistent information on the requisition and the specimen label (eg, different patient names)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specimen received in a leaking or broken container</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specimens received in syringes with the needle in place &ndash; These pose a danger to the microbiology lab staff; if, after discussion with the responsible physician, the specimen is considered vitally important and the source cannot be sampled again, the physician is asked to come to the laboratory and remove the needle before the technologist processes the specimen</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specimen obviously contaminated</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inappropriate test request based upon the source of the specimen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F78605%7EID%2F54592%7EID%2F67280%7EID%2F82682\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78605 graphicRef54592 graphicRef67280 graphicRef82682 \">table 1A-D</a>) or clinical situation (eg, request for a stool culture for enteric pathogens in a patient hospitalized for more than three days)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inappropriate transport medium for the requested test (eg, anaerobic cultures requested for specimen submitted in aerobic transport media)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insufficient quantity of specimen</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specimen transported at an inappropriate temperature</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolonged specimen transport time</p><p/><p>It is important that the microbiology laboratory notify the responsible physician promptly when a specimen is rejected so that appropriate measures can be taken to obtain more material. If there is a labeling problem, the person responsible for collecting the specimen may be able to rectify the paperwork error. In situations in which obtaining another specimen is not feasible (eg, surgical or other invasive procedure required to obtain the original specimen), the laboratory may have to proceed with specimen processing, even though the validity of the results may be compromised. Such decisions typically are made in collaboration with the patient's physician, and laboratory reports usually are accompanied by a disclaimer.</p><p>Examples of specimens that are unsuitable for culture include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-specimen-collection-and-transport/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swabs of decubitus ulcer, perirectal abscess, periodontal lesion, burn wound, gangrenous ulcer &ndash; Submit aspirate or tissue instead</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomitus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Colostomy discharge</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Foley catheter tip</p><p/><p>In addition, some laboratories, including our own, no longer perform cultures of intravenous catheter tips, based on lack of utility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-specimen-collection-and-transport/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].
