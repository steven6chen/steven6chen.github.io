The approach to an infant or newborn with hypotonia or weakness is discussed separately.

Weakness may arise from any portion of the motor unit and is typically divided into upper motor neuron and lower motor neuron weakness as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Upper motor neuron weakness</strong> &ndash; Upper motor neuron weakness arises from lesions in the cerebral cortex and corticospinal tracts down to, but not including, the anterior horn cell in the dorsal spinal cord.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lower motor neuron weakness</strong> &ndash; Lower motor neuron weakness results from lesions located in the anterior horn cell, peripheral nerve, neuromuscular junction, or muscle.</p><p/><p>Weakness can be confused with hypotonia or ataxia. Hypotonia is a decreased resistance to passive range of motion. Ataxia refers to decreased muscular coordination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-infant-with-hypotonia-and-weakness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the infant with hypotonia and weakness&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-acute-ataxia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with acute ataxia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES OF ACUTE WEAKNESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The causes of acute weakness are provided in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81649\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81649 \">table 1</a>). Many of the conditions that cause acute muscle weakness are potentially life-threatening. Mortality due to acute muscle weakness is typically caused by respiratory failure or by lesions in the brain that cause both weakness and increased intracranial pressure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H406513698\"><span class=\"h2\">Upper motor neuron lesion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with acute upper motor neuron lesions may initially present with altered mental status and focal neurologic findings such as unequal pupils, visual field defects, cranial nerve palsies, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> paralysis on the opposite side of the central nervous system lesion. During the acute phase, upper motor neuron lesions are associated with decreased spinal cord reflexes and hypotonia. Over the period of several weeks, spasticity, hyperreflexia, and &quot;upper motor neuron&quot; signs (eg, positive Babinski sign) develop.</p><p>In pediatric patients, it is important to emphasize that classic distal upper motor neuron findings are often not present during the early phases of illness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Cerebral cortex</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h4\">Intracranial hemorrhage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traumatic epidural or subdural hematoma occurs in children who have sustained severe head trauma (Glasgow Coma Scale &lt;9 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59662\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59662 \">table 2</a>)) but may also be present in pediatric patients who are less symptomatic, especially in infants with open fontanelles in whom intracranial pressure may increase more gradually. In addition to altered mental status, patients often display findings of increased intracranial pressure (eg, vomiting, tachycardia or bradycardia, increased blood pressure, and focal neurologic signs). The diagnosis of intracranial hemorrhage usually includes demonstration of intracranial hemorrhage on neuroimaging. The presence of intracranial hemorrhage without a clear history of trauma is suggestive of abusive head trauma, an underlying bleeding disorder, or acute stroke. The approach to pediatric patients with severe head trauma, subdural hematoma, and epidural hematoma are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-traumatic-brain-injury-in-children-initial-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe traumatic brain injury in children: Initial evaluation and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-children-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intracranial epidural hematoma in children: Clinical features, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intracranial-subdural-hematoma-in-children-clinical-features-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intracranial subdural hematoma in children: Clinical features, evaluation, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Less commonly, rupture of a preexisting arteriovenous malformation or aneurysm may cause subarachnoid hemorrhage. Most of these patients are asymptomatic prior to rupture. These children present with severe headache which is often associated with sudden weakness and altered mental status. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h4\">Stroke</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stroke is a rare cause of weakness in children. Infants with stroke may present with focal weakness, but are more likely than older children to present with seizures and altered mental status. Older children usually have hemiparesis or other focal neurologic signs such as aphasia, visual disturbance, or cerebellar signs, although seizures, headache, and lethargy are not uncommon. Neck pain can be associated with cervical artery dissection, and a Horner's syndrome may accompany carotid dissection. Neuroimaging confirms the diagnosis. Common preexisting medical issues contributing to stroke in children and adolescents include sickle cell disease and structural cardiac abnormalities.</p><p>The etiology, clinical features and management of stroke in children is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ischemic-stroke-in-children-and-young-adults-etiology-and-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ischemic stroke in children and young adults: Etiology and clinical features&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ischemic-stroke-in-children-evaluation-initial-management-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ischemic stroke in children: Evaluation, initial management, and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h4\">Brain tumor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intracranial tumors, either malignant or benign, may cause weakness in addition to many other clinical findings that vary according to whether the fontanelles are closed and the location of the tumor. Intracranial tumors can present with or be exacerbated by hemorrhage into the tumor. These patients usually either have a history of known brain tumor or a history of clumsiness, weakness, behavioral changes, and vomiting. When the acute hemorrhage occurs, symptoms include weakness, severe headache, and vomiting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-central-nervous-system-tumors-in-children#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of central nervous system tumors in children&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h4\">Seizure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Todd paralysis is a temporary focal weakness (eg, hemiparesis) following a seizure. It generally improves rapidly during the postictal period with resolution in minutes to hours. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical and laboratory diagnosis of seizures in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Behavior after the event'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h4\">Hemiplegic migraine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A typical migrainous aura is characterized by progressive neurologic deficits or disturbances with subsequent complete recovery. Visual disturbances are the most common type of aura. However, auras may also involve other senses or occasionally cause motor or speech deficits. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-migraine-in-children#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of migraine in children&quot;, section on 'Migraine with aura'</a>.)</p><p>Hemiplegic migraine is manifested by motor and sensory symptoms that are unilateral. These symptoms can last longer than the headache itself. Complete recovery may take weeks in some cases; permanent weakness can occur after multiple attacks. Hemiplegic migraine is divided into familial and sporadic subtypes. Familial hemiplegic migraine is an uncommon autosomal dominant disorder linked to specific gene mutations. In addition, there are some patients who are the first member of their family to have hemiplegic migraine. They are referred to as having spontaneous hemiplegic migraine and may or may not carry one of the described gene variants. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemiplegic-migraine\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemiplegic migraine&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h4\">Alternating hemiplegia of childhood</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This very rare condition is characterized by periodic episodes of hemiplegia or quadriplegia beginning in infancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-the-child-with-weakness/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Other findings include paroxysmal eye movements (eg, nystagmus), seizures, cognitive impairment, and ataxia. Episodes often improve or resolve after sleep. A family history of migraine may also be present. The diagnosis is made based upon the clinical findings and excluding brain abnormalities by neuroimaging. These patients warrant prompt referral to a pediatric neurologist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Spinal cord</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h4\">Spinal cord trauma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traumatic injuries may damage the spinal cord, either transiently or permanently. The cervical spine is the most frequent site of injury. Clinical features vary according to the degree of cord injury and the level of the injury. Patients may demonstrate spinal shock with bradycardia and hypotension. Associated brain and systemic injuries (eg, hemothorax, extremity fractures, and intraabdominal injury) are common. The initial stabilization, evaluation, and treatment are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute traumatic spinal cord injury&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spine-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and acute management of cervical spine injuries in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Spinal cord concussion may occur after a direct blow to the head, neck, or back and presents with impairment of sensory and motor function below the level of the injury. Patients with this injury generally recover, often within hours. Other traumatic injuries include spinal epidural hematoma, vertebral column fractures or dislocations, and spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality (SCIWORA). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-cord-injury-without-radiographic-abnormality-sciwora-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality (SCIWORA) in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h4\">Spinal cord tumor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Focal weakness and peripheral or back pain are the most common presenting symptoms of a spinal cord tumor. Incontinence may also occur. Neuroimaging, typically magnetic resonance imaging for the appropriate spinal level establishes the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-central-nervous-system-tumors-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of central nervous system tumors in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h4\">Paraspinal infection or inflammation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epidural abscess and discitis are rare causes of weakness in children. Children with epidural abscess may display the classic diagnostic triad of fever, spinal pain, and neurologic deficits, but only a few patients have all three components at presentation. Over time, an untreated epidural abscess is associated with a typical progression of symptoms from back pain (often focal and severe), to root pain (described as &quot;shooting&quot; or &quot;electric shocks&quot;), to neurologic deficits (motor weakness, sensory changes, and bowel and bladder dysfunction), and finally paralysis, which may quickly become irreversible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-epidural-abscess#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal epidural abscess&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Discitis refers to inflammation of the intervertebral disc. Most patients with discitis are under three years of age and complain of back pain, with or without fever, but rarely, the infection may spread to the epidural space and cause weakness. The etiology is controversial. The current consensus, backed by scant supportive evidence, is that discitis in children usually represents low-grade infection and is on one end of the spectrum of vertebral osteomyelitis. Although disc biopsy is not necessary for diagnosis, when it is performed, as many as 60 percent of tissue samples grow bacteria, usually Staphylococcus aureus. However, children often recover without antibiotic therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=back-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-causes#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Back pain in children and adolescents: Causes&quot;, section on 'Discitis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h4\">Transverse myelitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transverse myelitis is an inflammatory condition of unclear etiology. Symptoms are characterized by motor and sensory deficits attributable to myelin destruction in one or both sides of the spinal cord. They include pain, weakness, paresthesias, and sphincter dysfunction. These typically present over a few days, with paresthesias preceding the weakness and urinary retention. A hyperacute presentation sometimes occurs with a rapid onset of paraplegia, sensory abnormalities, and urinary retention. This form is often associated with significant back pain. A discrete sensory level may or may not be detected with either presentation. A thoracic sensory level is frequently found in children. Diagnosis is made based upon clinical criteria and is confirmed by characteristic findings of transverse myelitis on magnetic resonance imaging. The clinical features and diagnosis of transverse myelitis is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transverse-myelitis#H190496510\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transverse myelitis&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transverse-myelitis#H12689889\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transverse myelitis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H406513809\"><span class=\"h2\">Lower motor neuron lesion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with lower motor neuron weakness typically display muscle weakness, hypotonia, fasciculations, and decreased spinal cord reflexes. Mental status is typically, but not always preserved depending upon the cause and whether respiratory failure has occurred.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Anterior horn cell disease</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h4\">Poliomyelitis and other enteroviruses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although polio no longer poses the public health threat in the United States and other developed countries that it once did, areas of endemic wild-type poliovirus still exist in other parts of the world. Poliovirus is a species of human enterovirus. A small fraction of patients with poliovirus infection develop central nervous system (CNS) infection. After invading the CNS, the virus uncoats, viral replication occurs, and the motor neuron dies, leading to paralysis of muscle fibers supplied by this motor neuron. Weakness may vary from one muscle or group of muscles, to quadriplegia, and respiratory failure. Tone is reduced, nearly always in an asymmetric manner. Proximal muscles usually are affected more than distal ones, and legs more commonly than arms. Reflexes are decreased or absent. The sensory examination is normal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polio-and-infectious-diseases-of-the-anterior-horn#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Polio and infectious diseases of the anterior horn&quot;, section on 'Poliovirus and poliomyelitis'</a>.)</p><p>Sporadic cases of acute paralysis similar to paralytic poliomyelitis also occur with other enterovirus serotypes, the most important of which is enterovirus A71. Large outbreaks of paralytic disease associated with enterovirus A71 involving hundreds of cases, mostly in children less than six years old have been reported from eastern Europe and Russia, and more recently in Taiwan, Thailand, and China. Some children have presented with brainstem encephalitis, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and a rapidly fatal course. Enterovirus D68 has also been implicated in rare cases of acute paralysis in the United States.

Less commonly, patients can present with primarily sensory dysfunction or ophthalmoplegia, ataxia and bulbar dysfunction (Miller-Fisher Syndrome). If weakness progresses, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation may occur.

It is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from a partial deficiency of porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD) activity, the third enzyme in the pathway of heme synthesis. The neuropathic symptoms most commonly involve muscle weakness with more involvement of proximal muscle groups. Symptoms generally begin after puberty and may be triggered by stress, decreased food intake, a number of different medications (eg, barbiturates, sulfonamides, estrogen, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=griseofulvin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">griseofulvin</a>) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F57422\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57422 \">table 3</a>), and, in women, menses.

The toxin is produced by the Clostridium botulinum bacterium, a soil-dwelling, gram-positive anaerobe. There are three main presentations of botulism: foodborne, wound-associated, and most commonly, infant botulism. Classic, or foodborne botulism, is caused by eating food contaminated by clostridial toxin. Symptoms include vision changes, difficulty swallowing, and, ultimately, progressive weakness. Wound botulism presents similarly to classic botulism but the toxin arises from a grossly infected wound. In infant botulism, the bacteria are ingested and produce toxin within the child's gastrointestinal tract. Infants with botulism present with constipation, lethargy, and poor tone. Honey, which can be contaminated with C botulinum spores, has been associated with infant botulism. Infant botulism, although rare, is one of the most common causes of acute, generalized weakness in infants.

Most commonly, it presents in a slowly progressive fashion. However, myasthenic crises can occur, which can lead to respiratory failure. The most common symptoms of myasthenia gravis include ptosis and diplopia. These symptoms are generally exacerbated by activity and relieved by rest. Transient neonatal myasthenia affects 10 to 15 percent of babies born to mothers with myasthenia gravis. It can lead to weakness, dysphagia, and occasionally, respiratory distress or failure.

Neurotoxicity is characterized initially by ptosis, diplopia, and bulbar palsy with onset between 1 to 10 hours following envenomation. Symptoms can later progress to dysarthria and more generalized weakness. As a result, frequent, serial observations for ptosis, diplopia, and impaired swallowing function are of paramount importance. Ventilatory support may be required for airway protection or respiratory paralysis.

Although many viruses can cause myositis, it is most commonly due to infection with influenza (benign acute childhood myositis), which rarely progresses to rhabdomyolysis. This condition is characterized by refusal to walk with marked tenderness of bilateral calf muscles and pain on passive or active dorsiflexion of the feet in a child who is in the recovery phase of influenza. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-viral-myositis#H3830156751\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of viral myositis&quot;, section on 'Benign acute childhood myositis'</a>.)</p><p>The course of acute viral myositis complicated by massive rhabdomyolysis is highly variable, and relates to the course of the complications of rhabdomyolysis, including renal failure, fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, and cardiac arrhythmias. Other complications that can occur include respiratory failure secondary to respiratory muscle necrosis and weakness, infection, and pulmonary embolus. In most cases, with prompt recognition and appropriate directed therapy, muscle strength and renal function recover fully, usually within one to two weeks of the onset of rhabdomyolysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-viral-myositis#H3830156751\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of viral myositis&quot;, section on 'Benign acute childhood myositis'</a>.)</p><p>Pyomyositis is a purulent infection of skeletal muscle that arises from hematogenous spread, usually with abscess formation. In healthy children, it is most commonly seen in tropical regions. Patients with pyomyositis in temperate zones more frequently are immunocompromised.</p><p>Pyomyositis presents with fever and pain with cramping localized to a single muscle group. The disease occurs most often in the lower extremity (sites include the thigh, calf and gluteal muscles), but any muscle group can be involved, including the iliopsoas, pelvic, trunk, paraspinal, and upper extremity muscles. Multifocal infection with involvement of more than one muscle group may be observed in up to 20 percent of cases.

Approximately one week after eating the tainted meat, larvae enter skeletal muscles causing muscle pain, tenderness, swelling, and weakness. The pain can be so extreme as to limit all movement, including breathing or moving the tongue. High fever lasting a number of weeks is often seen and laboratory evaluation often reveals a marked eosinophilia.

In addition chronic inhalant drug abuse with toluene containing agents, ingestion of sedative-hypnotics, muscle relaxants (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclobenzaprine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cyclobenzaprine</a>), opioids, or drugs that can cause rhabdomyolysis (eg, amphetamines, phencyclidine) may cause significant muscle weakness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H39\"><span class=\"h2\">Conversion disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conversion disorder is defined as a symptom or deficit in voluntary motor function in patients without an anatomic or physiologic basis. In children, conversion disorder occurs more commonly in girls than boys and is most prevalent in children between the age of 10 to 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-the-child-with-weakness/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Risk factors include prior sexual abuse and preexisting psychiatric disease (eg, anxiety, depression).

Key findings include reciprocal contraction during attempts to move apparently paralyzed muscle groups (ie, contraction of both agonist and antagonist muscles such as the biceps and triceps during strength training), presence of normal tendon reflexes in flaccid extremities, give-way weakness, or physically implausible presentations (eg, triparesis).

These include Erb palsy, congenital neuropathies, anterior horn cell disorders (eg, spinal muscular atrophy), congenital myopathies, muscular dystrophy, and inborn errors of metabolism.

(See appropriate topic reviews).</p><p>Congenital hypothyroidism remains an important cause of muscle weakness in infants in many parts of the world. The Kocher-Debre-Semelaigne syndrome describes infants with typical features of cretinism associated with diffuse muscular hypertrophy and muscle weakness that is predominantly proximal. These infants have motor and cognitive developmental delay, constipation, myxedema, enlarged tongue, and coarse hair and skin typical of cretinism. Despite a very muscular, almost muscle-bound appearance, they are in fact weak and often have difficulty with sitting and head control. Where implemented, neonatal screening has markedly reduced the number of infants with florid hypothyroidism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypothyroid-myopathy#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypothyroid myopathy&quot;, section on 'Congenital hypothyroidism'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and detection of congenital hypothyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Cushing syndrome is another important and potentially reversible endocrine cause of chronic muscle weakness. In children, Cushing's syndrome most commonly arises from exogenous steroid administration and is frequently accompanied by striae, centripetal obesity, a &quot;buffalo hump&quot;, steroid acne, and hypertension. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-cushings-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and clinical manifestations of Cushing's syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Chronic weakness may also rarely occur as a manifestation of a conversion disorder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H41\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27360371\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial stabilization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a child presenting with weakness, the clinician should first focus on the child's airway, breathing, and circulation. Many causes of weakness may lead to respiratory insufficiency and failure. Thus, the clinician should carefully assess respiratory effort, air movement, and pulse oximetry. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-assessment-and-stabilization-of-children-with-respiratory-or-circulatory-compromise\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial assessment and stabilization of children with respiratory or circulatory compromise&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The presence of Cushing's triad (bradycardia, hypertension, and irregular respirations) or altered mental status should prompt emergent evaluation for and treatment of increased intracranial pressure.

Subacute, chronic, or indolent presentations are more suggestive of transverse myelitis, neuropathies (eg, Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome) or myopathies (eg, muscular dystrophy). Weakness that worsens over the course of the day or preferentially affects the extraocular muscles is consistent with myasthenia gravis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Trauma</strong> &ndash; Weakness following trauma increases the concern for intracranial hemorrhage (eg, epidural hematoma) or spinal cord injury. Weakness immediately after birth would be concerning for nerve injury associated with childbirth (eg, Erb palsy).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Seizure</strong> &ndash; Weakness in association with a seizure may indicate acute intracranial hemorrhage or stroke, but may also be caused by a self-limited Todd paralysis. Often, the child has a prior history of seizures with Todd paralysis. In addition, Todd paralysis should resolve within a few hours of the seizure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Headache</strong> &ndash; Headache and weakness, especially in children with progressive morning vomiting or focal neurological signs, is highly suggestive of an intracranial mass lesion. Children with an intracranial hemorrhage or stroke may also experience rapid onset of a severe headache, often described as the worst of their life. Weakness that is followed by a migrainoid headache is seen in children with hemisyndrome migraine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neck or back pain</strong> &ndash; Patients with Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome, poliomyelitis, transverse myelitis, epidural spinal hematoma, or epidural spinal abscess often complain of neck or back pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fever</strong> &ndash; Fever is seen in patients with viral myositis, pyomyositis, and trichinellosis. In addition, a febrile illness may be a triggering stress in patients with acute intermittent porphyria.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Exercise-induced</strong> &ndash; Weakness associated with exercise is characteristic of patients with myasthenia gravis, periodic paralysis, rhabdomyolysis, and myotonic dystrophy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diet</strong> &ndash; Reef fish ingestion may lead to ciguatera poisoning. Paralytic shellfish poisoning occurs in patients who eat shellfish harvested from contaminated beds or during times of algae blooms known as red tides. Trichinellosis occurs in patients who consume undercooked pork or other contaminated meat (eg, wild bear meat). Outbreaks of food borne botulism usually involve consumption of home canned foods such as fruits, vegetables, and fish.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Constipation</strong> &ndash; In infants, a history of constipation and poor feeding with generalized weakness suggests infant botulism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dark urine</strong> &ndash; A history of dark red or brown urine should prompt consideration of rhabdomyolysis. Pigmenturia will be missed in rhabdomyolysis if the filtered load of myoglobin is insufficient or has largely resolved before the patient seeks medical attention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medications and toxins</strong> &ndash; The clinician should identify any potential exposures to heavy metals (eg, arsenic, mercury, thallium), organophosphates, or medications known to cause weakness, such as corticosteroids (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F69751\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69751 \">table 5</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H43\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient should undergo a complete physical examination with specific attention to muscle and neurologic findings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H44\"><span class=\"h3\">Muscle examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When evaluating a patient complaining of muscle weakness, the examiner should follow a systematic approach that includes inspection of muscle, palpation and percussion of muscle, assessment of tone and manual muscle strength testing, and assessment of motor function. Joint examination and neurologic examination, including testing of the deep tendon reflexes and sensory testing, are important adjuncts to the muscle examination. Evaluation of muscle weakness in the adult is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=muscle-examination-in-the-evaluation-of-weakness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Muscle examination in the evaluation of weakness&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inspection</strong> &ndash; Muscle atrophy indicates chronic muscle disuse or denervation. Hypertrophy occurs in patients with Becker and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Fasciculations suggest a lower motor neuron disorder (eg, spinal muscular atrophy). Ptosis is found in children with myasthenia gravis, botulism, and neurotoxic snake envenomation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Palpation and percussion</strong> &ndash; Muscle tenderness occurs in patients with myopathic weakness including those with myositis, trichinellosis, and rhabdomyolysis. Focal tenderness over the spine may be seen with epidural abscess or transverse myelitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tone and muscle strength testing in the infant</strong> &ndash; Tone is defined as the patient's passive resistance to movement. Tone in infants can be assessed by observing resistance of the upper or lower extremity as it is pulled by the examiner or by the pull-to-sit maneuver, in which the infant's hands are grasped and the baby is pulled from a supine to sitting position. The normal infant will offer some resistance, with flexion at the knees, elbows, and ankles. The head should move with the body and head lag should be minimal. Pronounced head lag may indicate hypotonia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Muscle strength also can be tested by holding the infant in a vertical position with the feet on a flat surface. A normal infant should be able to bear weight on the lower extremities while attempting to stand. In addition, infants with normal tone hold the wrist or ankle in line with the rest of the extremity. Strength is measured by examining the patient's active movement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Manual muscle strength testing in the older child</strong> &ndash; The Medical Research Council's grading system for muscle strength is widely used. The examiner assesses the patient's ability to move the muscle against resistance provided by the examiner who, through experience, has developed a sense of the expected range of normal motor function. This will vary from patient to patient depending upon the age of the subject (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F66888\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66888 \">table 7</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Decreased effort because of pain, fatigue, or malingering may be identified by &quot;give&quot; weakness in which there is initially a full effort followed by the abrupt loss of strength against resistance; this type of response does not occur in the truly weak individual. If intentionally decreased cooperation is suspected, observing the patient performing simple functional tasks such as sitting up from a supine position or toe or heel walking may reveal a discrepancy compared with the patient's performance on directed muscle strength testing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Muscle weakness patterns</strong> &ndash; The pattern of muscle weakness helps identify the underlying pathophysiology:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Generalized weakness is found in patients with myasthenia gravis, periodic paralysis, and organophosphate or carbamate poisoning, although some children with myasthenia gravis will have only ptosis or weakness confined to the cranial nerves.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Asymmetric weakness (paraplegia or hemiplegia) is seen in patients with intracranial tumor or hemorrhage, stroke, hemisyndrome migraine, spinal cord lesions, and Todd paralysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Symmetric weakness may be subdivided into proximal, distal, or regional weakness:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Proximal weakness is characteristic for muscle disorders such as rhabdomyolysis, viral myositis, congenital myopathies, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, dermatomyositis, acute intermittent porphyria, and anterior cord syndrome following trauma or spinal vascular injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Distal weakness suggests peripheral neuropathy (eg, Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome) or motor neuron disease, such as spinal motor atrophy or the congenital motor neuropathies (eg, juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Regional weakness may be found adjacent to the feeding female tick in patients with tick paralysis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H45\"><span class=\"h3\">Neurologic examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to motor function, children with muscle weakness warrant a complete neurologic assessment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=detailed-neurologic-assessment-of-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Detailed neurologic assessment of infants and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is important to differentiate between muscle weakness and ataxia. The difference is particularly difficult to discern when the presenting complaint is &quot;altered gait.&quot; In general, when movement abnormalities are due to weakness, they will be present regardless of patient position, type of movement or task. Although the differential diagnosis of ataxia and muscle weakness overlap, the approach may differ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-the-child-with-weakness/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Weakness may arise from any portion of the motor unit and is typically divided into upper motor neuron and lower motor neuron weakness. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The causes of acute weakness are provided in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81649\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81649 \">table 1</a>). Many of the conditions that cause acute muscle weakness are potentially life-threatening. Mortality due to acute muscle weakness is typically caused by respiratory failure or by lesions in the brain that cause both weakness and increased intracranial pressure. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Causes of acute weakness'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with acute upper motor neuron lesions may initially present with altered mental status and focal neurologic findings such as unequal pupils, visual field defects, cranial nerve palsies, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> paralysis on the opposite side of the central nervous system lesion. During the acute phase, upper motor neuron lesions are associated with decreased spinal cord reflexes and hypotonia. Over the period of several weeks, spasticity, hyperreflexia, and &quot;upper motor neuron&quot; signs (eg, positive Babinski sign) develop. (See <a href=\"#H406513698\" class=\"local\">'Upper motor neuron lesion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with lower motor neuron weakness typically display muscle weakness, hypotonia, fasciculations, and decreased spinal cord reflexes. Mental status is typically, but not always preserved depending upon the cause and whether respiratory failure has occurred. (See <a href=\"#H406513809\" class=\"local\">'Lower motor neuron lesion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Important causes of chronic weakness in children are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65108\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65108 \">table 6</a>). Of these, congenital hypothyroidism and Cushing syndrome are important conditions to recognize because the are reversible with prompt treatment. (See <a href=\"#H40\" class=\"local\">'Causes of chronic weakness'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial evaluation of a child with weakness should focus on the child's airway, breathing, and circulation with careful assessment of respiratory effort, air movement, and pulse oximetry. The presence of Cushing's triad (bradycardia, hypertension, and irregular respirations) or altered mental status should prompt emergent evaluation for and treatment of increased intracranial pressure. (See <a href=\"#H27360371\" class=\"local\">'Initial stabilization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnostic approach to the child with muscle weakness is summarized in the algorithms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53075\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef53075 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78154\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef78154 \">algorithm 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51289\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef51289 \">algorithm 3</a>). Assessment should focus on key historical and physical examination findings that help narrow the extensive differential diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81649\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81649 \">table 1</a>).
