Since that time, implants have evolved, although the basic components have remained essentially unchanged. Implants themselves can be filled with either saline or silicone gel. </p><p>Breast implants are used either for reconstructive or aesthetic (cosmetic) purposes.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Implants can help restore the breast to normal appearance following a unilateral or bilateral mastectomy for patients with breast cancer, or following risk reduction surgery. Reconstruction can be performed immediately after the mastectomy or delayed. Implants may also be used for reconstruction of congenital or traumatic defects and for management of significant asymmetries.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aesthetic uses for implants improve an otherwise normal breast and include breast augmentation, and, less commonly, implants can be used together with a mastopexy. </p><p/><p>The prosthetic devices available for reconstruction, choice of procedure, timing, and surgical techniques of implant-based reconstruction will be reviewed here. The use of tissue flaps and grafts for reconstruction is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-breast-reconstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of breast reconstruction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Options for flap-based breast reconstruction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H703147829\"><span class=\"h1\">BREAST PROSTHESES AND OTHER DEVICES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breast implants are composed of an outer silicone shell that is either filled with silicone gel at the time of manufacture or filled with saline by the surgeon at the time of implant placement. Implant-based breast reconstruction has resumed a major role in breast reconstruction with the improvement and reapproval of silicone gel implants and the use of acellular dermal matrix (ADM) to assist with coverage and positioning. Few studies have compared different types of implants. A systematic review included five trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>], each comparing different features of implants, and concluded that the studies were of low quality and of a high risk for bias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. As such, following a candid discussion with the patients regarding the potential issues involved with each type of implant, the surgeon should use the implants with which he or she has obtained good results.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3465980046\"><span class=\"h2\">Types of implants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Implants and tissue expanders are available in an array of different widths, heights, and projections. Saline-filled and silicone gel-filled breast implants with a silicone shell are predominantly used in the United States; however, other types of implants (eg, polyurethane shell, double-lumen implants) are also available and have been used in the United States and elsewhere. </p><p>Other features of breast implants include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Number of compartments </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Single-lumen implants. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Silicone gel implants have an outer silicone shell but are prefilled at the time of manufacture. The composition of the outer silicone shell and the silicone gel material have been modified over time to improve implant performance. Further subtypes for these implants are based upon the qualities of the gel. A later-generation device has a &quot;form-stable&quot; gel that may provide a more favorable shape and appearance to the breast. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Saline implants also have an outer silicone shell and are filled with saline by the surgeon at the time of implant placement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Double-lumen implants have two separate compartments; one is prefilled with silicone gel and the other is filled with saline. In some models, the saline volume can be adjusted by the surgeon. Both combinations of filler material in each lumen are produced with either silicone in the outer lumen with saline in the inner lumen or saline in the outer lumen with silicone in the inner lumen. The complications associated with these implants are similar to those seen with both saline and silicone implants. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shape </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Round with a symmetric disk-like shape</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nonsymmetric implants (also called &quot;teardrop&quot; or &quot;anatomic&quot;) with more projection at the inferior pole</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Each of the shape types may be available in different implant diameters, projections, volumes, and implant-height-to-implant-projection ratio (eg, high profile, moderate profile)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shell surface</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Smooth silicone shell</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Textured silicone shell</p><p/><p>Implants that have been removed from use include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polyurethane implants &ndash; These silicone gel-filled implants were coated with a polyurethane shell that resulted in significantly lower capsular contracture rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, concerns were raised about possible toxicity of the degradation of polyurethane toluene, and these implants were removed from the United States market in the early 1990s; however, they remain widely available worldwide. Surgeons should be aware that removal of these implants can be challenging due to the lack of a defined surgical plane between the implant and surrounding tissue. This may result in more intraoperative bleeding, excess breast tissue removal, and difficult postexplantation reconstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trilucent implants &ndash; These were filled with a radiolucent medical-grade triglyceride filler (eg, soybean oil) that was claimed to be biodegradable with easily excreted byproducts. These implants were associated with high complication rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. They were removed from the market in 1999 due to leaking of the filler, shell deterioration with a loss of texture, extreme fragility of the implant with frequent ruptures, and a pronounced inflammatory reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MISTI gold polyvinylpyrrolidone-hydrogel filled implants &ndash; These were used in the 1990s as an alternative to silicone-filled implants with claims of improved radiolucency and gel biocompatibility. Unfortunately, subsequent reports showed that the implants increased in volume over time (an average of 43 percent) and had high rates of capsular contracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1603528219\"><span class=\"h2\">Tissue expanders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first stage of implant-based breast reconstruction often includes placement of the tissue expander. Procedural statistics from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons from 2015 demonstrate that nearly 90 percent of prosthetic breast reconstruction is performed in two stages, using a tissue expander first [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A tissue expander is a silicone shell that is incrementally filled with saline through a port that is either integrated or remotely located. Once the appropriate breast shape has been reached, the expander is removed and replaced with an implant. </p><p>Many expander options are available, such as<strong> </strong>expanders that are crescent-shaped, only expanding as a lower pole of the new breast, as well as differential expanders stretching the lower pole more than the remaining breast shape. Many tissue expanders have suture tabs located along the peripheral base of the device to accurately place and stabilize its position on the chest wall. The majority of tissue expanders that are currently available on the market are filled incrementally with saline; however, a new tissue expander has received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance that is incrementally and automatically filled with carbon dioxide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>One to three weeks after the saline-based tissue expander is placed, in-office expansion begins. For expanders with integrated ports, a magnetic finder (compass) is used to locate the proper injection site under the skin. A needle is then inserted into the skin through the port, and sterile saline is infused into the expander. This procedure is repeated every one to two weeks until the desired volume of expansion has been achieved. Tissue expander filling should be stopped during the phase of radiotherapy delivery. In some situations, temporary deflation of the expander may be requested to allow for adequate delivery to the chest wall and internal mammary lymph nodes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-breast-reconstruction#H2464163\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of breast reconstruction&quot;, section on 'Radiation therapy and timing of breast reconstruction'</a>.)</p><p>Following the final expansion, usually one to two months, the patient is returned to the operating room for the second stage of the reconstruction. The expander is removed, and a permanent implant is placed. Additional revisions are performed at this time as well as nipple reconstruction, fat grafting, and repositioning of the implant. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-breast-reconstruction#H44798710\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of breast reconstruction&quot;, section on 'Other procedures'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2285219663\"><span class=\"h2\">Acellular dermal matrix</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of acellular dermal matrices (ADMs) from allograft (human cadaveric) or xenograft (nonhuman) sources has broadened the options for prosthetic reconstruction following mastectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. The ADM is supplied as a sheet of decellularized material consisting primarily of collagen and elastin. ADM is meant to serve as biologic scaffolding for fibroblast and angioblast ingrowth and, over time, is replaced by host connective tissue at varying rates. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reconstructive-materials-used-in-surgery-classification-and-host-response\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reconstructive materials used in surgery: Classification and host response&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The principle use of ADM in breast reconstruction is to provide adequate tissue support to the mastectomy skin flaps. In cases where the tissue expander or implant is positioned partially under the pectoralis major muscle, the purpose of the ADM is to stabilize the position of the pectoralis major muscle to prevent upward migration of the muscle, also known as &quot;window shading.&quot; In cases where the tissue expander or implant is positioned above the pectoralis major muscle (ie, prepectoral reconstruction), the ADM is used to line the inner aspect of the entire mastectomy skin flap to provide additional soft tissue support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. ADM can be used for both one- and two-stage prosthetic reconstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. It is important to remember that ADMs carry a general approval in the United States for &quot;homologous use&quot; for soft tissue support; however, a specific breast reconstruction indication remains outstanding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1616409128\"><span class=\"h1\">CONCERNS OVER BREAST IMPLANTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In response to the concerns and controversy surrounding silicone gel breast implants, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Institute of Medicine (IOM) reviewed the available information and literature on breast implants and concluded that there is no credible scientific evidence to suggest that there are any long-term health implications for women, other than surgical or implant-related local complications that may or may not result in reoperation. However, it remains a possibility that certain women, particularly those with preexisting allergies, may be predisposed to immune-mediated reactions to medical device materials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84894218\"><span class=\"h2\">Silicone implants and connective tissue disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 1992, the FDA issued a moratorium on the use of silicone gel breast implants in response to a public concern regarding their safety and a lack of studies to refute these concerns. There were anecdotal reports that raised the questions of a possible association between silicone implants and various diseases (specifically connective tissue diseases) or a &quot;silicone adjuvant syndrome.&quot; However, large-scale epidemiologic studies and literature reviews failed to show increased rates of seroprevalences of antinuclear antibodies or other autoantibodies, or increased risks of connective tissue diseases in women with breast implants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/20-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-28</a>]. One study found no difference in self-reported diseases or symptoms, or in the presence of autoantibodies, between women with intact silicone gel implants and women with ruptured implants, including extracapsular rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The only exception was capsular contracture, which was reported six times more frequently by women with extracapsular ruptures compared with women who had intact implants. </p><p>A systematic review of the relationship of silicone breast implants to other cancers (not breast) concluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epidemiologic studies provide no support for an increased risk of either sarcoma or multiple myeloma among breast implant recipients, disputing clinical and laboratory findings suggesting such a link. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although a number of epidemiologic studies have demonstrated elevated risks of cervical, vulvar, and lung cancers among breast implant patients, it is likely that these relate more to lifestyle characteristics (eg, cigarette smoking, sexual behavior) than to the effects of the implants. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brain cancer risk, suggested in one study, has not been confirmed in either an update of the mortality experience in this study or on the basis of any other investigations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At present, there is no convincing evidence that breast implants alter the risk of these specific nonbreast malignancies. However, the FDA issued warnings in 2011, 2016, and 2017 about an association between textured breast implants and the development of anaplastic large cell lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p>Based upon this information, the American College of Rheumatology concluded in 1995 that silicone implants expose patients to <strong>no</strong> demonstrable additional risk for connective tissue or rheumatologic disease. After extensive review of the data and a report from the IOM, the FDA also concluded that there was no convincing evidence linking silicone implants with connective tissue disease. Restrictions on their use were lifted in 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Three manufacturers of silicone gel breast implants have demonstrated the relative safety of the silicone gel implants based on three categories that include reoperation, capsular contracture, and rupture as well as four specific cohorts of patients that include primary augmentation, revision augmentation, primary reconstruction, and revision reconstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. Minimum follow-up for all patients in these studies ranged from six to 10 years. Outcomes included a rupture rate ranging from 5 to 17 percent, capsular contracture rate ranging from 2 to 28 percent, and reoperation rate ranging from 18 to 71 percent. </p><p>It should be noted that these adverse events are time dependent. The FDA has recommended that all women with silicone implants undergo regular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) screening throughout their lifetimes to assess for leakage (silent rupture), starting three years after the first implant surgery and every two years thereafter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. However, there is little evidence to support a recommendation for regular MRI screening, which is expensive and may lead to anxiety and false positive results, resulting in unnecessary surgery. Therefore, most experts agree that breast MRI could be used as a confirmatory diagnostic test and not be used to screen asymptomatic women for implant rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].

A systematic review of breast-implant-associated ALCL concluded that this form of ALCL clinically behaves more like the less aggressive primary cutaneous form of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-negative ALCL rather than the more aggressive systemic form but that further research is needed to better understand its nature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In 2016, breast implant-associated ALCL was provisionally recognized by the World Health Organization and standardized diagnosis and treatment guidelines established by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery#H24299623\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of reconstructive and aesthetic breast surgery&quot;, section on 'Anaplastic large cell lymphoma'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H175315701\"><span class=\"h1\">PROCEDURE SELECTION AND INFORMED CONSENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients should be offered choices for reconstruction that fit their lifestyle, that are congruent with the available local tissue, and that help to match the opposite breast. Although there is some evidence in the existing literature that favors autogenous tissue reconstruction over implant reconstruction based on long-term (greater than five-year) outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/42-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-48</a>], implant-based reconstruction will always have a role in breast reconstruction. It would be unwise to offer an autologous reconstruction solely to avoid the use of an implant since it is not an absolute that autologous tissue reconstruction will never require an implant. Fat necrosis or weight changes may result in a smaller-than-desired breast mound, and an implant may be required to achieve goals or symmetry. Moreover, the use of some autologous tissues (eg, latissimus myocutaneous flap) usually requires an implant for completion. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The advantages of implant-based reconstruction are surgical simplicity, the use of cosmetically similar adjacent tissue to cover the implant, the lack of donor site morbidity, reduced operative time, and more rapid postoperative recovery compared with purely autologous reconstructions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. For older patients, those with significant medical comorbidities, and women with minimal tissue at the various potential donor sites (abdomen, buttock, back, and thigh), <span class=\"nowrap\">expander/implant-based</span> techniques may be the preferred option. The best candidates have minimal ptosis (breast sag), a moderate breast volume (500 g or less), and adequate soft tissue for coverage. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The disadvantages of implant-based reconstruction include more difficulty obtaining symmetry to the normal opposite breast, a larger number of stages to achieve completion, difficulty when the breast has been irradiated, and implant visibility and palpability concerns in thin patients and in patients with thin mastectomy skin flaps. Tissue expansion requires frequent clinic visits for expansion (usually every one to two weeks for one to two months) and a second surgery to place the reconstructive implant. The use of acellular dermal matrices (ADMs) can improve results in the very thin patient or a patient with contour irregularities postmastectomy. For women who require postmastectomy chest wall radiation therapy, tissue expansion can be a difficult and complication-prone endeavor. In these cases, autogenous tissue (flap) reconstruction is generally preferred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. While many surgeons can reconstruct an irradiated chest with implant expander reconstruction, others will reject tissue expansion and implant reconstruction in this group, relying more on vascularized autologous tissue. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-breast-reconstruction#H2464163\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of breast reconstruction&quot;, section on 'Radiation therapy and timing of breast reconstruction'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Goals should include not only size (presumably matching the opposite breast, whether reconstructed or otherwise) but also shape issues such as cleavage and projection (eg, high profile with a more rounded appearance, moderate profiles with adequate projection but possibly increased width). The implant reconstruction is chosen by assessing skin coverage, thickness, and suitability for expansion. Further evaluation assesses pectoralis muscle quality and determines the need for ADM graft. Size and shape goals then dictate the number of stages and course, often consisting of one or two outpatient procedures. The variety of available implants, both silicone and saline, with the adjunctive use of ADM to facilitate coverage and shape, can fulfill almost every patient desire and goal. </p><p>The informed consent for breast augmentation and reconstruction should include the nature of the surgery, indications, benefits, consequences, and potential complications of the procedure. In addition, the consent should include alternatives to the procedure and the benefits, risks, and consequences of the stated alternatives. It is now recommended that all women receiving breast implants be informed about the risks associated with implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2864235022\"><span class=\"h2\">Procedure staging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Implant-based reconstruction originally entailed placement of a silicone-filled prosthesis beneath the remaining mastectomy skin flaps or, in some cases, the pectoralis major muscle. This approach is sometimes termed primary implant reconstruction and also referred to as direct-to-implant (DTI) reconstruction. In most cases, placement of a permanent implant is preceded by tissue expansion (&quot;secondary&quot; or two-stage <span class=\"nowrap\">implant/expander</span> reconstruction), which stretches the existing soft tissue, mainly skin, to cover the new breast (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F77306\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77306 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p>In the past, without providing additional soft tissue coverage to replace the skin removed by the mastectomy, the breast shape following DTI reconstruction was often distorted and lacked adequate projection. With the advent of tissue expansion, DTI reconstruction is less commonly used, but DTI has been increasing in popularity with improvement in reconstructive techniques and with patients desiring fewer operative procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/18,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,53</a>]. When DTI is chosen, it is usually performed as an immediate procedure, provided the mastectomy flaps are well perfused. DTI reconstruction is typically reserved for women who have ample skin following the mastectomy. Women with small, nonptotic breasts can generally be reconstructed in a single stage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F80679\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80679 \">picture 1</a>). DTI reconstruction may also be possible in patients who have been previously augmented, because the skin and soft tissues are pre-expanded, and the contralateral augmented breast is usually already well matched with an implant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F80679\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80679 \">picture 1</a>). Skin-sparing and nipple-areolar-sparing mastectomy may allow consideration of the one-stage DTI option, although revisions are sometimes necessary. Another consideration is the possible need for radiation treatments and chemotherapy. Many radiation oncologists will not accept the presence of an implant during radiation treatments. Further complicating a choice for DTI reconstruction is frequent insurance coverage interference with any subsequent revision or adjustment. By approving a &quot;one-stage&quot; reconstruction, coverage for revisions might be precluded. Most plastic surgeons in the United States prefer the two-stage technique because the second stage provides an opportunity to optimally shape and configure the reconstructed breast by adjusting the implant pocket, selecting an appropriate permanent implant, and releasing periprosthetic scar tissue. Regardless of the technique selected, there should be a thorough and complete discussion with the patient and her insurance company to allow all potential options that may be needed. </p><p>For these reasons, DTI reconstruction still remains relatively less frequent compared with a two-stage technique. Whenever there is a skin deficiency or there is questionable viability of the skin, tissue expanders or delayed reconstruction should be considered. A two-stage implant reconstruction also affords the opportunity to revise the reconstruction as needed. Women with large ptotic breasts may require more skin excision during the mastectomy and therefore need more expansion. Such women may also require a contralateral breast procedure in order to achieve acceptable symmetry. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H623354846\"><span class=\"h2\">Counseling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breast implants should not be placed in women with active infection anywhere in their body, women with breast cancer who have not received treatment, or women who are currently breastfeeding. The safety and efficacy of breast implants has not been established in women with autoimmune disorders, compromised immune function, and in those with risk factors for impaired wound healing. Women with a history of depression or mental health issues should hold off until stabilization or resolution of psychological symptoms prior to considering placement of breast implants. </p><p>Breast implants can be considered in young women, albeit with age restrictions. Silicone gel implants can be offered to women who are at least 22 years of age.

The authors concluded that while implants may impair mammography, they appear to facilitate detection of palpable breast cancers on physical examination. However, based on this same patient population, augmented patients treated with breast-conserving therapy often experienced poor cosmetic results and frequently required reoperation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1045486311\"><span class=\"h2\">Informed consent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with any type of reconstruction, the patient needs to be carefully selected and counseled prior to undertaking reconstruction with <span class=\"nowrap\">expander/implant-based</span> techniques. Patient counseling should include a discussion of all options for implant-based reconstruction, potential complications, the need for multiple surgeries and revisions, and a realistic discussion about patient expectations. Even when reconstruction is completed, future revisions or implant replacement may be needed for laxity, stretch, and aging.</p><p>Implant-based breast reconstruction should be discussed with all patients seeking breast reconstruction. Patients with medical issues or who refuse larger, more complicated surgeries should be presented with the pros and cons of implant-based breast reconstruction. The wide variety of choices of implant alone, tissue expander followed by implant, and implant plus myocutaneous flap (with or without the use of ADM tissue) gives the surgeon and patient many options to choose from. </p><p>Implant-based breast reconstruction poses a greater challenge compared with aesthetic breast augmentation. In addition to attempting a symmetric result, the mastectomy adds to the difficulty of producing a supple projection with its inherent scarring and possible restriction. Furthermore, the emotional cost of a cancer diagnosis interferes with both expectations as well as final acceptance. Immediate attempts at reconstruction add further demands toward producing a &quot;normal breast&quot; in one or two operations. The surgeon must discuss all of these issues with the patient or be faced with an unrealistic patient expectation and, possibly, dissatisfaction with an otherwise acceptable result. The patient must understand the difficulties that can occur with breast reconstruction postmastectomy.</p><p>Complications can lead to delayed healing, and problems may result in implant removal, infection, or excessive scarring. Capsular contracture can occur and may be related to circulating bacteria in the future. Implants are not designed to last forever, and many will need to be replaced at some point in the future. The need for revision to achieve symmetry must also be understood. In addition, the position of the implant can affect the glandular volume, as with subglandular positioning, or reduce volume of the pectoralis major muscle, as with submuscular positioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Implant rupture, which may be detected by clinical examination as well as radiologic studies, should result in implant replacement. Other reasons to replace an implant are capsular contracture, ptosis, or inappropriate size and shape. Lastly, the patient's needs may change, or an improved implant may become available. If these would improve results, replacement should be made available. </p><p>Some patients remember the past controversy concerning silicone implants, and a full discussion as to any new and conclusive data should be undertaken. (See <a href=\"#H1616409128\" class=\"local\">'Concerns over breast implants'</a> above.)</p><p>In addition, the US Food and Drug Administration recommends that women receiving breast implants for reconstruction and augmentation should be informed about the small risk of breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma during the preoperative counseling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma#H3991722249\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Informed consent prior to implant placement'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3642283656\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE PREPARATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H780692505\"><span class=\"h2\">Preoperative markings and implant selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Implant selection is based upon dimensional planning and should involve the patient's input. In addition, the mastectomy specimen can be used for planning, and, ideally, preoperative and premastectomy evaluation can help with implant size and shape choices. Skin laxity and desired shape ultimately combine to produce the potential implant, height, width, and projection. Markings and measurements should consider the addition of an acellular dermal matrix (ADM) flap thickness. The opposite breast is also considered as well as the presence of preoperative asymmetry; the patient should be made aware of such asymmetry and measurements. Other considerations of implant choice involve tissue coverage and thickness. A round textured silicone implant may be appropriate when full and adequate coverage is present, whereas in a thin patient, and often following mastectomy where implant coverage is not thick, a round smooth silicone implant would be a better choice. If the patient's anatomy dictates a different desired measurement and height and width, form-stable implants should be considered. Women considering textured surface breast implants should be informed about the risk of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). Once the base width, height, and projection of the desired implant are determined, an implant can be selected from available manufacturers to produce the desired result. It is suggested that a number of implants are ordered and made available at the time of the surgery, both slightly larger and smaller than the dimensional planning size.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H218867935\"><span class=\"h2\">Prophylactic antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although systemic antibiotics, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefazolin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefazolin</a>, are widely used for prophylaxis at the time of implantation, there is little high-quality evidence to support their efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Guidelines from multidisciplinary expert groups in the United States also recognize the low risk of surgical site infection with breast reconstruction or augmentation surgery and do not recommend routine antimicrobial prophylaxis, except for patients who have particular risk factors for infection, such as patients with diabetes mellitus, obesity, known colonization with microorganisms, and immunocompromise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>]. In a systematic review of surgical site infections following aesthetic breast surgery, the estimated mean incidence of postoperative surgical site infection following augmentation surgery was 1.4 percent (range 0 to 1.7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. No reduction in infection rates was observed with preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis usage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-prevention-of-surgical-site-infection-in-adults#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimicrobial prophylaxis for prevention of surgical site infection in adults&quot;, section on 'Breast surgery'</a>.)</p><p>If prophylaxis is given, it should cover the most common organisms responsible for wound infection, particularly staphylococci. A first-generation cephalosporin (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefazolin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefazolin</a> 1 to 2 g intravenously) is effective for most clean procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. A single dose should be given within 60 minutes prior to the surgical incision. The available data suggest that extended prophylaxis following implant-based breast reconstruction is also unnecessary. In a randomized trial comparing two-stage breast reconstruction with and without postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis, rates of surgical site infection were equivalent for 24 hours of antibiotics compared with extended oral antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-implant-infections#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast implant infections&quot;, section on 'Microbiology and epidemiology of infection'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-prevention-of-surgical-site-infection-in-adults#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimicrobial prophylaxis for prevention of surgical site infection in adults&quot;, section on 'Antibiotic selection'</a>.)</p><p>The use of topical antimicrobials and antiseptics for irrigation of the surgical pocket at the time of implantation has been suggested, but there are limited data to support this practice. Retrospective studies and prospective cohort studies have reported lower rates of surgical site infection and capsular contracture following irrigation of the implant pocket with a combination of antibiotics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefuroxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefuroxime</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefazolin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefazolin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a>) and antiseptics (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=povidone-iodine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">povidone iodine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacitracin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bacitracin</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>]. Although not proven in controlled clinical trials, pocket irrigation with an antibiotic solution or povidone iodine is commonly performed by most plastic surgeons. (See <a href=\"#H3339797635\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic irrigation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2101057771\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL TECHNIQUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Implant-based breast reconstruction or augmentation can be accomplished in a single stage or in multiple stages, the first stage of which involves the placement of the tissue expander. The most common technique used for <span class=\"nowrap\">expander/implant</span> placement consists of initially positioning the device in a pocket deep to the pectoralis major muscle and overlying breast skin. In properly selected patients, a tissue expander may be placed in a prepectoral position, which avoids the morbidity of muscle elevation and muscular distortion of the implant in the final reconstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The benefits of this approach are that patients usually have less pain due to the avoidance of pectoral muscle disruption; there is no-to-minimal breast animation deformity with pectoral muscle contraction, and a natural breast contour can be maintained. </p><p>A more natural result may be achieved using a dual plane technique, with superior and middle muscle coverage and the use of acellular dermal matrix (ADM) for coverage inferiorly, to allow a more relaxed breast shape. </p><p>For traditional tissue expander reconstruction based totally or partially beneath the pectoralis major muscle, the serratus anterior muscle or fascia may be used to provide additional coverage for the expander. The technique of complete muscle coverage is to develop a subpectoral pocket superiorly and continue laterally with serratus muscle as needed to obtain complete coverage. Overall, the pocket size should match the size of the expander. It is important to not alter or undermine the inframammary fold or to undermine to the contralateral breast, as these lower and medial borders are critical landmarks for aesthetic appearance of the breast. If there is concern that the mastectomy flaps have compromised vascular supply, expander placement should be delayed. It can be difficult to achieve a natural breast shape with complete submuscular coverage even after full tissue expansion. Further difficulty occurs if the mastectomy surgery has resulted in damage to the lower pectoralis muscle. </p><p>If the pectoralis muscle has been damaged during the mastectomy or from prior surgery, having biologic tissue available to provide coverage over an implant is important. ADM has assumed a major role in providing this coverage. A more desirable result may be obtained by creating dual plane coverage with the use of muscle above and ADM below, thereby totally controlling the pocket, width and shape, and coverage of the implant. However, the high cost and insurance coverage of ADM can be challenging. The technique uses the normal muscle in the upper portion of the chest for suturing the ADM to the muscle to create a pocket both medially and laterally. An expander or implant can then be placed beneath this combined muscle ADM cover, either with or without the need for expansion. It is common to need prolonged drainage with the use of ADM; seroma formation is common. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2615538964\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing and technique of exchange procedure including permanent implant selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The specific expansion technique used depends on expander type and port location. The integrated port can be located with a magnet; it should be located at the initial surgery and its position confirmed before each expansion. The skin overlying the port is sterilized with a prep solution, and the implant is filled using a small gauge needle (22 to 23 gauge) until the desired volume is reached but before patient discomfort and excessive tightness. </p><p>The timing and scheduling of exchanging a tissue expander with the appropriate implant is tailored to each patient. Patients often desire as quick a process as possible, but appropriate healing and tissue relaxation is required. The time can range from three months to one year, with no standard timing. The time has more to do with the tissue softening, draping, and patient size acceptance. The use of ADM significantly improves timeliness, as the inferior pole of muscle no longer has to be stretched. The use of skin-sparing mastectomies also permits a more supple skin area that, when combined with ADM, achieves full coverage more quickly and with less distortion. When the size and shape of the expanding breast closely match the opposite breast, a few weeks of delay in scheduling the exchange helps to maintain the shape. Too rapid an exchange will often result in a tighter skin envelope than desired.</p><p>The technique of exchange depends on the initial choice of tissue expander. The mastectomy scar is often used for exposure. Using the lateral portion of the scar for exposure may make it easier to achieve good central projection. It may be helpful to perform a partial capsulectomy or capsulotomy release if the capsule around the expander has thickened. Once the pocket is exposed, irrigation with saline and antibiotic solution after expander removal is suggested. Good technique also dictates changing gloves and preparing the site in an attempt to minimize contact with the implant and patient's skin (&quot;no-touch technique&quot;). (See <a href=\"#H3953715160\" class=\"local\">'Preventing capsular contracture'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3339797635\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic irrigation'</a> below.)</p><p>Measuring the fluid volume in the expander also helps with volume and implant choice; the use of an implant sizer can further help with correct implant sizing. The implant is oriented appropriately, drains are placed as necessary, and closure of the incision completes the procedure. Dressings are placed carefully to avoid displacing the implant or producing excessive pressure on the skin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3953715160\"><span class=\"h2\">Preventing capsular contracture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A &quot;no-touch&quot; technique of implant placement reduces capsular contracture, possibly by eliminating any possible contact of the implant with skin or breast bacteria. With this technique, one study of 2863 patients with saline implants followed over 17 years cited a contracture rate of 0.6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. A cone-shaped disposable device (Keller funnel) has also been developed to facilitate this technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. However, there are no studies demonstrating a lower capsular contracture rate when this product is used. </p><p>A manual pocket dissection technique and the use of drains were associated with capsular contracture in a report of 3002 patients following breast augmentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Manual dissection increased the risk of capsular contracture sevenfold compared with diathermy dissection, while the use of drains increased the risk more than fourfold. Incision placement and implant pocket location may also play a role in the development of capsular contracture. Implants in the submuscular plane (both saline and silicone) have a decreased contracture rate. In one report of breast augmentation, the incidence of contracture was 0.59 percent in the inframammary incision group and 9.5 percent in the periareolar incision group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. This is presumed to be due to greater contamination of the breast pocket, with intraductal bacteria resulting from a periareolar incision. Data from the Danish Registry for Plastic Surgery of the Breast found that 16 percent of 2277 women had capsular contracture at an average follow-up of 1.6 years after implant placement for breast augmentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Submuscular placement of the implant decreased the risk of capsular contracture, whereas surgical routes other than inframammary and drainage of implant cavity were associated with increased risk of capsular contracture. </p><p>Textured implants appear to reduce the incidence of capsular contracture, particularly when using implants in a subglandular position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/73,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,74</a>]. However, patients may prefer a smooth shell when using saline implants because of less palpability. A systematic review identified seven randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. The risk for capsular contracture was significantly reduced for surface texturing (odds ratio 0.19, 95% CI 0.07-0.52). Contrary to these findings, one small prospective study of 20 women with a subglandular Siltex textured implant (pore size 30 to 70 micrometers) on one side and a smooth implant on the other side did not find a difference in capsular contracture at 7.5 years follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. The patients themselves preferred the smooth implants. A similar prospective study by the same investigators was also unable to demonstrate a difference in capsular contracture rates when comparing Biocell textured implant (pore size 300 to 600 micrometers) to smooth implants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p>A study of 17,656 patients receiving 31,985 textured shaped implants reported on risk factors for capsular contracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. At a median follow-up of 3.4 years, the incidence of capsular contracture ranged from 2.3 to 4.1 percent; malposition, 1.5 to 2.7 percent; and late seroma, 0.1 to 0.2 percent, which included four cases of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). Significant risk factors for capsular contracture were subglandular implant placement, periareolar incision site, older device age in the augmentation cohort, older subject age in the revision-augmentation cohort, and higher body mass index and absence of povidone-iodine pocket irrigation in the reconstruction cohort.</p><p>A systematic review concluded that there are not any reliable and reproducible data to make any firm conclusions regarding type of implant (saline verus silicone), smooth versus textured, or position (subglandular, submuscular, and subfascial) for preventing capsular contracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. The data loosely support the following conclusions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autologous tissue combined with an implant for breast reconstruction may decrease capsular contracture rates. The use of a latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap together with an implant for breast reconstruction had a contracture rate of only 3.6 percent at a mean follow-up of almost two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delayed breast reconstruction with tissue expanders and then implants was found to have lower capsular contraction rates compared with immediate reconstruction in a series of 142 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. This may be due to a lower chance of bacterial contamination at the time of delayed reconstruction compared with immediate reconstruction.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3339797635\"><span class=\"h3\">Antibiotic irrigation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibiotic pocket irrigation has been used to decrease the risk of bacterial contamination, which may cause capsular contracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/82,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">82,83</a>]. Intraoperative povidone-iodine (Betadine) irrigation of the breast pocket has been used for this purpose. However, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and manufacturers have recommended against contact of breast implants with povidone-iodine due to concern over altering the integrity of the implant shell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/84-87\" class=\"abstract_t\">84-87</a>]. Before the FDA decree on Betadine in 2000, irrigation solution consisted of 50 mL of povidone-iodine, 1 g of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefazolin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefazolin</a>, 80 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a>, and 500 mL of normal saline. After 2000, the solution consisted of 50,000 units of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacitracin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bacitracin</a>, 1 g of cefazolin, 80 mg of gentamicin, and 500 mL of normal saline. </p><p>However, in spite of these warnings, one review of 1244 saline breast implants positioned in a submuscular location for breast augmentation found a decreased incidence of capsular contracture when dilute Betadine was used as the irrigation solution along with coverage of the nipple-areola complex and incision with Betadine-soaked gauze (compared with data obtained from the FDA and Institute of Medicine) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. There was no increase in the incidence of saline implant deflation. A study of 436 patients that compared cephalothin (Keflin) implant pocket irrigation fluid in the lumen of the double-lumen implants, with no cephalothin, found no significant difference in development of capsular contraction between the two groups (8.1 percent versus 5.9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. However, a study of 335 patients that used a triple antibiotic solution found a 1.8 percent rate of capsular contracture for patients undergoing primary breast augmentation and a 9.5 percent rate in breast reconstruction patients at a mean follow-up of 14 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. These rates were significantly lower than in other published series. One limitation of this report is that the antibiotic irrigation regimen was changed during the study period. </p><p>Oral antibiotics were examined in a single non-peer-reviewed retrospective study of 249 breast augmentation patients. There was no difference in capsular contracture rates when three days of oral antibiotics (mostly cephalosporins) were administered compared with no antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. Future prevention techniques may focus on prevention and eradication of implant bacterial biofilms (particularly<em> Staphylococcus epidermidis</em>), which have been found to have a strong link to capsular contracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2003074947\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS AND REOPERATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications associated with implant-based breast reconstruction that may or may not lead to reoperation can be classified as complications inherent to surgery and common to all, including seroma, bleeding and hematoma, skin necrosis, and infection, among others, and those specifically related to the reconstruction, such as skin necrosis, implant capsular contracture, implant exposure or malposition, and suboptimal aesthetic appearance. These, and the rare complication breast-implant associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of reconstructive and aesthetic breast surgery&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2919352082\"><span class=\"h2\">Reoperation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reoperation on the breast is the most commonly reported complication associated with breast implants for most implant types and indications. Based on manufacturer data, the most frequent indication for reoperation after breast implant placement is capsular contracture, followed by the combination of breast asymmetry and implant malposition. </p><p>Reoperation occurs in up to one-third of breast augmentation patients and one-half of breast reconstruction patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/84-87\" class=\"abstract_t\">84-87</a>]. In one Canadian study, 88 percent of 3972 women underwent at least one reoperation during an average follow-up of 5.1 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. The reasons for such high reoperation rates are multifactorial and also depend on implant type. Reported rates must be considered in context. A complication may result in a reoperation, but a reoperation is not necessarily related to a complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. As an example, patient desire for a larger or smaller implant size contributes to reported reoperation rates. In a review of a 15-year experience with 812 patients with breast implants, a significantly increased overall reoperation rate was seen for silicone compared with saline implants, but there was no difference in implant-specific reoperation rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. The investigators concluded that the use of overall reoperation rates as an indication of complications of breast implants can lead to both an overestimation of implant-related complications and to inaccurate conclusions.</p><p>Implementing measures to decrease capsular contracture and prevent implant malposition or asymmetry (the two common causes for reoperation) and specific patient evaluation protocols may reduce the likelihood of reoperation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. In one series of 50 consecutive silicone gel implant breast augmentation patients, the reoperation rate was 0 percent with 47 patients followed up with at three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].

Implants may also be used for reconstruction of congenital or traumatic defects, for management of significant breast asymmetries, or to improve the aesthetic appearance of an otherwise normal breast. (See <a href=\"#H1826542479\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breast implants are composed of an outer silicone shell that is either filled with silicone gel at the time of manufacture or filled with saline by the surgeon at the time of implant placement. Breast implants are available in an array of widths, heights, and projections and may have a smooth or textured surface. (See <a href=\"#H703147829\" class=\"local\">'Breast prostheses and other devices'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the prevailing literature favors autogenous tissue breast reconstruction, implant-based reconstruction will always have a role in breast reconstruction. Compared with purely autologous breast reconstruction, advantages of implant-based reconstruction are surgical simplicity, the use of cosmetically similar adjacent tissue for coverage of the implant, the lack of donor site morbidity, reduced operative time, and a more rapid postoperative recovery. However, the possible need for radiation treatments need to be considered; many radiation oncologists will not accept the presence of an implant during radiation treatments, and implant-based reconstruction following radiation therapy is prone to complications. (See <a href=\"#H175315701\" class=\"local\">'Procedure selection and informed consent'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-breast-reconstruction#H697193552\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of breast reconstruction&quot;, section on 'Impact of radiation therapy on implants'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery#H2209525262\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of reconstructive and aesthetic breast surgery&quot;, section on 'Radiation therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Implant-based breast reconstruction or augmentation can be accomplished in a single stage (direct-to-implant reconstruction [DTI]) or in multiple stages, the first stage of which involves the placement of the tissue expander. A tissue expander is a silicone shell that is incrementally filled with saline through a port that is either integrated or remotely located. Once the appropriate breast shape has been reached, the expander is removed and replaced with an implant. Whenever there is a skin deficiency or there is questionable viability of the skin, two-stage reconstruction using a tissue expander or delayed reconstruction should be considered. DTI reconstruction is typically reserved for women who have ample skin following the mastectomy; women with small, nonptotic breasts can generally be reconstructed in a single stage. (See <a href=\"#H1603528219\" class=\"local\">'Tissue expanders'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2864235022\" class=\"local\">'Procedure staging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common technique used for <span class=\"nowrap\">expander/implant</span> placement consists of positioning the device in a pocket deep to the pectoralis major muscle and overlying breast skin (ie, complete muscle coverage). A more natural result may be achieved using a dual plane technique, with superior and middle muscle coverage and the use of acellular dermal matrix (ADM) for coverage inferiorly to allow a more relaxed breast shape. Measures to prevent capsular contracture may include using diathermy for pocket dissection rather than manual dissection, using a &quot;no-touch&quot; technique of implant placement, and pocket irrigation with an antibiotic solution prior to implant placement; however, there are no reliable and reproducible data to support any of these observations. (See <a href=\"#H2101057771\" class=\"local\">'Surgical techniques'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2285219663\" class=\"local\">'Acellular dermal matrix'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications associated with implant-based breast reconstruction that may or may not lead to reoperation can be classified as complications inherent to surgery in general (eg, seroma, bleeding and hematoma, skin necrosis, and infection) and those specifically related to the implant-based breast reconstruction (eg, skin necrosis, implant capsular contracture, implant exposure or malposition, suboptimal aesthetic appearance). There is no credible evidence to suggest that there are any long-term health implications for women with breast implants, other than known surgical or implant-related local complications that may or may not result in reoperation. Women with textured surface breast implants have a very small but increased risk of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). Because implant-associated ALCL is extremely rare, it is not possible to identify any risk factors other than textured implant use (eg, type of implant [silicone versus saline] or implant indications [reconstruction versus aesthetic augmentation]).
