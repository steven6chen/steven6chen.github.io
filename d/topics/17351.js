According to two reviews of orthopedic management in the primary care setting , broken toes account for approximately 9 percent of fractures treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toe-fractures-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Of these, over 60 to 75 percent involve the smaller toes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toe-fractures-in-adults/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Although often dismissed as inconsequential, toe fractures that are improperly managed can lead to significant pain and disability. Treatment is generally straightforward, with excellent outcomes.</p><p>This topic will review the evaluation and management of toe fractures in adults. Toe fractures in children and other foot injuries are discussed separately.

The second through fifth toes typically have three phalanges, while the great toe has two. Lesser toes, especially the fifth, may occasionally have only two phalanges (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78924%7EEM%2F61079%7EEM%2F71857\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78924 graphicRef61079 graphicRef71857 \">figure 1A-C</a>).</p><p>Tendons and ligaments insert at the bases of each phalanx (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F102228\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef102228 \">figure 2</a>). The forces exerted by these structures may contribute to displacement of fracture fragments. Tendons, joint capsule, or other soft tissues may sometimes become interposed between fracture fragments, rendering them irreducible except by an open surgical approach.</p><p>The plantar digital artery and nerve pass together along each side of each toe deep to the plantar surface (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93192\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef93192 \">figure 3</a>). Each toe also has a pair of dorsal digital arteries and nerves (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F102228\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef102228 \">figure 2</a>). The dorsal neurovascular structures are generally smaller and less significant than the ones on the plantar surface, but there is some variation among individuals, particularly with the first (great) toe. It is unusual for the neurovascular bundle to be injured as a consequence of a toe fracture, unless the fracture is open (eg, lawnmower injuries) or caused by a serious crush injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common causes of toe fractures are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Axial loading (eg, stubbing a toe)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abduction injury, classically involving the fifth digit with a &quot;night-walker&quot; fracture</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Crush injury from a falling object</p><p/><p>Less commonly, joint hyperextension or hyperflexion can lead to spiral or avulsion fractures. Crush injuries are more likely to involve soft tissue and neurovascular damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toe-fractures-in-adults/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients usually present for evaluation because of pain, difficulty walking, or inability to fit comfortably into a shoe. In patients with sensory neuropathy (eg, due to diabetes), presentation may be delayed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the diabetic foot&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Ecchymosis and swelling are usually present and develop within the first few hours after injury. Palpation along the digit frequently reveals point tenderness at the fracture site. However, the toe is often diffusely swollen and tender, making it difficult to pinpoint the fracture location by examination alone.</p><p>With displaced fractures and dislocations, deformity of the toe is usually apparent. Rotational deformity is assessed by examining the orientation of the nail bed of the fractured toe. Rotational deformity is present if the nail bed does not lie in the same plane as that of the corresponding toe on the opposite foot [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toe-fractures-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>In all cases, capillary refill should be assessed and the skin of the digit carefully inspected looking for lacerations and devitalized skin. Any wound should be carefully examined to rule out communication with the fracture site (ie, an open fracture). Devitalized skin may slough and convert a closed fracture into an open one. Injury to surrounding soft tissue including the nail and nail bed can occur, particularly with crush injuries. Subungual hematoma is often a marker of an underlying distal phalanx fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toe-fractures-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Paronychia following minor trauma suggests fracture of the underlying phalanx; radiographs should be obtained in such circumstances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toe-fractures-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subungual-hematoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subungual hematoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paronychia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paronychia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Suspected phalangeal fractures and dislocations should be evaluated with plain radiographs, including anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique views (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F70754%7EEM%2F82505%7EEM%2F61555\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70754 graphicRef82505 graphicRef61555 \">image 1A-C</a>). The lateral view is often difficult to read due to overlying structures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82505\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef82505 \">image 1B</a>). Non-displaced or minimally displaced fractures of the toes are common (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F50007\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50007 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73599\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73599 \">image 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62850\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62850 \">image 4</a>). Distal phalanx fractures, which often result from crush injuries, are common as well (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81982\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef81982 \">image 5</a>). Spiral fractures often demonstrate angulation, rotation, and shortening (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81790\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef81790 \">image 6</a>), and may be comminuted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F108680\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108680 \">image 7</a>). Angulation and displacement may occur with transverse fractures, but these fractures are generally more stable.</p><p>Foot trauma often causes a fracture of more than one phalanx or toe. Therefore, it is important to read each radiograph systematically, and not to stop reading after the first fracture site is identified. Images of adjacent phalanges and toes should be carefully examined for evidence of fractures. Toe fractures are often comminuted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F108680\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108680 \">image 7</a>), particularly those of distal phalanges (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F50747\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50747 \">image 8</a>). Intra-articular fractures are also relatively common (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56400\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56400 \">image 9</a>) and are at higher risk for long-term complications such as arthritis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3225397326\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of toe fractures is made by diagnostic imaging. In the large majority of cases, plain radiographs are sufficient. In rare cases, additional views or more advanced techniques may be needed to delineate concomitant injuries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1143387398\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Toe fractures typically result from direct trauma to a digit and are readily diagnosed with plain radiographs. However, trauma may cause injuries other than fractures. In some cases, minor trauma may be incidental and toe pain may be due to an acute exacerbation of other, possibly chronic, conditions. Alternative diagnoses to consider include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Toe dislocation &ndash; A toe dislocation is usually obvious on examination, and results from a hyperextension or kicking injury. Plain radiographs establish the diagnosis and are important to obtain to evaluate for a concomitant fracture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digit-dislocation-reduction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Digit dislocation reduction&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First metatarsophalangeal joint sprain (Turf toe) &ndash; &quot;Turf toe&quot; is caused by a forceful hyperextension of the great toe that damages the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint capsule and ligaments. Patients complain of pain at the plantar surface of the first MTP joint that increases with passive extension or resisted flexion of the great toe. Some degree of swelling, discoloration, and focal tenderness around the MTP is common. Plain radiographs are typically normal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults#H2787992174\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of common causes of forefoot pain in adults&quot;, section on 'First metatarsophalangeal joint sprain (&quot;turf toe&quot;)'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hallux rigidus (osteoarthritis of first toe) &ndash; Patients with hallux rigidus present with pain, stiffness, and if there has been recent trauma possibly swelling of the first MTP joint. Pain may be aggravated by walking or repetitive toe extension. Plain radiographs reveal loss of joint space at the first MTP joint and possibly osteophytes, but no fracture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults#H3942165419\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of common causes of forefoot pain in adults&quot;, section on 'Hallux rigidus'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gout &ndash; Attacks of gout involving the first MTP joint cause an acute onset of pain, swelling, and redness at the joint. Plain radiographs may reveal typical findings but no fracture. Definitive diagnosis requires synovial fluid analysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gout&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection and osteomyelitis &ndash; Soft tissue infections involving a toe typically present as a painful, red, swollen digit, and may be unrelated to trauma. If not managed appropriately, such infections can lead to osteomyelitis. Fever, erythema, and warmth are generally not associated with toe fractures, although local discoloration can develop. No fracture is present on plain radiographs, although bony erosions and possibly periosteal elevation may be present if osteomyelitis has developed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of osteomyelitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR ORTHOPEDIC CONSULTATION OR REFERRAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Referral is indicated for emergency conditions, most fractures involving the great toe, and some specific conditions associated with fractures of the lesser toes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Emergency referral</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Emergency conditions requiring immediate referral include circulatory compromise, grossly contaminated wounds, and open fractures of the proximal phalanx [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toe-fractures-in-adults/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>]. Such injuries are usually machine-related, perhaps involving a lawnmower, chainsaw, or heavy weight, and frequently involve multiple digits. Patients who have sustained these injuries should be managed in accordance with the principles of advanced trauma life support (ATLS), including a thorough examination of the entire lower extremity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">General indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most open fractures of the distal phalanx can be managed by primary care or emergency physicians, but these injuries require special attention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toe-fractures-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>Unless the clinician is experienced in caring for such injuries, these patients should be referred to an orthopedist or podiatrist. This is especially true if the wound is contaminated or the patient is diabetic or otherwise immunocompromised. Complications from a toe fracture, such as chronic pain, nonunion, or osteomyelitis should be referred as well. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the diabetic foot&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-fracture-management-early-and-late-complications#H21949930\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of fracture management: Early and late complications&quot;, section on 'Nonunion and malunion'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of osteomyelitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Great toe fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Decreased function of the great toe can have a significant impact on a patient's life, given the toe's crucial role in balance and the toe-off phase of locomotion. Consequently, referral is more common for great toe fractures than for lesser toe fractures. Referral for management of great toe fractures should be made in the following circumstances:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fracture with dislocation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Displaced intraarticular fractures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unstable, displaced fractures (ie, fractures initially reduced that immediately displace once traction is released unstable displaced fractures) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toe-fractures-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]</p><p/><p>In addition, non-displaced intraarticular fractures that involve more than 25 percent of the joint space (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77329\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77329 \">image 10</a>) are generally referred. These injuries may lead to degenerative joint disease, especially if anatomic position is lost before healing occurs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Lesser toe fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Referral is rarely required for fractures of lesser toes (ie, toes other than the great toe). However, referral is indicated in the following situations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Displaced intraarticular fractures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Irreducible fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toe-fractures-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Open fractures of non-distal phalanges (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Emergency referral'</a> above)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fractures that do not maintain acceptable position with buddy taping</p><p/><p>No guidelines defining acceptable fracture position have been published; clinicians must determine acceptability on the basis of clinical judgment, visual inspection, and radiograph appearance. Functional outcome is the most important criterion when making this decision. Excessive angulation or rotation in any direction can create pressure on the toe from an adjacent toe or shoe surface leading to pain and tissue breakdown.</p><p>Approximate radiographic guidelines for excessive angulation or rotation are as follow:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More than 20 degrees of angulation in the dorsal-plantar (sagittal) plane</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More than 10 degrees of angulation in the medial-lateral (transverse) plane</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More than 20 degrees of rotational deformity</p><p/><p>Referral is usually not necessary for non-displaced intraarticular fractures of the lesser toes, even if they involve more than 25 percent of the joint surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toe-fractures-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This approach is supported by the results of an observational study of 339 consecutive patients with toe fractures in which the outcome for the 122 patients (33 percent) with intraarticular fractures was identical to those with fractures not involving the joint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toe-fractures-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment will vary according to the location and characteristics of the fracture.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Non-displaced fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immobilization by taping the injured toe to the adjacent toe (buddy taping) is the appropriate initial management (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74291\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74291 \">figure 4</a>). Some use a basket weave technique for added stability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toe-fractures-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A piece of cotton or felt should be placed between the toes to avoid maceration. A rigid-soled shoe or surgical cast shoe aids in immobilization and comfort. Athletic and walking shoes provide inadequate immobilization, and their use is discouraged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toe-fractures-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Patients with pain inadequately controlled with buddy taping, may require a short-leg walking cast with a toe plate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76330\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76330 \">picture 1</a>). The injured toe should be immobilized until point tenderness has resolved, which usually requires four to six weeks. An additional two to four weeks may be needed before patients can tolerate a tight-fitting dress shoe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toe-fractures-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Application of ice and elevation of the foot above the level of the heart during the first few days after the injury will decrease inflammation, swelling, and pain. Care should be taken not to cause a cold-induced injury when applying ice. This can generally be accomplished by placing a layer of bandage or cloth between the ice and the skin, and limiting the application time to about 15 minutes at a time, followed by a respite of 20 to 30 minutes.</p><p>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> are usually sufficient to control pain, although narcotic analgesics may be required for great toe fractures, multiple fractures, or displaced fractures requiring reduction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-acute-fracture-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of acute fracture management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Injury to the nail bed</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nail bed injuries are seen frequently with distal phalanx fractures sustained from a fallen object. Subungual hematomas can cause severe pain, often indicate the presence of a distal phalanx fracture, and should be drained if seen within the first 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toe-fractures-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Dorsal decompression of the hematoma may be performed using electrocautery, or possibly a scalpel. The toenail should be left in place because it provides additional support for the fracture. The management of subungual hematoma, including trephination techniques, is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subungual-hematoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subungual hematoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Treatment of nail bed lacerations is controversial. Some recommend removing the nail to detect the presence of a laceration, if there is significant traumatic deformity of the nail or a sizable subungual hematoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toe-fractures-in-adults/abstract/3,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9,10</a>]. They advocate laceration repair with absorbable sutures, following irrigation, if the wound is less than eight hours old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toe-fractures-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The primary justification for this approach lies in the high correlation between nail bed injury and distal phalanx fracture, with the consequent risk of osteomyelitis associated with open fractures. Others, citing data showing no difference in outcome, advocate against removal of the nail and nail bed laceration repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toe-fractures-in-adults/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. We do not advocate routine toenail removal and nail bed laceration repair, and perform this procedure only when obvious malalignment of the nail bed laceration is present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Displaced fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many displaced toe fractures can be handled by non-specialists. The indications for orthopedic referral are outlined above. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Indications for orthopedic consultation or referral'</a> above.)</p><p>The goal of displaced fracture management is to achieve anatomic alignment with restoration of length and correction of rotational deformity. The toe should first be anesthetized by either the application of ice for 20 minutes or a digital nerve block. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digital-nerve-block\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Digital nerve block&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Before the fracture is reduced, the clinician should briefly consider the major force involved in creating the injury. Reduction consists of moving the fracture fragments in the opposite direction of this force.</p><p>A pencil-sized object placed in the web space can provide stability and act as a fulcrum to facilitate reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toe-fractures-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Reduction generally consists of distracting the fracture fragments, maintaining constant distraction while moving the fragments back into alignment, and holding the reduction in place until the injury is immobilized. If the fracture is not readily reduced, the deformity may need to be <strong>increased</strong> slightly before reattempting reduction. Irreducible fractures may have soft tissue interposed between fragments requiring open reduction in the operating room.</p><p>Following reduction, the orientation of the nail bed of the fractured toe should be compared with that of the corresponding toe on the opposite, uninjured foot to rule out uncorrected rotational deformity.</p><p>Reduced, stable fractures in lesser toes (ie, not the great toe) are supported by taping them to the adjacent toe (ie, buddy taping). Traction should be maintained on the injured lesser toe while buddy taping (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74291\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74291 \">figure 4</a>) is performed. This approach usually provides adequate immobilization for lesser toe fractures following reduction. Some advocate a basket weave style of buddy taping for added stability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toe-fractures-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>After reduction of great toe fractures, traction should be released to determine stability. Stable fractures maintain their position after traction is released. If the fracture is stable, place the foot with the fracture in a walking cast with a toe plate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76330\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76330 \">picture 1</a>). This helps to reduce pain and decreases the risk of displacement. Great toe fractures that are unstable (ie, reduction is lost once traction is released) should be referred to a surgeon, as operative reduction and fixation may be necessary. Transverse fractures are more likely to be stable because they are better able to resist the deforming forces of muscular attachments. Oblique, spiral, and comminuted fractures are more likely to be unstable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toe-fractures-in-adults/abstract/3,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,13</a>]. Post-reduction radiographs are recommended to assure acceptable alignment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Open fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complex open fractures should be referred. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Indications for orthopedic consultation or referral'</a> above.)</p><p>For simple open fractures involving the distal phalanx, thorough cleaning and irrigation with a large amount (approximately 150 mL or more) of isotonic saline through a syringe (ie, under pressure) is the most important component of management. The management of minor skin wounds in preparation for wound closure is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minor-wound-preparation-and-irrigation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Minor wound preparation and irrigation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As long as the wound is not grossly contaminated, skin edges may be loosely approximated using several sutures. Although research is limited, many physicians treat such wounds with prophylactic antibiotics against common skin bacteria for a few days. We suggest prophylactic antibiotics for at least 48 hours after injury, and if no signs of infection develop antibiotics may be discontinued. The use of antibiotic prophylaxis for all types of open fractures is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-osteomyelitis-following-trauma-in-adults#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of osteomyelitis following trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Antibiotic therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Patients should be asked about tetanus immunization and appropriate treatment should be provided if they are inadequately immunized (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61087\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61087 \">table 1</a>). Common signs of infection should be reviewed with the patient and they should be told to return if any such signs develop. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetanus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tetanus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In settings where orthopedic referral is not readily available, primary care physicians are sometimes called upon to manage more complicated open toe fractures. A common scenario is a shear injury that partially or completely detaches the distal soft tissue, leaving bone exposed. The goal in such cases is to clean the wound and re-approximate the soft tissue so as to cover any visible bone. Such injuries may be managed as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perform a digital block. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digital-nerve-block\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Digital nerve block&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Irrigate the wound with a large amount of isotonic saline (150 mL or more). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minor-wound-preparation-and-irrigation#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Minor wound preparation and irrigation&quot;, section on 'Irrigation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Debride the wound of any visibly contaminated tissue. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minor-wound-preparation-and-irrigation#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Minor wound preparation and irrigation&quot;, section on 'Debridement'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loosely close the soft tissue over the bone with a few sutures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Closure of minor skin wounds with sutures&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Skin edges can be reapproximated, but it is common to leave soft tissue exposed to heal by secondary intention. If loosely sutured back into place, even completely avulsed flaps of skin may heal. If not, they at least provide a temporary physiologic dressing.</p><p>With some injuries, tissue loss is extensive and visible bone cannot be covered or bone fragments protrude. This may be managed by using a rongeur to remove small pieces of the bone a bit at a time until all visible bone can be covered by the remaining soft tissue. This procedure is typically well-tolerated provided the digital block is effective and only small pieces of bone are removed at a time.</p><p>Prophylactic antibiotics should be given and the patient instructed to be extremely conscientious about keeping the extremity elevated and seeking medical care immediately for any sign of infection. Ideally, wound checks are performed every two to three days until healing is well established. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-osteomyelitis-following-trauma-in-adults#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of osteomyelitis following trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Antibiotic therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP CARE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H962081010\"><span class=\"h2\">General guidelines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immobilization with buddy-taping (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74291\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74291 \">figure 4</a>) is generally recommended for four to six weeks after injury. Cast immobilization, if necessary, is maintained for two to three weeks, with subsequent buddy-taping continued for three to four weeks after cast removal. Follow-up examination and radiograph schedules vary according to the type of injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Closed injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial follow-up should occur one to two weeks following a closed injury. Follow-up radiographs are not necessary in most patients; they are recommended every 7 to 10 days to assess alignment <strong>only</strong> for fractures that required reduction or extended into the joint. Close follow-up is particularly important for fractures of the great toe, as malalignment of this toe can have significant consequences. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Open injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Open injuries require more careful initial monitoring for signs of infection. Initial wound reassessment should take place three to five days after the injury. Sutures are removed and radiographs taken to evaluate for signs of osteomyelitis approximately 14 days after the injury. Thereafter, radiographs can be repeated every two weeks until the wound is healed, or sooner if the patient is symptomatic (eg, fever, focal erythema or discharge).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Post-immobilization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gentle range of motion (ROM) exercises should begin once the toe is no longer immobilized. Comparing ROM of the toes on the affected and unaffected sides will help patients to assess their progress. Post-immobilization radiographs are usually unnecessary, unless the fracture involves the great toe, the patient does not improve as expected, or the patient continues to have pain and difficulty walking after the four to six-week recovery period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toe-fractures-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The radiographic hallmark of healing is callus at the fracture site (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59473\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59473 \">image 11</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications from toe fractures are unusual. Degenerative changes can result from fractures involving the joint surfaces. This may lead to chronic pain and decreased activity. Malunion (ie, incomplete healing or healing of fragments in an unacceptable position) can cause similar morbidity. Achieving anatomic alignment of the great toe is especially important to avoid chronic pain and disability. There is little disability associated with degenerative changes or decreased range of motion in the lesser toes. Mild angulation of the lesser toes is usually well tolerated, unless friction occurs with an adjacent toe, the ground, or the top of a shoe. Osteomyelitis can occur after an open fracture, and neurovascular injuries are sometimes seen after crush injuries or lacerations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-fracture-management-early-and-late-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of fracture management: Early and late complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">RETURN TO WORK OR SPORTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with great toe fractures that are intraarticular, unstable, or potentially unstable should be discouraged from stressing the toe until the injury is healed (ie, point tenderness has resolved and callus is seen on follow-up radiographs) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59473\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59473 \">image 11</a>). For other toe fractures, patients should be encouraged to advance activities as their symptoms allow. Patients vary widely in the speed with which they resume regular activities. Immobilization for three to four additional weeks (ie, total period of immobilization seven to nine weeks) may be required in patients who plan to return to sports or other demanding physical activities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed.

We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on &quot;patient info&quot; and the keyword(s) of interest.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Basics topic (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toe-fracture-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: Toe fracture (The Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Toe fractures are common, their management is usually straightforward, and treatment results are generally good. Summary recommendations are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Axial loading, abduction, and crush injury are the primary mechanisms for toe fracture. Patients typically present because of pain, difficulty walking, or inability to fit comfortably into a shoe. In patients with sensory neuropathy (eg, diabetes), presentation may be delayed. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of injury'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation and examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ecchymosis and swelling are usually present and develop within the first few hours after injury. Subungual hematoma is a common finding with distal toe fractures. Comparison of nail bed rotation between the injured toe and the corresponding uninjured toe is useful to assess rotational deformity. All injuries should be assessed for neurovascular function and the presence of an open fracture. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation and examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Standard radiographs should be obtained if a toe fracture is suspected. Many foot injuries involve fractures of more than one phalanx or toe. Thus, it is important to read each radiograph systematically searching for additional bony injuries. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis for toe fracture includes toe dislocation and sprain of the first metatarsophalangeal joint (ie, turf toe), either of which may involve a concomitant fracture, gout, and other conditions. (See <a href=\"#H1143387398\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Referral is indicated for emergency conditions (eg, multiple open or grossly contaminated fractures) and often for fractures involving the great toe. Fractures of the lesser toes typically do not need referral unless they are displaced and intraarticular or displaced and irreducible or an acceptable reduction cannot be maintained. Guidelines for acceptable fracture rotation or angulation of lesser toe fractures are provided in the text. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Indications for orthopedic consultation or referral'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial treatment varies according to the location and characteristics of the fracture. Many can be managed with basic immobilization. The goal when managing displaced fractures is to achieve anatomic alignment with restoration of length and correction of rotational deformity. Post-reduction assessment by radiograph and comparison with the corresponding uninjured toe is important. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Healing rates vary but generally range from four to six weeks. Follow-up examination and radiograph schedules vary according to the type of injury. Open injuries require close initial monitoring. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with great toe fractures that are intraarticular, unstable, or potentially unstable should be discouraged from stressing the toe until there is clinical and radiographic evidence of healing. Patients planning to return to vigorous work or sporting activities may require longer immobilization. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Return to work or sports'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The authors would like to thank Joni Jones, RT(R)(CT)(MR), Florida State University, for her invaluable assistance with the radiographic images.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toe-fractures-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Hatch RL, Rosenbaum CI.
