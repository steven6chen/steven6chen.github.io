The gap between allograft supply and demand continues to widen despite initiatives to expand the use of nonstandard deceased-donor allografts.</p><p>The use of organs from living donors is one strategy to address the need for transplants. However, rates of living kidney donation declined 15 percent from 2004 to 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-living-kidney-donor-candidate/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This trend is predominantly due to a decline in living, related donation. Although unrelated kidney donations have increased since 2007, the increase is not sufficient to compensate for the decline in living, related donation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-living-kidney-donor-candidate/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Recipients of allografts from living donors enjoy significant graft and patient survival advantages over those who receive deceased-donor grafts. In addition, living-donor transplants may be performed with minimal delay and controlled scheduling, which permits pre-emptive transplantation (transplantation prior to dialysis) or transplantation early in a recipient's course of renal failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for graft failure in kidney transplantation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dialysis issues prior to and after renal transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>While most donors experience good outcomes and have good quality of life after donation, kidney donation is associated with short- and longer-term risks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-living-kidney-donor-candidate/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Risks of donation include surgical, medical, psychosocial, and financial complications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-of-living-kidney-donation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk of living kidney donation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In February 2013, the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) implemented policy requirements for all living kidney donor recovery hospitals in the United States in order to promote consistency in the informed consent, medical and psychosocial evaluation, and follow-up of living donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-living-kidney-donor-candidate/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In 2014, these requirements were incorporated within global polices for living organ donors and modified in 2017 to include new risk information in required elements of informed consent. These policies define the minimum requirements for the evaluation and selection of living kidney donors in the US and are available <a href=\"http://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/media/1200/optn_policies.pdf&amp;token=kQy0OGGNdHdZjdbvjX6TpVtX5cjDLPOWZpZqeYq5C2knhfS67+QleVXZN0tlgbWOMzb+0o31D1m4b9E8nuj1BY9ftUWkm4DG8sNK0rpGYF4=&amp;TOPIC_ID=7315\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">online</a>.</p><p>OPTN requirements may be expanded upon in center-specific protocols to address topics not covered in OPTN mandates, including additional testing required on a case-by-case basis. Our approach is largely consistent with the 2017 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) &quot;Clinical Practice Guideline on the Evaluation and Care of Living Kidney Donors,&quot; which provides a framework for donor candidate evaluation grounded in simultaneous consideration of the <strong>combined</strong><em> </em>impact of each candidate's profile of demographic (ie, age, sex, and race) and health characteristics (eg, kidney function, blood pressure, body mass index, smoking status) on their risk of serious adverse outcomes after donation, most notably kidney failure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F114758\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114758 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-living-kidney-donor-candidate/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. To support this framework, an online risk tool was developed to estimate projected risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD; in the absence of donation) for donor candidates based on a profile of 10 demographic and health factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-living-kidney-donor-candidate/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>All donor candidates should be evaluated using the same criteria, regardless of whether donation is directed towards a designated recipient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-living-kidney-donor-candidate/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The evaluation of a living kidney donor candidate, including the OPTN requirements, is discussed here. The risks associated with living kidney donation are discussed elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-of-living-kidney-donation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk of living kidney donation&quot;</a>). The evaluation of the renal transplant recipient is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-potential-renal-transplant-recipient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the potential renal transplant recipient&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DONOR EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) requirements specify that the following be performed and documented prior to living kidney donation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-living-kidney-donor-candidate/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood typing (performed on two separate occasions before the recovery).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A medical evaluation (performed by a clinician or surgeon with experience in living donation).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A psychosocial evaluation (performed by a psychiatrist, psychologist, Masters-prepared social worker, or licensed clinical social worker).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Living-donor recovery hospitals must designate and provide each living-donor candidate with an Independent Living Donor Advocate (ILDA; one person or a team with a key contact) who is not involved with the potential recipient evaluation and is independent of the decision to transplant the potential recipient to ensure that the donor has received information on all phases of the donation process and to advocate for the rights of the donor. The OPTN ILDA requirements also fulfill the requirements of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).</p><p/><p>The 2017 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) living donor guideline offers a checklist to guide the evaluation, care, and follow-up of living kidney donors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F114754\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114754 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-living-kidney-donor-candidate/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>] and a summary of roles and responsibilities of members of the evaluation team (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F114756\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114756 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H359416160\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood typing and crossmatch</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of a living kidney donor candidate begins with an assessment of the donor and recipient blood groups and a crossmatch compatibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-living-kidney-donor-candidate/abstract/4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7</a>]. The blood type and crossmatch compatibility are the primary criteria for biological compatibility of the donor and recipient. OPTN policy requires prospective crossmatch testing of transplant candidates prior to placement of living-donor organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-living-kidney-donor-candidate/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>As per the 2013 OPTN requirements, the recovery hospital must ensure that ABO typing is performed on two separate occasions prior to donation and use source documents to register the living donor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-living-kidney-donor-candidate/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. If the initial subtype test indicates the donor to be blood type A, non-A1 or blood type AB, non-A1B, the recovery hospital must ensure that a second subtype determination test is performed prior to donation. The crossmatch between potential donor and recipient is done to detect preformed anti-donor antibodies in recipient blood that would cause early failure of the allograft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-living-kidney-donor-candidate/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Donor candidates who are ABO blood group or crossmatch incompatible with their intended recipient should be informed of the availability, risks, and benefits of treatment options, including kidney paired donation and incompatibility management strategies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-living-kidney-donor-candidate/abstract/3,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9</a>].</p><p>Issues surrounding ABO incompatibility and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) sensitization are discussed separately, with some programs offering transplantation across such barriers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hla-and-abo-sensitization-and-desensitization-in-renal-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HLA and ABO sensitization and desensitization in renal transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most kidney transplant programs routinely perform HLA typing to support counseling about projected graft survival and to optimize HLA matching in the event that there is more than one donor candidate. However, HLA matching between a particular donor and recipient is not required for successful transplantation. In some centers, HLA typing is not performed for most donors, because outcomes are acceptable even without HLA matching in the current era of improved immunosuppressive regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-living-kidney-donor-candidate/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>]. As an example, allograft survival with an unrelated, living donor is similar to that from a one-haplotype-matched, living donor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-living-kidney-donor-candidate/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Aside from HLA-identical twins, there are minimal differences in the survival of allografts from biologically related compared with unrelated donors under modern immunosuppression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=living-unrelated-donors-in-renal-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Living unrelated donors in renal transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As rhesus (Rh) antigens are not expressed on kidney tissue cell surfaces, this antigen system does not play a major role in allograft rejection, and matching for Rh antigens is not relevant in most settings. However some, though not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-living-kidney-donor-candidate/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], evidence suggests that Rh antigen mismatching may be associated with decreased allograft survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-living-kidney-donor-candidate/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In addition, female Rh-negative recipients of childbearing age may be at risk for sensitization when the donor is Rh positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-living-kidney-donor-candidate/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H191551081\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once a living-donor candidate is screened for blood type and crossmatch compatibility with the intended recipient, a thorough medical, surgical, and psychosocial evaluation is performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-living-kidney-donor-candidate/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Previously, donors candidates &gt;50 years of age were often not considered suitable. However, donor candidates age 50 years and older are now commonly accepted if these individuals are in good physical and mental condition and have adequate kidney function. For example, increased use of older donors was reflected in a 2005 survey of kidney transplant centers in the United States in which almost 60 percent of centers had no upper age limit for kidney donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-living-kidney-donor-candidate/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Among the remaining centers, an age limit of 75, 70, 65, 60, and 55 years was reported in 4, 5, 21, 7, and 1 percent, respectively. However the survival of renal allografts from donors older than 70 years is lower than those from younger donors. In addition, donors older than 60 years are more likely to have persistently reduced estimated GFR (eGFR) after nephrectomy to &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>. These data are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-of-living-kidney-donation#H3392911\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk of living kidney donation&quot;, section on 'Long-term risk'</a>.)</p><p>With regard to a lower age limit, most centers report that an age &lt;18 years is an absolute exclusion criterion. In the 2007 survey, for example, 77 percent of centers excluded prospective donors &lt;18 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-living-kidney-donor-candidate/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

From the perspective of international practice, KDIGO recommends use of eGFR from serum creatinine for initial assessment, followed by confirmation with one or more additional measurements, depending on availability: measured GFR, 24-hour creatinine clearance, eGFR from the combination of serum creatinine and cystatin C (eGFRcr-cys), or repeat eGFR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-living-kidney-donor-candidate/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The last option (ie, repeat eGFR) is the least preferred.</p><p>To support the guideline, a <a href=\"http://ckdepi.org/equations/donor-candidate-gfr-calculator/&amp;token=fQ3c+MpauhGIVTzo44uLuyyChvgeo72xvasgoihQnhOKjgrxkJozgepjoOWf/G8zzKxzdl9fqJx/csRuF1ouBg==&amp;TOPIC_ID=7315\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">web-based calculator</a> was developed to compute posttest probabilities for measured GFR above or below threshold probabilities for decision making [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-living-kidney-donor-candidate/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The tool has been validated in one study of donor candidates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-living-kidney-donor-candidate/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], suggesting that eGFR may be sufficiently accurate for decision making without the need for measured GFR in many cases. However, the use of eGFR alone is not recognized by OPTN policy, but a strategy of screening with eGFR followed by confirmation with 24-hour creatinine clearance or measured GFR can be efficient and policy compliant.

Within the United States, it is also mandated that patients meet with an Independent Living Donor Advocate (ILDA), whose role is to ensure that the donor candidate has received adequate information to make an informed decision and advocate for the rights of the living donor. The ILDA must function independently from the transplant candidate's team.
