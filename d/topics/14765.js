The distinction between two separate types of RILI, radiation pneumonitis and radiation fibrosis, was made in 1925 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-lung-injury/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Both types of lung injury are observed today in patients who have undergone thoracic irradiation for the treatment of lung, breast, or hematologic malignancies. Radiation-induced damage to normal lung parenchyma remains the dose-limiting factor in chest radiotherapy, and can involve other structures within the thorax in addition to the lungs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F79716\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79716 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>A large body of literature describes the histopathologic, biochemical, kinetic, physiologic, and molecular responses of lung cells to ionizing radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-lung-injury/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>]. However, the clinical diagnosis of RILI is often complicated by the presence of other conditions, including malignancy, infection, and cardiogenic pulmonary edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-lung-injury/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. RILI will be reviewed here. The cardiac, esophageal, chest wall, and brachial plexus effects of therapeutic radiation to the chest are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-breast-cancer-and-other-malignancies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiotoxicity of radiation therapy for breast cancer and other malignancies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-gastrointestinal-toxicity-of-radiation-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of gastrointestinal toxicity of radiation therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patterns-of-relapse-and-long-term-complications-of-therapy-in-breast-cancer-survivors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patterns of relapse and long-term complications of therapy in breast cancer survivors&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stereotactic-body-radiation-therapy-for-lung-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stereotactic body radiation therapy for lung tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ionizing radiation causes the localized release of sufficient energy to break strong chemical bonds and generate highly reactive free radical species. Cellular molecules including peptides, lipids, and DNA can be affected directly or indirectly via the interaction of the ionizing radiation with tissue water.</p><p>RILI results from the combination of direct cytotoxicity upon normal lung tissue and, perhaps more importantly, the development of fibrosis triggered by radiation-induced cellular signal transduction. The cytotoxic effect is largely a consequence of DNA damage that causes clonogenic death in normal lung epithelial cells, though apoptotic pathways are also induced by radiation. The development of fibrosis that can compromise lung function is mediated by a number of different cytokines, as discussed below.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Genetic background &ndash; </strong>Animal and human studies suggest that there is a significant role for genetic susceptibility to irradiation injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-lung-injury/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. Contemporary studies of patients receiving irradiation for breast cancer have shown suggestive associations between certain genetic factors and development of cutaneous telangiectasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-lung-injury/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fibrosis following irradiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-lung-injury/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Among 137 patients receiving irradiation for non-small cell or small cell lung cancer, presence of a single nucleotide polymorphism in the methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase gene (MTHFR; rs1801133) was associated with an increased risk of radiation pneumonitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-lung-injury/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In separate studies of lung cancer patients, polymorphisms of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene were associated with an increased risk of radiation pneumonitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-lung-injury/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Role of cytokines</strong> &ndash; Several cytokines are upregulated following lung irradiation and together are thought to mediate the pathologic changes described above.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Clinically, the most extensively studied radiation-induced cytokine is transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta), which can induce fibroblast collagen deposition. The plasma TGF-beta level at the end of a clinical course of radiotherapy has been observed to be a predictor of the risk of pneumonitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-lung-injury/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. This knowledge has been applied in a prospective trial in which patients with normal TGF-beta levels at the completion of a specified course of treatment were given additional boost treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-lung-injury/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Subsequent trials have shown no predictable pattern of TGF-beta change in those with and without radiation lung injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-lung-injury/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa) and interleukin 1-alpha (IL-1a), are upregulated immediately following irradiation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>IL-6 concentrations rise following irradiation, and elevated pretreatment plasma IL-6 concentrations correlate with an increased risk of developing RILI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-lung-injury/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), which are potent fibroblast mitogens are upregulated in animal models of lung irradiation injury prior to the development of histologically recognizable fibrosis along with TGF-beta 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-lung-injury/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Investigators have been able to reduce RILI and apoptosis in mice by the intravenous administration of bFGF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-lung-injury/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Basic fibroblast growth factor is thought to inhibit radiation-induced apoptosis in endothelial cells via activation of protein kinase C.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Interferon-gamma has been shown to reduce the number of neutrophils and the protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid following irradiation in a rat model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-lung-injury/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. It has the potential to reduce RILI via inhibition of both neutrophil accumulation and fibroblast collagen synthesis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>CD40 is displayed by antigen-presenting cells including B lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. These cells are activated in the presence of CD40 ligand-bearing cells, such as T lymphocytes, mast cells, and eosinophils. The role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of RILI is supported by the observation that anti-CD40 ligand antibodies significantly reduce the influx of inflammatory cells, collagen deposition, and septal thickening in a murine model of RILI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-lung-injury/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypersensitivity reaction &ndash; </strong>A less common and unpredictable lung injury has also been described that may involve areas of the lung <strong>outside</strong> the radiation port. Investigators have described a CD4+ lymphocytic alveolitis and increased gallium uptake in both irradiated and nonirradiated lung, consistent with a hypersensitivity pneumonitis-like reaction. The early development of a bilateral hypersensitivity reaction (as assessed by bronchoalveolar lavage) appears to be a common phenomenon following unilateral chest radiotherapy, but does not predict progression to clinically significant radiation pneumonitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-lung-injury/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-clinical-manifestations-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and clinical manifestations of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (extrinsic allergic alveolitis)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111791584\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathologic and clinical changes in the lung following irradiation may be divided into five phases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-lung-injury/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The immediate phase begins within hours to days following radiation exposure, and is generally asymptomatic. It is characterized by hyperemic, congested mucosa with leukocytic infiltration and increased capillary permeability, resulting in pulmonary edema. An exudative alveolitis follows, accompanied by tracheal bronchial hypersecretion and degenerative changes in the alveolar epithelium and endothelium. Type I alveolar epithelial cells (pneumocytes) are sloughed, and alveolar surfactant levels are increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-lung-injury/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the next phase (the latent phase), thick secretions accumulate due to an increase in the number of goblet cells combined with ciliary dysfunction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The third phase (acute exudative phase) is clinically referred to as radiation pneumonitis. It occurs 3 to 12 weeks following exposure and consists of sloughing of endothelial and epithelial cells, with narrowing of the pulmonary capillaries and microvascular thrombosis. Hyaline membranes form as a result of alveolar pneumocyte desquamation and leakage of a fibrin-rich exudate into the alveoli. Giant cells may be seen along the endothelium, and type II pneumocytes become hyperplastic with marked atypia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the fourth phase (intermediate phase), there may be resolution of the alveolar exudate and dissolution of the hyaline membranes, or there may be collagen deposition by fibroblasts, which results in thickening of the interstitium. Fibroblasts, probably of bone marrow origin, migrate into and proliferate within the alveolar walls and spaces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-lung-injury/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A final phase consists of fibrosis. It may be evident as early as six months following irradiation, and can progress over years. There is an increase in the number of myofibroblasts within the interstitium and alveolar spaces, along with an increase in collagen. The anatomic narrowing of alveolar spaces results in diminishing lung volume; vascular subintimal fibrosis and distortion cause a loss of capillaries. Traction bronchiectasis, complicated by chronic infection, can develop. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bronchiectasis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of bronchiectasis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>A histopathologic appearance consistent with organizing pneumonia has also been reported approximately 3 to 17 months after radiotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-lung-injury/abstract/31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-34</a>]. Organizing pneumonia can be seen in areas outside the radiation port, including the contralateral lung.

More specialized techniques of CRT include intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-techniques-in-cancer-treatment#H654912\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation therapy techniques in cancer treatment&quot;, section on 'Stereotactic radiation therapy techniques'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-techniques-in-cancer-treatment#H1070824621\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation therapy techniques in cancer treatment&quot;, section on 'Intensity-modulated radiation therapy'</a>.)</p><p>The impact of these technical changes on RILI has not been completely clarified. However, growing evidence supports IMRT for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a secondary analysis of the NRG Oncology clinical trial (RTOG 0617) that included 482 patients with locally advanced NSCLC, IMRT was administered to 227 patients and 3D-CRT to 255 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-lung-injury/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Two-year overall survival, progression-free survival, local failure, and distant metastasis-free survival were not different between the groups, but the rate of grade 3 pneumonitis was less with IMRT (7.9 versus 3.5 percent, p = 0.039). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-stage-iii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer#H11658993\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of stage III non-small cell lung cancer&quot;, section on 'Administration of radiation'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective study of chemoradiation for NSCLC, rates of pneumonitis from two secular periods were compared [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-lung-injury/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In the earlier period, patients received 3D-CRT, while in the later period, 4D (includes lung movement with respiration) IMRT was used. Chemotherapeutic approach did not change. Patients in the later period had a significantly lower volume of lung receiving more than 20 Gy (V<sub>20</sub>) and a lower mean lung dose (MLD) and were less likely to develop pneumonitis than patients treated earlier. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2944490509\"><span class=\"h3\">Stereotactic body radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinically significant radiation pneumonitis develops in fewer patients (5 to 15 percent) treated with SBRT compared with conventional radiation therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-lung-injury/abstract/38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-41</a>]. This is likely attributable to lower irradiated lung volumes and a lower mean lung dose. The risk of RILI increases once the V<sub>20</sub> exceeds 10 percent or the mean lung dose is higher than 6 Gy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-lung-injury/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Thus, the increased accuracy of newer radiation models appears to reduce global measures of lung irradiation and radiation pneumonitis as well.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1763179689\"><span class=\"h3\">Proton beam therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of protons rather than photons may decrease the incidence of radiation pneumonitis as the mass of protons limits tissue penetration and allows more precise dosing. In a systematic review of proton beam therapy for breast cancer, 1 of 102 (&lt;1 percent) patients across four studies developed radiation pneumonitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-lung-injury/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

In a phase 2 study of high dose proton therapy in combination with weekly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> for unresectable NSCLC, 1 of 44 treated patients developed pneumonitis, suggesting that high-dose proton therapy administered concurrently with chemotherapy is well-tolerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-lung-injury/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Volume of lung irradiated</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of radiation-induced injury is directly related to the volume of irradiated lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-lung-injury/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. In patients with breast cancer, for example, the risk of transient lung inflammation following adjuvant chest wall irradiation is approximately 5 percent. The risk is higher with increasing lung volume in the tangential fields, treatment to the regional lymph nodes (supraclavicular, axillary apex, and internal mammary regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-lung-injury/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]), and the use of concurrent compared with sequential chemotherapy (8.8 versus 1.3 percent in one series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-lung-injury/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In one report, when tangential beam irradiation was utilized following breast-conserving surgery, pneumonitis was observed only when &gt;10 percent of the lung was irradiated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-lung-injury/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

As noted above, MLD can be a predictor of the risk of radiation pneumonitis, as can the V<sub>20</sub>, defined as the volume of normal lung (total lung volume minus planning target volume for radiotherapy) that receives more than 20 Gy. </p><p>In 2010, a group of physicians and physicists analyzed more than 70 articles as part of the QUANTEC series to determine the radiation dose and lung volumes that predict a greater risk of pneumonitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-lung-injury/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. They concluded that MLD and V<sub>20</sub> were the best supported for routine clinical practice and recommended keeping the V<sub>20</sub> to &lt;30 to 35 percent and MLD &lt;20 to 23 Gy to keep the risk of pneumonitis &lt;20 percent. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Time-dose factor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a systematic review, the use of twice daily fractionation appeared to reduce the risk of RILI compared with administration of the same total daily dose as a single fraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-lung-injury/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. However, in a study of 37 patients receiving radiation for NSCLC, 14 developed radiation pneumonitis, suggesting no benefit to the twice daily fractionation regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-induced-lung-injury/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].
