An individual experiencing depersonalization may report feeling like an automaton or as if in a dream or as if watching him- or herself in a movie. Depersonalized individuals may report the sense of being an outside observer of their mental processes or their body, or at its extreme, lacking a sense of self. Another common feature is hypoemotionality (emotional numbing or blunting) specifically detachment from feelings that an individual knows they have. They often report feeling a loss of agency over their thoughts, perceptions, and actions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3696638652\"><span class=\"h2\">Derealization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Derealization is a subjective sense of detachment or unreality regarding the world around them (eg, individuals or objects are experienced as unreal, dreamlike, foggy, lifeless, seen through a glass, bubble, or veil, or visually distorted).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H654263248\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of all patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">depersonalization/derealization</span> disorder (DDD) should incorporate elements of psychoeducation and supportive psychotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treating-depersonalization-derealization-disorder/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], including: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Education</strong> &ndash; Giving the condition a name and providing information about the nature and course of the disorder can help patients significantly, particularly since many may have struggled for years with misdiagnosis or inaccurate labeling of their symptoms.

These modalities have not been compared in randomized clinical trials of DDD patients. In our clinical experience, psychotherapy can reduce depersonalization and derealization associated with DDD, while medication has only been found efficacious for selected target symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treating-depersonalization-derealization-disorder/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

None of these psychotherapies have been tested in randomized clinical trials in comparison with placebo or compared with one another. </p><p>For most patients newly diagnosed with acute DDD, we suggest first-line treatment with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) over other psychotherapies. The focus of CBT for DDD is on normalizing the symptoms and their interpretation; blocking of ruminative thoughts surrounding the condition; resisting checking behaviors; and grounding exercises. Our clinical experience and an uncontrolled, prospective trial suggested CBT can reduce DDD symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treating-depersonalization-derealization-disorder/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

In our clinical experience, psychodynamic psychotherapy can be very helpful for the suggested subgroup. A case report illustrates such an approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treating-depersonalization-derealization-disorder/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

CBT should target symptoms of both co-occurring disorders. SSRIs and CBT are effective treatments for depression and anxiety disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=depersonalization-derealization-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis#H2022763\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Depersonalization/derealization disorder: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Comorbid conditions'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psychotherapy-of-depersonalization-derealization-disorder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psychotherapy of depersonalization/derealization disorder&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-of-depersonalization-derealization-disorder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy of depersonalization/derealization disorder&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-major-depression-in-adults-choosing-initial-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar major depression in adults: Choosing initial treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for generalized anxiety disorder in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although the only randomized trial of an SSRI for DDD did not find the SSRI to be efficacious compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treating-depersonalization-derealization-disorder/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], in our clinical experience, DDD will often lessen as the co-occurring disorder is treated, especially in the acute phase of the illness. Although head-to-head comparisons between psychotherapy alone and combined therapy and medication have not been made, it could reasonably argued that for any DDD patient with depression, medication is better started sooner than later. </p><p>As an example in treating depression concurrent with DDD, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paroxetine</a> can be used at an initial therapeutic dose of 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. If the response is insufficient after a trial of four to six weeks, trials at higher doses to a maximum of 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> can be tried. When treating anxiety, the SSRI is started at a low dose (eg, 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> to minimize the risk of feeling &ldquo;drugged,&rdquo; which is a common trigger that leads DDD patients to stop medications.</p><p>Common side effects of SSRIs include sexual dysfunction, nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, and withdrawal on discontinuation. SSRIs can also cause drug interactions, weight gain, and agitation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hyperactivation.

In the absence of data comparing the efficacy of these interventions, the selection between them can be made on the basis of patient preference and treatment availability. Specific medications are suggested for patient subgroups with certain clinical features.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4073515829\"><span class=\"h3\">Longer-term psychotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DDD patients with a partial response may, in our experience, benefit from longer-term psychotherapy addressing underlying conflicts and traumas for continued symptomatic improvement. After experiencing some benefit, the patient may actively seek out extended therapy or may be more open to considering it. As with any other condition, resistances to cognitive-behavioral or dynamic approaches may be more prominent in certain patients, and some become convinced they cannot function in the world, leading to a gradual steady decompensation. It is important, as with other conditions, to help patients see the value of maximizing functioning despite distressing symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H146559840\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypnotizable patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypnosis can be a useful tool for teaching patients with DDD that has not adequately responded to CBT in our experience. Hypnosis aims to modulate symptoms by helping the patient imagine being in situations that usually reduce or even exacerbate them. Often the struggle against depersonalization <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> derealization has the opposite effect of exacerbating it.<strong> </strong>Hypnosis can also be used to induce physical comfort and better manage stressors by dissociating them from their customary somatic responses (eg, picturing the stressor while imagining being in a physically comfortable situation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treating-depersonalization-derealization-disorder/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. There are no clinical trials testing the efficacy of hypnosis in patients with DDD. </p><p>Hypnosis for patients with DDD is typically provided in 10 60-minute sessions occurring weekly. A brief clinical test of hypnotizability such as the Hypnotic Induction Profile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treating-depersonalization-derealization-disorder/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] provides information about whether or not the patient is sufficiently hypnotizable to potentially benefit from the technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treating-depersonalization-derealization-disorder/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].

Lamotrigine can be started at 25 mg daily for the first two weeks of treatment, then increased to 50 mg daily for weeks 3 and 4. The dose is thereafter titrated to effect and tolerance. After week 4, the daily dose can be increased by 50 mg every one to two weeks. A common maintenance dose is 200 mg daily given in two divided doses, but total daily doses up to 400 mg given in two divided doses have been used.

In the absence of data comparing the efficacy of these interventions, the selection between them can be made on the basis of patient preference and treatment availability. (See <a href=\"#H3397145235\" class=\"local\">'Poor or partial response'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>DDD patients with a partial response to psychotherapy may, in our experience, benefit from longer-term psychotherapy addressing underlying conflicts and traumas for continued symptomatic improvement. (See <a href=\"#H4073515829\" class=\"local\">'Longer-term psychotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hypnosis can be a useful tool for teaching patients with DDD that has not adequately responded to CBT in our clinical experience. Hypnosis aims to modulate symptoms by helping the patient to imagine being in situations that usually reduce or even exacerbate them. Hypnosis can also be used to induce physical comfort and better manage stressors by dissociating them from their customary somatic responses. (See <a href=\"#H146559840\" class=\"local\">'Hypnotizable patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For many noncomorbid DDD patients with a poor or partial response to initial psychotherapy, we suggest a trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamotrigine</a> rather than other medications (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Data are inadequate to guide the duration of medication treatment for<strong> </strong>DDD, but based on our experience, DDD patients who respond to medication should continue it for a minimum of 6 to 12 months. (See <a href=\"#H1303582661\" class=\"local\">'Medication strategies'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-of-depersonalization-derealization-disorder#H1125592882\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy of depersonalization/derealization disorder&quot;, section on 'Lamotrigine'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For DDD patients with pronounced hypoemotionality that does not respond adequately to psychotherapy or SSRIs, we suggest a trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomipramine</a> rather than other medications (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naltrexone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naltrexone</a> would be a reasonable alternative. (See <a href=\"#H331423919\" class=\"local\">'Emotional numbing'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-of-depersonalization-derealization-disorder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy of depersonalization/derealization disorder&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with chronic, treatment refractory DDD can benefit from supportive psychotherapy that addresses occupational and social functioning, and alleviating to the degree possible the severe distress often associated with the disorder. Transcranial magnetic stimulation can also be considered in patients with treatment refractory DDD.
