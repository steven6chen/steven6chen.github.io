In addition, many RCCs are clinically silent for much of their course, and the initial diagnosis can be delayed until disease is either locally advanced and unresectable or metastatic. The natural history of disease for patients with advanced or metastatic RCC can vary widely from a few months to many years depending on the clinical, pathologic, laboratory, and radiographic features of disease, as well as the response to therapy.</p><p>Understanding the molecular pathogenesis of RCC has identified targets for therapeutic intervention (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F76708\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76708 \">figure 1</a>) and led to the development of multiple agents that have an important role in the management of patients with advanced RCC. Antiangiogenic and molecularly targeted agents and their application in patients with advanced RCC will be reviewed here, with the primary focus on the treatment of clear cell RCC because much of the data have been derived from clinical trials in these patients.</p><p>An overview of the treatment approach to RCC, prognostic factors in RCC, and the role of immunotherapy are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-bladder-cancer-in-older-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of bladder cancer in older adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunotherapy-of-renal-cell-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunotherapy of renal cell carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MOLECULAR PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 65 to 75 percent of renal epithelial tumors are clear cell carcinomas; other important subtypes include papillary (chromophilic), chromophobe, collecting duct, and medullary carcinomas, as well as oncocytomas. The different RCC subtypes are increasingly being characterized by unique genetic abnormalities and associated gene expression patterns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiangiogenic-and-molecularly-targeted-therapy-for-advanced-or-metastatic-clear-cell-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The pathogenesis of clear cell carcinoma is the best understood. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-renal-cell-carcinoma#H403324821\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathology, and pathogenesis of renal cell carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Genetic alterations in clear cell carcinoma'</a>.)</p><p>The initial insights into the molecular pathogenesis of clear cell RCC came from studies on Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. VHL is characterized by the development of cerebellar and spinal hemangioblastomas, retinal angiomas, pheochromocytomas, and renal cysts and tumors. Clear cell RCCs develop in 40 to 60 percent of patients with VHL disease; these tend to be multicentric and bilateral with an unusually early age of onset. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and management of von Hippel-Lindau disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Genetic analyses of VHL-associated RCCs showed loss of heterozygosity at the VHL locus on chromosome 3p25, and the same abnormality is present in 75 to 80 percent of sporadic clear cell RCCs. These findings implicated the VHL gene in the pathogenesis of clear cell RCCs. This abnormality results in the overproduction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-biology-and-pathogenesis-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular biology and pathogenesis of von Hippel-Lindau disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>VEGF is probably the most important growth factor that is involved in tumor angiogenesis, and it plays a significant role in the growth and progression of many types of human cancer, including RCC. Elucidation of the downstream pathways from the VEGF receptor has defined a number of targets for interruption of the signaling that results in angiogenesis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F76708\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76708 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H97678800\" class=\"local\">'Inhibitors of the VEGF pathway'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-angiogenesis-inhibitors#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of angiogenesis inhibitors&quot;, section on 'VEGF receptors'</a>.)</p><p>An alternative pathway is mediated by the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), which is downstream of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase and Akt and is regulated by the phosphatase and tensin homolog (<em>PTEN</em>) tumor suppressor gene. Inhibition of this pathway leads to decreased protein translation and inhibition of both angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Inhibitors of the mTOR pathway'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H471560809\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF APPROACH TO TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The integration of antiangiogenic and molecularly targeted therapy into the overall management of patients with advanced clear cell RCC and its timing relative to checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy are discussed in detail separately.
