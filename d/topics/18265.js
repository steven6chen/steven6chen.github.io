Community surveys in 14 countries have estimated that the lifetime prevalence of unipolar depressive disorders is 12 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-and-initial-treatment-investigational-approaches/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], and the World Health Organization ranks unipolar major depression as the 11<sup>th</sup> greatest cause of disability and mortality in the world, among 291 diseases and causes of injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-and-initial-treatment-investigational-approaches/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Following recovery from one major depressive episode, the estimated rate of recurrence over two years is greater than 40 percent; after two episodes, the risk of recurrence within five years is approximately 75 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-and-initial-treatment-investigational-approaches/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>In addition, initial treatment of unipolar major depression is often unsuccessful.

Several of the drugs (eg, creatine and sarcosine) are mentioned only for informational purposes because they have been investigated in only one trial and the results need to be replicated before we can suggest using them routinely. Some studies were problematic in that they analyzed study completers (per protocol analysis), which can potentially bias the results, rather than analyzing all patients who were randomized (intent to treat analysis). In addition, many of these drugs are adjunctive therapies, and adherence to treatment may be worse with medication combinations than monotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-and-initial-treatment-investigational-approaches/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Another problem is the lack of longer (eg, &ge;8 weeks) trials to evaluate the benefits and risks; continuation and maintenance treatment generally consists of the regimen used for initial treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84007081\"><span class=\"h3\">Antiglucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antiglucocorticoid drugs (ie, agents that either act as an antagonist at the glucocorticoid receptor or directly inhibit cortisol production) such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a> are rarely if ever used for the initial treatment of nonpsychotic depression. Evidence for the efficacy of antiglucocorticoids is based upon small trials that included patients with bipolar depression as well as unipolar depression, and there are insufficient data about safety concerns and adverse effects, as well as long-term benefits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-and-initial-treatment-investigational-approaches/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84007203\"><span class=\"h3\">Creatine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Creatine may possibly be useful as short-term, adjunctive treatment with antidepressants to treat unipolar major depression. An eight-week randomized trial compared creatine monohydrate (5 g per day) plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=escitalopram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">escitalopram</a> (10 to 20 mg per day) with placebo plus escitalopram in 52 women with unipolar major depression (mostly first episode) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-and-initial-treatment-investigational-approaches/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Exclusion criteria included comorbid renal disease and serum creatinine levels that exceeded the normal range (&gt;1.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span>. Remission occurred in more patients who received adjunctive creatine than placebo (52 versus 26 percent). Adverse events were comparable for the two groups, and serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels were within normal limits during the trial.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1438867697\"><span class=\"h3\">Dehydroepiandrosterone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The androgen dehydroepiandrosterone may improve depressive syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-and-initial-treatment-investigational-approaches/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>], but there is limited evidence about the safety and long-term effectiveness of dehydroepiandrosterone. Evidence for the efficacy of dehydroepiandrosterone includes a six-week randomized trial that compared dehydroepiandrosterone monotherapy (30 mg three times daily for three weeks, followed by 150 mg three times daily for three weeks) with placebo in 46 patients with major or minor depression who completed the study; response (reduction of baseline symptoms &ge;50 percent) occurred in more patients who received dehydroepiandrosterone than placebo (45 versus 13 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-and-initial-treatment-investigational-approaches/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Side effects were not reported. However, acne and hirsutism have been described in women participating in longer-term trials of dehydroepiandrosterone for indications other than depression.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H68883703\"><span class=\"h3\">Lamotrigine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lamotrigine</a> is not useful for unipolar major depression.

The role of lithium in treating unipolar depression is discussed separately.

Limited evidence for the efficacy of modafinil includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A six-week randomized trial compared <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">modafinil</a> (200 mg twice per day) plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a> (40 mg per day) with placebo plus fluoxetine in the 44 patients with unipolar major depression who completed the trial (out of 46 who were initially randomized) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-and-initial-treatment-investigational-approaches/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

A meta-analysis of five randomized trials lasting 12 to 24 weeks compared add-on N-acetylcysteine (2 to 3 grams per day) with placebo in 574 patients with depressive symptoms that occurred in the context of unipolar major depression, bipolar disorder, trichotillomania, or smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-and-initial-treatment-investigational-approaches/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Improvement of depressive symptoms was greater in patients who received adjunctive N-acetylcysteine than placebo, and the clinical benefit was small to moderate. However, heterogeneity across studies was substantial, and adverse events (eg, gastroesophageal reflux, musculoskeletal pain, and nausea) occurred more often with N-acetylcysteine (odds ratio 1.61, 95% CI 1.01-2.59).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84006745\"><span class=\"h3\">Omega-3 fatty acids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The benefit of omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids) for treating unipolar major depression is not clear, due to conflicting results from different meta-analyses of randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-and-initial-treatment-investigational-approaches/abstract/15-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-20</a>]. Heterogeneity across studies is typically substantial and publication bias may account for the benefits observed in some meta-analyses. </p><p>As an example, a meta-analysis of 25 randomized trials (n = 1373 patients with unipolar major depression) compared omega-3 fatty acids with placebo and found a small but statistically significant advantage for active drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-and-initial-treatment-investigational-approaches/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, the investigators concluded that the effect was probably not clinically meaningful and represented a difference of only about 2 points on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F72220\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef72220 \">form 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F60363\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef60363 \">form 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F73164\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef73164 \">form 3</a>), which ranges from 0 to 52. In addition, heterogeneity across studies was substantial, and publication bias probably skewed the analysis towards finding a beneficial effect for omega-3 fatty acids. </p><p>Three probable sources of variability in study outcomes are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severity of illness &ndash; Benefits of omega-3 fatty acids seem to occur in patients with moderate major depression rather than milder illness. Omega-3 fatty acids have not been systematically studied in severe depression (eg, psychotic, suicidal, or hospitalized patients).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eicosapentaenoic acid &ndash; It has been hypothesized that eicosapentaenoic acid is the key component in omega-3 fatty acid preparations, such that better outcomes for depression accrue to patients who are treated with larger amounts and proportions of eicosapentaenoic acid than docosahexaenoic acid. Evidence supporting this hypothesis includes a meta-analysis of 16 randomized trials (n &gt;6000 depressed patients) that found a significant, clinically small to moderate effect favoring eicosapentaenoic acid-predominant formulations of omega-3 fatty acids over placebo (heterogeneity across studies was moderate to large) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-and-initial-treatment-investigational-approaches/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. By contrast, a meta-analysis of 12 randomized trials (n &gt;3000) compared docosahexaenoic acid-predominant formulations with placebo and found that the benefits were comparable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, a meta-analysis of 18 randomized trials compared eicosapentaenoic acid-predominant formulations of omega-3 fatty acids with placebo in 969 patients who were diagnosed with depressive syndromes, and found a significant, clinically moderate to large effect favoring active treatment over placebo (heterogeneity across studies was moderate to large) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-and-initial-treatment-investigational-approaches/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. By contrast, a meta-analysis of eight randomized trials compared eicosapentaenoic acid-predominant formulations with placebo in 5038 patients with depressive symptoms, but without a formal diagnosis of depression, and found that the benefits of active treatment and placebo were comparable. In addition, no benefit was seen in meta-analyses of trials that compared docosahexaenoic acid-predominant formulations with placebo in patients diagnosed with depression, as well as trials in patients with undiagnosed depression. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammation &ndash; Response to eicosapentaenoic acid for depression may be greater in patients with high levels of inflammatory biomarkers (eg, interleukin-6 or C-reactive protein) than patients with low levels. An eight-week trial randomly assigned patients with unipolar major depression (n = 155) to eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, or placebo, and found that improvement for the three groups was comparable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-and-initial-treatment-investigational-approaches/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, in the subgroup of patients with high levels of inflammatory markers, improvement was greater with eicosapentaenoic acid than either docosahexaenoic acid or placebo.
