Less common causes include gastrointestinal bleeding, postoperative bleeding, and pulmonary hemorrhage. Sickle cell anemia complicated by sequestration crisis can result in physiologic complications similar to hemorrhagic shock. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of blunt abdominal trauma in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypovolemic shock develops when intravascular volume is insufficient to maintain tissue perfusion. Fluid losses may be strictly intravascular (eg, hemorrhage, third-space losses from intraabdominal processes [eg, pancreatitis, intussusception, appendicitis] or capillary leak), a combination of intravascular and extravascular (eg, burn injury), or primarily extravascular (eg, diarrheal disease). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-assessment-and-diagnosis-of-hypovolemia-dehydration-in-children#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical assessment and diagnosis of hypovolemia (dehydration) in children&quot;, section on 'Type of fluid lost'</a>.)</p><p>Initial compensation for volume depletion includes stimulation of thirst and fluid conservation by the kidneys. The following mechanisms come into play once perfusion becomes compromised [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypovolemic-shock-in-children-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tachycardia increases cardiac output.

Compensatory vasoconstriction maintains blood pressure at the expense of reduced tissue perfusion. As a result, hypovolemic shock progresses rapidly to cardiovascular collapse and cardiac arrest once hypotension develops. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-classification-of-shock-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and classification of shock in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hypovolemia can be classified by the degree of volume depletion, with patients in shock included in the most severe categories.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children with nonhemorrhagic losses, volume depletion is characterized as mild, moderate, or severe depending upon the percent loss of body weight: 3 to 5 percent (mild), 6 to 9 percent (moderate), and 10 percent or more (severe). Clinical features are typically used to estimate volume deficit since premorbid weight is usually not known (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76198\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76198 \">table 1</a>). Many children with moderate volume depletion and all of those with severe depletion have compromised perfusion and are in shock. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-assessment-and-diagnosis-of-hypovolemia-dehydration-in-children#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical assessment and diagnosis of hypovolemia (dehydration) in children&quot;, section on 'Degree of hypovolemia'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with hemorrhage can be categorized by severity into four classes based upon percent loss of blood volume. As with nonhemorrhagic losses, clinical features are typically used to estimate blood volume deficit (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F68694\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68694 \">table 2</a>). Many children with class II hemorrhage and all of those with classes III and IV are in shock. The approach to hemorrhage by class is as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Class I</strong> &ndash; Class I hemorrhage occurs with acute loss of up to 15 percent of the child's blood volume. Minimal physiologic changes are evident and patients usually respond well to crystalloid fluid replacement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Class II</strong> &ndash; Class II hemorrhage results from 15 to 30 percent blood loss. Physiologic changes include mild tachycardia and tachypnea with a narrow pulse pressure, slightly delayed capillary refill, decreased urine output, and mild anxiety. Patients can usually be stabilized with crystalloid solution, although they may require blood products.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Class III</strong> &ndash; Class III hemorrhage is the result of an acute blood loss of 30 to 40 percent. Signs of shock (including tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, delayed capillary refill, altered mental status, and oliguria) are present. Prompt resuscitation with crystalloid solution is necessary; most patients will need blood products as well.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Class IV</strong> &ndash; Class IV hemorrhage occurs with more than 40 percent acute blood loss. Signs of shock are obvious and immediately life-threatening. Patients are usually cold and pale with profoundly depressed mentation, marked tachypnea and tachycardia, and anuria. Children should quickly receive blood products. Operative intervention is often necessary to control hemorrhage.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical characteristics associated with imminent cardiovascular collapse must be quickly identified with an initial rapid assessment. Children who have been injured and have hemorrhagic hypovolemic shock may have associated injuries that require stabilization (ie, cervical spine immobilization for suspected neck injury or needle thoracostomy for tension pneumothorax). An approach to rapidly identifying the cause of shock based upon clinical findings is provided in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81356\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef81356 \">algorithm 1</a>).

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-of-shock-in-children#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation of shock in children&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a>.) </p><p>These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs of decreased cerebral perfusion (ie, poor tone, unfocused gaze, listlessness, or decreased responsiveness to caretakers or painful interventions)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs of poor peripheral perfusion (ie, decreased or absent distal pulses, cool extremities, prolonged capillary refill [&gt;2 seconds])</p><p/><p>Specific features of the physical examination that may be noted in children with hypovolemic shock include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children who are hypotensive with histories of trauma are likely in hemorrhagic shock. They must be carefully evaluated to identify sources of bleeding and associated injuries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64241\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64241 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with hypovolemic shock typically have narrow pulse pressures as the result of elevated diastolic pressure from increased systemic vascular resistance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs of significant volume loss may be less dramatic among children with hypertonic dehydration (as can occur with hypotonic fluid loss from conditions such as rotavirus gastroenteritis and diabetes insipidus). This is because the associated increase in serum osmolality pulls water out of the cells, initially minimizing the degree of extracellular fluid volume loss. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-assessment-and-diagnosis-of-hypovolemia-dehydration-in-children#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical assessment and diagnosis of hypovolemia (dehydration) in children&quot;, section on 'Type of fluid lost'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal distention, mass, or tenderness is consistent with an abdominal catastrophe, such as bowel obstruction, perforation, or peritonitis. Inflicted injury should be suspected in the absence of a history of trauma.

They may need to be replaced <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> treated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with moderate to severe burns are at increased risk of hypovolemia due to insensible losses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-children#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency care of moderate and severe thermal burns in children&quot;, section on 'Evaluation of burn injury'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Ancillary data</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of hypovolemic shock usually is based upon physical signs and symptoms. Once fluid therapy is initiated, ancillary data can be useful to detect associated electrolyte and acid-base abnormalities and to guide treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Laboratory evaluation</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypovolemic shock without hemorrhage</strong> &ndash; The following studies are suggested in children with hypovolemic shock without hemorrhage:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Rapid blood glucose</strong> &ndash; Children with hypovolemic shock from gastroenteritis are at risk for hypoglycemia. In contrast, pediatric trauma and burn victims commonly have hyperglycemia caused by physiologic stress. In some of these patients, the blood glucose can exceed 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (16.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> with the potential to cause an osmotic diuresis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypovolemic-shock-in-children-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Electrolyte levels</strong> &ndash; Abnormalities in serum sodium and potassium levels may occur among children with hypovolemic shock. Serum sodium concentrations are influenced by the type of fluid loss, secretion of antidiuretic hormone, and prior fluid replacement. Clinical features that affect serum potassium include type of fluid loss (ie, increased loss in diarrheal stool) and the degree of acidosis (with marked acidosis, serum potassium concentration may be increased). Serum and urine electrolyte testing in hypovolemia is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-assessment-and-diagnosis-of-hypovolemia-dehydration-in-children#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical assessment and diagnosis of hypovolemia (dehydration) in children&quot;, section on 'Laboratory testing'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Lactic acid</strong> &ndash; Lactic acid measurement may be helpful in the initial evaluation of shock. Lactate levels &gt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> are associated with increased mortality in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypovolemic-shock-in-children-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. When shock is masked by &ldquo;normal&rdquo; blood pressure for age, a blood lactic acid level &gt;4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> usually indicates shock, even without overt clinical signs of hypoperfusion. Hypoperfusion may be masked by normal blood pressure. Although evidence is limited in children, studies in adults show that initial lactate levels are better than blood pressure at predicting mortality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-sepsis-and-septic-shock-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of suspected sepsis and septic shock in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Urine dipstick </strong>&ndash; Rapid urine dipstick provides a quick measurement of the urine specific gravity, ketones, and glucose. Glycosuria with ketones suggests diabetic ketoacidosis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hemorrhagic hypovolemic shock</strong> &ndash; In addition to the studies suggested above, children with hemorrhagic hypovolemic shock warrant the following studies: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Hematocrit</strong> &ndash; Most children with hemorrhagic shock have acute blood loss. The initial hematocrit is typically normal because equilibration with extracellular fluid has not yet occurred. However, the hematocrit will drop with repeated measurements over time. Patients with hemorrhagic shock and a low initial hematocrit often have life-threatening hemorrhage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">In patients with hypovolemic shock primarily from fluid losses such as diarrhea, the hematocrit may be elevated due to hemoconcentration. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Coagulation studies (platelet count, PT, aPTT and INR, fibrinogen) &ndash; </strong>Coagulation studies are indicated in patients with ongoing hemorrhage and any of the following conditions:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Known or suspected thrombocytopenia (eg, post-chemotherapy, bone marrow transplant, ITP, etc) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Liver dysfunction </p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Anticoagulant therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Severe penetrating or blast trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypovolemic-shock-in-children-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Massive transfusion (volume of blood received equivalent to total blood volume), or with significant bleeding to the extent that their clotting ability has been diminished </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">The hemorrhage may not stop until coagulation parameters are corrected. Thus, evaluation of platelet count, PT, and PTT can assist in identifying coagulopathy and guiding correction with platelet infusion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fresh frozen plasma. Fibrinogen should also be checked in patients with liver dysfunction because cryoprecipitate may be needed to more effectively replace liver-dependent clotting factors (factors II, VII, IX, and X).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Type and cross match</strong> &ndash; Children with hemorrhagic shock may require urgent transfusion. Although typed and cross-matched blood products are preferred, they may take 30 to 45 minutes to prepare. Type-specific blood can usually be obtained within 15 to 20 minutes. Type O, Rh-negative blood for females and type O, Rh-negative or Rh-positive blood for males can be used for patients who require immediate transfusion. Hypocalcemia and coagulation abnormalities may develop in patients who require massive transfusion. Better outcomes may be achieved by ensuring coadministration of platelets and fresh frozen plasma as part of a massive transfusion protocol. The ratio of blood products and the indications for initiating such a protocol in children is discussed separately.

Thus, metabolic acidosis is typically present on arterial or venous blood gases. Metabolic acidosis can also be evident by lowered carbon dioxide measurements obtained by capnography. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carbon dioxide monitoring (capnography)&quot;, section on 'Detecting metabolic acidosis'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Other studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A chest radiograph can be useful to evaluate heart size for children with apparent hypovolemic shock who do not improve following the administration of 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of fluid. If the heart size is small, then additional bolus fluid administration is indicated. In contrast, if the heart is big, then fluid therapy should be moderated and additional types of shock (eg, septic or cardiogenic shock) may be present and warrant specific therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=septic-shock-in-children-rapid-recognition-and-initial-resuscitation-first-hour\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Septic shock in children: Rapid recognition and initial resuscitation (first hour)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-shock-in-children#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of shock in children&quot;, section on 'Specific management decisions'</a>.) </p><p>For patients with traumatic hemorrhagic shock, a chest radiograph may identify intrathoracic bleeding or other causes for shock, such as tension pneumothorax or pericardial effusion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;, section on 'Screening radiographs'</a>.)</p><p>For children with trauma, additional imaging (eg, focused assessment with sonography in trauma [FAST] or computed tomography) is typically warranted. The approach to imaging in the pediatric trauma patient is discussed separately.

Early positive pressure ventilation and intubation should be performed in patients with airway compromise or impending respiratory failure. A rapid overview provides the suggested approach to rapid sequence intubation in children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51456\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51456 \">table 3</a>).
