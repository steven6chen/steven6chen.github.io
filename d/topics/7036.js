The clinical syndrome (phenotype) is characterized by extremely elevated levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and a propensity to early onset atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. In general, homozygotes manifest the disease at a much earlier age than heterozygotes and the disease is more severe.</p><p>This topic will focus on the primary goal of therapy in FH adults: to significantly lower LDL-C levels. Other issues regarding FH in adults are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=familial-hypercholesterolemia-in-adults-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Familial hypercholesterolemia in adults: Overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The management of children and adolescents with heterozygous or homozygous FH is discussed separately.

The magnitude of benefit has varied in these studies due to differing populations, the end point chosen, as well as the intensity and duration of treatment. Reduction in combined end points of up to 50 percent have been found. </p><p>While all studies of the impact of therapy on mortality in FH patients have been observational, the results are consistent with the findings of randomized trials (usually with statins) that enrolled many individuals without FH. In the aggregate, these secondary prevention studies found a lowering of the risk for cardiovascular death and myocardial infarction.

Our general approach is intensive LDL-C lowering, with a minimal target of &lt;150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>.</p><p>In adult primary care or cardiology practice, most patients with a diagnosis of homozygous FH will have had treatment started in childhood.

Two studies found that monoclonal antibodies to PCSK9 effectively and safely lower LDL-C in individuals with homozygous FH as long as some LDL receptor function is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hypercholesterolemia-in-adults-treatment/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. In the larger TESLA Part B trial, 50 patients with FH on stable lipid lowering therapy were randomly assigned to subcutaneous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evolocumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">evolocumab</a> 420 mg or placebo every four weeks for 12 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hypercholesterolemia-in-adults-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Compared with placebo, evolocumab reduced LDL-C by 30.9 percent (95% CI -42.9 to -18.0 percent; p&lt;0.0001). However, the mean on-treatment LDL-C remained significantly elevated at 271 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. Ezetimibe has not been evaluated in this setting, and our recommendation for its use is based on clinical experience.</p><p>After therapy with statin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ezetimibe-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ezetimibe</a>, and a PCSK9 antibody, the LDL-C goal should be reevaluated and a determination made as to whether additional therapy should be added [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hypercholesterolemia-in-adults-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Many homozygous patients will require additional therapies to lower LDL-C, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mipomersen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mipomersen</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lomitapide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lomitapide</a>, liver transplantation, or LDL-C apheresis. These uncommonly used therapies are generally prescribed by a lipid specialist.

We recommend intensive lipid lowering for virtually all patients diagnosed with heterozygous FH. </p><p>Numerous studies have found that these individuals often receive suboptimal treatment or no treatment. In a retrospective analysis of 2382 patients referred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory with LDL-C &ge;130 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> severe FH, defined by any prior LDL-C &ge;280 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> was identified in 54 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hypercholesterolemia-in-adults-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. LDL-C reduction &ge;50 percent of the peak value was achieved in 56 percent, LDL-C &lt;130 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in 32 percent, and LDL-C &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in 17 percent of patients. Treatment with high-intensity statins plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ezetimibe-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ezetimibe</a> was prescribed for 67 percent, high-intensity statin alone in 24 percent, and other lipid-lowering therapies in 9 percent of patients. In the SAFEHEART study (Spanish Familial Hypercholesterolemia Cohort Study) that included 2732 patients with molecularly diagnosed FH, 46.8 percent were treated with maximal combination therapy (high-intensity statin plus ezetimibe), and 71.8 percent on maximal lipid-lowering therapy (treatment with an anticipated &gt;50 percent reduction in LDL-C) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hypercholesterolemia-in-adults-treatment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Among patients treated with maximum lipid-lowering therapy, an LDL-C treatment target &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> was achieved by only 11.2 percent of patients. The multivariable predictors of incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) at five years were age &ge;60 years (hazard ratio 2.92 [1.14 to 7.52 for ages 30 to 59 years], and 4.27 [1.60 to 11.48 for ages &ge;60 years versus &lt;30 years]), male sex (hazard ratio 2.01 [1.33 to 3.04]), history of ASCVD before enrollment (4.15 [2.55 to 6.75]), high blood pressure (1.99 [1.26 to 3.15]), obesity (2.67 [1.47 to 4.85]), active smoking (1.62 [1.08 to 2.44]), and LDL-C between 100 and 159 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.50 [0.60 to 10.53]) and &ge;160 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (4.80 [1.15 to 20.01]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hypercholesterolemia-in-adults-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3218063063\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We attempt to have a detailed discussion with each patient prior to initiating therapy. Similarly, it is important for the clinician and the patient to have an ongoing dialog. Prior to starting therapy, we teach the patient about the nature of the disease, including the potential for early atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events. An explanation of the benefits and risks of therapy as well as the fact that there are factual gaps in our understanding of the disease is essential. The patient should be informed that these gaps prevent us from being able to make strong recommendations regarding the end point of therapy in some situations. </p><p>For heterozygous FH patients, the following steps (sequentially) are a reasonable approach: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Set LDL-C goal. (See <a href=\"#H3683226314\" class=\"local\">'Goal of therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initiate high-dose statin therapy. (See <a href=\"#H632142877\" class=\"local\">'Initial drug therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measure LDL-C in 6 to 12 weeks. If the patient is not more than 20 to 30 percent above LDL-C goal after statin, start <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ezetimibe-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ezetimibe</a> 10 mg daily and repeat LDL-C in 6 to 12 weeks. If the patient remains above goal, consider adding a PCSK9 inhibitor. (See <a href=\"#H1547336039\" class=\"local\">'Second line therapy'</a> below.)<br/></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If after statin monotherapy the patient remains more than 20 to 30 percent above goal, consider adding a PCSK9 inhibitor before <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ezetimibe-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ezetimibe</a>. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients who do not achieve their LDL-C goal on statin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ezetimibe-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ezetimibe</a>, and PCSK9 inhibitor are candidates for third line therapy, which may be recommended by a lipid specialist. This group of patients may include individuals at very high risk of a cardiovascular disease event. (See <a href=\"#H407500340\" class=\"local\">'Third line treatment'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3683226314\"><span class=\"h2\">Goal of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most experts agree that intensive lowering of LDL-C is indicated for heterozygous FH patients. The rationale is presented above. (See <a href=\"#H392012451\" class=\"local\">'Rationale for intense LDL-C lowering'</a> above.) </p><p>We acknowledge that many patients will not be able to achieve their LDL-C goals for reasons presented below. One of the difficult tasks in the management of LDL-C for the clinician and his or her patient is the determination when the LDL-C is close enough to goal such that additional therapy will not be started.</p><p>In addition, some experts believe that there should be different goals for different risk FH patients. For example, the risk of a cardiovascular disease event is different for the following two patients with identical on-treatment LDL-C: someone without a history of cardiovascular disease and another individual with a recent myocardial infarction.</p><p>Achieving an intensive LDL-C goal may be difficult for many reasons, including the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with FH, the pretreatment LDL-C is greatly variable, ranging from 190 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> to greater than 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. If statin therapy consistently reduced LDL-C levels by 60 percent, post-statin LDL-C levels would range from 76 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> to greater than 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. In reality, there is even greater variation since LDL-C response to statin therapy at the maximally tolerated dose ranges from 20 to 60 percent. Thus, it may be unrealistic for a patient whose starting LDL-C is 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> to achieve an LDL-C of &lt;70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some therapies, such as PCSK9 inhibitors, are costly and may not be an option for some patients.</p><p/><p>While not based on randomized trial evidence, we believe the following broad approach to goal setting is reasonable:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The LDL-C goal should be individualized for each patient, given the above considerations. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Based on the starting LDL-C, we consider a high intensity statin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ezetimibe-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ezetimibe</a> as initial therapy for those high-risk patients who may benefit from &gt;60 percent reduction in LDL-C.&nbsp;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This LDL-C goal can be modified (higher or lower) based on the patient&rsquo;s risk of future cardiovascular events. For very high-risk FH individuals, such as those with diabetes, multiple other cardiovascular disease risk factors, prior acute coronary syndrome, stages 3 or 4 chronic kidney disease, or atherosclerosis in multiple cardiovascular beds, we choose a more aggressive target of 55 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. Although there is no evidence to recommend this particular number, it has practical value in that it is easy to remember and is measurably lower than 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients felt to be at very low risk, an LDL-C goal of 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> may be reasonable.</p><p/><p>Our suggestions for therapies to achieve these goals are discussed directly below.

In initial studies, FH heterozygotes were typically treated with multidrug regimens, which included less potent statins. Many studies demonstrated a reduction in cardiovascular disease events, including mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hypercholesterolemia-in-adults-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. At present, high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atorvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atorvastatin</a> (titrated to 80 mg daily) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosuvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rosuvastatin</a> (40 mg daily) should be the initial regimen since these drugs are more effective at lowering LDL-C than other statins as monotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hypercholesterolemia-in-adults-treatment/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=statins-actions-side-effects-and-administration\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Statins: Actions, side effects, and administration&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We recognize that some younger patients and vegans may achieve desirable LDL-C on moderate-intensity statins. &#160;</p><p>The benefit of this approach was evaluated in a trial in which 325 patients with FH were randomly assigned to high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atorvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atorvastatin</a> (80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> or conventional dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">simvastatin</a> (40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> for two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hypercholesterolemia-in-adults-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. High-dose atorvastatin produced a larger reduction in LDL-C (308 to 149 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [8 versus 3.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> than conventional dose simvastatin (321 to 185 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [8.3 to 4.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span>. High-dose atorvastatin also produced a significant reduction in carotid intima media thickness, measured with B-mode ultrasound, compared with an increase with simvastatin. &#160; </p><p>For patients who have not significantly (by at least 30 percent) lowered their LDL-C on either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosuvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rosuvastatin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atorvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atorvastatin</a>, we often switch the statin agent. An occasional patient will respond to the other statin with a more substantial decrease in LDL-C. We do <strong>not</strong> treat patients with two statins at the same time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1547336039\"><span class=\"h2\">Second line therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most adult heterozygotes will not be able to achieve LDL-C goal with maximally tolerated, high-dose statin monotherapy (see <a href=\"#H3683226314\" class=\"local\">'Goal of therapy'</a> above), which will likely lower LDL-C no more than 55 to 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hypercholesterolemia-in-adults-treatment/abstract/9,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,14,15</a>]. If after three months of compliant statin therapy the LDL-C target has not been reached, we add a second drug to lower LDL-C. However, experts differ on the optimal approach after statin. Most experts recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ezetimibe-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ezetimibe</a>, a PCSK9 inhibitor, or both. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pcsk9-inhibitors-pharmacology-adverse-effects-and-use#H1063920136\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;PCSK9 inhibitors: Pharmacology, adverse effects, and use&quot;, section on 'Clinical effect'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-elevated-low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-ldl-c-in-primary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of elevated low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease&quot;, section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a>.)</p><p>In our practice, when a second agent is required, we typically initiate <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ezetimibe-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ezetimibe</a> 10 mg daily as the next cholesterol lowering agent based on the results from IMPROVE-IT, and follow this with a PCSK9 inhibitor based on the results from FOURIER when the goal has not been met. Ezetimibe can lower LDL-C by an additional 20 to 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hypercholesterolemia-in-adults-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, if on statin the patient remains significantly above goal such that a 20 to 30 percent additional reduction will not bring the patient to goal, we consider adding a PCSK9 inhibitor as the next LDL-C lowering therapy. We acknowledge that many insurers will not approve a PCSK9 inhibitor without prior trial of ezetimibe.</p><p>While additional lipid lowering therapy produces a further reduction in LDL-C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hypercholesterolemia-in-adults-treatment/abstract/16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-20</a>], there have been no trials in heterozygous FH patients demonstrating improved clinical outcomes in patients already on high-dose statin therapy. However, the FOURIER trial of patients without FH found that a PCSK9 inhibitor (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=evolocumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">evolocumab</a>) lowered the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) and non-fatal stroke. There was no decrease in the risk of cardiovascular death. As patients with FH are at a higher risk of cardiovascular disease events at any LDL-C level compared with those who do not have FH, we believe that FOURIER supports the use of PCSK9 inhibitors to achieve LDL-C goals in these individuals. </p><p>While PCSK9 inhibitors are highly effective at lowering LDL-C and have been shown in patients without FH to lower the risk of MI and stroke, many patients may not have access to these drugs due to cost. Even in geographies where they have been approved for use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hypercholesterolemia-in-adults-treatment/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>], they may not be covered by insurance carriers or insurance carriers may require large monthly copayments from patients. Some cost-effectiveness studies have concluded that this class of drug is cost effective despite the absence of direct evidence of cardiovascular disease risk reduction in FH patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hypercholesterolemia-in-adults-treatment/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pcsk9-inhibitors-pharmacology-adverse-effects-and-use\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;PCSK9 inhibitors: Pharmacology, adverse effects, and use&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Evidence of benefit with surrogate (non-clinical) outcomes from PCSK9 therapy in patients with heterozygous FH comes from the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the ODYSSEY I and ODYSSEY II trials, 735 heterozygous FH patients on maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy (including statin) were randomly assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alirocumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alirocumab</a> or placebo every two weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-hypercholesterolemia-in-adults-treatment/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].
