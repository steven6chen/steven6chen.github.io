It is an aggressive NHL in which survival without treatment is measured in months. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-the-hematopoietic-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of the hematopoietic neoplasms&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The initial treatment of DLBCL is dependent on the extent of disease. The staging system used for NHL focuses on the number of tumor sites (nodal and extranodal) and their location (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97479\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97479 \">table 1</a>). For treatment purposes, patients with DLBCL are generally classified as having either limited stage disease or advanced stage disease based on whether or not the tumor can be contained within one irradiation field:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limited stage disease (usually stage I or II) &ndash; Limited stage DLBCL can be contained within one irradiation field. This population accounts for 30 to 40 percent of patients with DLBCL. Limited stage DLBCL is treated primarily with combined modality therapy consisting of abbreviated (ie, three cycles) systemic chemoimmunotherapy (eg, R-CHOP; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>) and involved-field radiation therapy (IFRT).

This population accounts for 60 to 70 percent of patients with DLBCL. Advanced stage DLBCL is treated with systemic chemoimmunotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of advanced stage diffuse large B cell lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Patients with bulky (&gt;10 cm) stage II disease and patients with stage IIB disease have a less favorable prognosis than those with non-bulky stage II disease without systemic B symptoms. Many clinicians treat such patients in a similar fashion to those with advanced stage disease. (See <a href=\"#H1565172628\" class=\"local\">'Bulky disease'</a> below.)</p><p>The initial treatment of limited stage DLBCL is discussed here; diagnosis, staging, prognostic measures, and the treatment of advanced stage DLBCL and relapsed disease are presented separately.

This population accounts for 30 to 40 percent of patients with DLBCL. Patients with bulky (&gt;10 cm) stage II disease have a prognosis similar to that of patients with stage III or IV disease and therefore need to be treated more aggressively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97479\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97479 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1565172628\" class=\"local\">'Bulky disease'</a> below.)</p><p>For most patients with non-bulky limited stage DLBCL, we suggest combined modality therapy consisting of abbreviated chemoimmunotherapy (ie, three cycles of R-CHOP; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>) and involved-field radiation therapy (IFRT). This suggestion is informed by comparable outcomes but less toxicity when compared with six to eight cycles of chemoimmunotherapy alone. Although prognosis varies according to the International Prognostic Index (IPI) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70850\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70850 \">table 2</a>), this treatment achieves five- and 10-year overall survival (OS) rates of approximately 95 and 75 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Chemoimmunotherapy alone is an acceptable alternative to combined modality therapy, especially in situations where radiation may have increased toxicity. For most patients this entails six to eight cycles of R-CHOP. However, in a select group of patients, as few as four cycles of chemoimmunotherapy can achieve excellent outcomes in patients who attain an early negative positron emission tomography (PET) scan, as described below. (See <a href=\"#H93465924\" class=\"local\">'Chemoimmunotherapy with or without radiation'</a> below.)</p><p>The administration of radiation therapy without chemoimmunotherapy is <strong>not</strong> recommended, because it is associated with a relapse rate of approximately 70 percent and inferior survival when compared with chemoimmunotherapy plus radiation. (See <a href=\"#H93465931\" class=\"local\">'Radiation alone'</a> below.)</p><p>There are some special scenarios (eg, testicular lymphoma, central nervous system involvement) where additional therapy is required (eg, intrathecal chemotherapy). These are discussed in more detail below. (See <a href=\"#H1565171719\" class=\"local\">'Unusual sites of involvement'</a> below.)</p><p>The genetic and molecular characterization of DLBCL may influence treatment. While most cases of limited stage DLBCL will have good outcomes with R-CHOP-based therapy and cell of origin characterization does not currently alter the selection of therapy, those with &quot;double hit&quot; DLBCL require special consideration. (See <a href=\"#H603806406\" class=\"local\">'Double hit DLBCL'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93465924\"><span class=\"h2\">Chemoimmunotherapy with or without radiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The preferred treatment for most patients with non-bulky limited stage DLBCL is a combined modality approach, consisting of three cycles of R-CHOP (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>) followed by locoregional radiation therapy (RT) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F63586\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63586 \">table 3</a>). </p><p>Chemoimmunotherapy alone (usually six to eight cycles of R-CHOP) is an acceptable alternative to combined modality treatment that achieves similar long-term survival rates but has different toxicities. Combined modality therapy has less acute cardiac and hematologic toxicity, and toxicities related to RT depend on the location of disease (and radiation fields). Chemoimmunotherapy alone may be preferred in situations where RT is expected to have increased long-term toxicity. Examples include older adults with involvement of the oronasopharynx (eg, to minimize severe <span class=\"nowrap\">mucositis/tooth</span> loss), younger women with mediastinal involvement (eg, to avoid irradiation of breast tissue), and patients with pelvic involvement (eg, to lessen bone marrow suppression).</p><p>R-CHOP is the preferred chemoimmunotherapy regimen for DLBCL, based on randomized trials that included only small numbers of patients with limited stage disease, but subset analyses suggest a benefit to including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> therapy for this group. As an example, the randomized MabThera International (MInT) Trial, which demonstrated an OS benefit with the addition of rituximab to CHOP-like chemotherapy, included a large number of patients with stage II or bulky stage I disease (72 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Patients with bulky disease (defined differently by each country) and extranodal disease received RT. In this trial, patients with an IPI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70850\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70850 \">table 2</a>) of zero and no bulky disease treated with chemoimmunotherapy (that included rituximab) had significantly higher three-year event-free survival (EFS; 89 versus 78 percent) and a trend toward increased OS (98 versus 92 percent) when compared with those who received chemotherapy alone. These trials are described in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of advanced stage diffuse large B cell lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Initial treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H264593724\"><span class=\"h3\">Is radiation therapy necessary?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As described above, for most patients with limited stage DLBCL we suggest abbreviated R-CHOP followed by involved-field radiation therapy (IFRT) for most patients with limited stage DLBCL. However, treatment regimens that do not include RT are an acceptable alternative, especially for patients with relative contraindications to RT, since long-term follow-up of randomized trials suggests similar OS and progression-free survival (PFS) rates. (See <a href=\"#H1554321906\" class=\"local\">'Initial treatment'</a> above.)</p><p>The only phase III trial that has examined R-CHOP versus R-CHOP plus RT for limited stage DLBCL reported similar outcomes with both treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The <span class=\"nowrap\">LYSA/GOELAMS</span> (Lymphoma Study <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/French</span> Acute Leukaemia and Blood Diseases West-East Group) trial 02-03 randomly assigned 334 adults with low tumor burden stage <span class=\"nowrap\">I/II</span> DLBCL (greatest tumor diameter &lt;7 cm) to R-CHOP-14 (cycles repeated every 14 days) with or without 40 Gy RT. Patients received either four or six cycles of R-CHOP (based on initial risk stratification), and those who achieved complete response (CR) by PET scan after four treatment cycles either received 40 Gy of radiation or were observed. Patients who achieved only partial response (PR) received two more cycles of R-CHOP-14 and 40 Gy of RT regardless of upfront randomization. The following outcomes were reported at five years for R-CHOP versus R-CHOP plus RT:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EFS: 89 and 92 percent, respectively</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>OS: 92 and 96 percent, respectively</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After RT, two patients had grade 3 mucositis and one patient had jaw osteonecrosis; hematologic and cardiac toxicity from R-CHOP was modest and comparable between the two arms</p><p/><p>Four multi-institutional randomized trials have compared CHOP plus RT versus CHOP alone for patients with limited stage aggressive lymphoma (including DLBCL) before <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> was routinely added to chemotherapy for DLBCL.

At a median follow-up of 4.4 years, combination therapy with three cycles of CHOP plus IFRT resulted in higher rates of five-year PFS (77 versus 64 percent) and OS (82 versus 72 percent). In addition, patients treated with combined modality therapy had lower rates of cardiac toxicity (0 versus 3.5 percent) and severe neutropenia (27 versus 35 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Unexpectedly, longer follow-up of this trial (median follow up &gt;17 years) revealed no significant difference in PFS (median 11 versus 12 years; hazard ratio [HR] 1.05, 95% CI 0.79-1.39) or OS (median 14 versus 13 years; HR 1.14, 95% CI 0.85-1.53) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

When RT is administered without chemoimmunotherapy in this setting, relapse outside of the radiation field is common, and this approach has inferior survival rates when compared with chemotherapy plus RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/16,17,26-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17,26-31</a>]. However, in patients who are otherwise unable to tolerate any systemic chemotherapy, involved-field radiation may be used for palliation or for cure if the disease is limited. Patients unable to tolerate systemic chemotherapy may also have difficulty tolerating RT. IFRT alone results in five-year disease-free survival rates of less than 40 percent in patients with limited stage aggressive lymphoma, such as DLBCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1554321934\"><span class=\"h2\">Our general approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Either abbreviated chemoimmunotherapy plus IFRT or extended chemoimmunotherapy without RT are acceptable treatment options for patients with non-bulky limited stage DLBCL. For most patients with non-bulky limited stage DLBCL, we suggest treatment with abbreviated chemoimmunotherapy (three cycles of R-CHOP) plus IFRT (30 to 36 Gy) rather than extended chemoimmunotherapy (six to eight cycles of R-CHOP) alone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F63586\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63586 \">table 3</a>). Higher doses of RT (eg, 45 to 50 Gy) may be needed for patients with persistent PET-positive disease after chemoimmunotherapy. In cases where radiation may cause significant morbidity (eg, involvement of the oronasopharynx or pelvis), the dose of chemoimmunotherapy is maximized to allow delivery of a more tolerable radiation dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. For example, chemoimmunotherapy alone may be indicated in young women in whom the breast would otherwise have to be irradiated and in those in whom radiation to the salivary glands might lead to loss of their teeth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

This survival rate is similar to that observed among patients with stage III or IV DLBCL. Among patients with bulky (&gt;10 cm) stage I or II DLBCL we suggest the addition of involved-field radiation therapy (IFRT; 30 to 40 Gy) after completion of six cycles of R-CHOP rather than six to eight cycles of R-CHOP alone or three cycles of R-CHOP followed by radiation therapy (RT). Despite this more aggressive approach, survival rates of patients with bulky disease remain worse than for those of patients without bulky disease.</p><p>The randomized MabThera International (MInT) Trial, which demonstrated an overall survival (OS) benefit with the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> to six cycles of CHOP-like chemotherapy, included a small number of patients with masses &gt;10 cm (3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. All patients with bulky disease received adjuvant RT. Three-year event-free survival (EFS) rates of patients with early stage disease treated with R-CHOP were higher in those with tumors &lt;5 cm when compared with those with tumors &gt;10 cm (83 versus 73 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Three-year OS rates were also higher for those with tumors &lt;5 cm when compared with those with tumors &gt;10 cm (98 versus 85 percent, respectively). Unfortunately, despite the addition of RT, the presence of bulky disease remained a poor prognostic factor. These trials are described in more detail separately.

We prefer this approach because studies in non-bulky disease suggest that combined chemoimmunotherapy plus RT may be superior to chemoimmunotherapy alone, as well as less toxic. We choose six cycles of R-CHOP rather than eight because RT does not appear to add benefit to eight cycles and because maximum response to bulky disease is usually observed by six cycles of chemoimmunotherapy; this approach limits anthracycline exposure, which is particularly relevant if the heart is in the radiation field. In addition, six cycles were used in the MInT trial, which was the only trial of R-CHOP to include patients with bulky disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1565171719\"><span class=\"h2\">Unusual sites of involvement</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H403879995\"><span class=\"h3\">Gastrointestinal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastrointestinal (GI) DLBCL is the most common site of extranodal presentation, and represents about one-third of cases of primary extranodal DLBCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

Certain patient populations have higher rates of CNS involvement both at the time of diagnosis and at relapse. There is general agreement that patients with testicular, epidural, or paranasal sinus involvement are at high risk of developing CNS disease. The evidence for an increased risk of CNS relapse is less strong for other scenarios that we still consider high risk, such as patients with breast or ovarian involvement, concordant bone marrow involvement, a high International Prognostic Index (IPI), or multiple extranodal sites of disease.

Neurosurgical intervention is usually not performed since DLBCL is sensitive to both chemoimmunotherapy and RT and unlikely to be cured by surgical resection. The timing of chemoimmunotherapy and RT is controversial. If the diagnosis of DLBCL is known, we prefer to administer emergent chemoimmunotherapy first.

Given its low morbidity and suggested benefit, for patients with DLBCL with testicular involvement, we suggest the administration of both IFRT and low dose RT to the contralateral testis. For patients with testicular lymphoma, we also recommend the administration of CNS prophylaxis in addition to systemic chemoimmunotherapy rather than chemoimmunotherapy alone.

Initial treatment usually involves bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy, although unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy may be acceptable if there is no evidence of disease on the contralateral side after careful inspection. Hysterectomy is not indicated but is often performed if taking both ovaries to prevent problems with bleeding.</p><p>Adjuvant R-CHOP chemoimmunotherapy is given according to stage.

It is an aggressive NHL in which survival without treatment is measured in months. Limited stage disease (usually Ann Arbor stage I or II) is defined as that which can traditionally be contained within one irradiation field. This population accounts for less than 30 percent of patients with DLBCL. (See <a href=\"#H1428162\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pretreatment evaluation both determines the molecular subtype and extent of the disease and provides information about the individual's comorbidities that are likely to affect treatment options. In addition to a history and physical examination, it is our practice to perform laboratory studies, unilateral bone marrow biopsy, and imaging in all patients. Certain subsets of patients will require further testing of their cerebrospinal fluid and cardiac function. Fertility counseling should be offered to patients in childbearing years. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of advanced stage diffuse large B cell lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Pretreatment evaluation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with non-bulky limited stage DLBCL, we suggest treatment with abbreviated chemoimmunotherapy plus involved-field radiation therapy (IFRT), rather than chemoimmunotherapy alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We administer three cycles of R-CHOP (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F63586\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63586 \">table 3</a>) followed by 30 to 36 Gy of IFRT. In cases where radiation therapy (RT) may cause significant morbidity (eg, involvement of the oronasopharynx or pelvis), the dose of chemoimmunotherapy is maximized to allow delivery of a more tolerable radiation dose. Chemoimmunotherapy alone may be preferable, for example, in young women in whom the breast would otherwise have to be irradiated, in those for whom radiation to the salivary glands might lead to loss of teeth, or in patients who choose to defer RT. (See <a href=\"#H1554321906\" class=\"local\">'Initial treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The general treatment principles for limited stage DLBCL apply to most disease presentations and patient populations. However, older adults and patients with cardiac disease or HIV infection require special consideration as do patients with &quot;double hit&quot; DLBCL.

(See <a href=\"#H1565172628\" class=\"local\">'Bulky disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrointestinal (GI) involvement is the most common site of extranodal DLBCL.
