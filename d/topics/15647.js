(See <a href=\"#H14004294\" class=\"local\">'Switching antidepressants'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-of-resistant-depression#H8047894\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Treatment of resistant depression&quot;, section on 'Switching antidepressants'</a>.) </p><p>The primary options for patients who respond to SSRIs but suffer sexual dysfunction include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-caused-by-selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-ssris-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Waiting for spontaneous remission of sexual impairment and decreasing the dose</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Switching to a non-SSRI antidepressant or a different SSRI</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using a second drug to offset the adverse effects</p><p/><p>Most treatment strategies and specific treatments have not been compared in head to head trials. In addition, the results of some studies are difficult to interpret because it is not clear whether sexual dysfunction began during SSRI treatment and thus represents an adverse effect, or began prior to onset of treatment with SSRIs and represents a symptom of the depressive syndrome. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87569505\"><span class=\"h1\">FIRST LINE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For depressed patients who respond well to SSRIs but suffer sexual dysfunction, we suggest initially waiting (eg, two to eight weeks) for spontaneous remission of the adverse effect, and if sexual impairment persists, decreasing the dose. Although not well studied, these interventions are frequently the first approach taken by many clinicians and authorities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-caused-by-selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-ssris-management/abstract/3,5,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,9</a>]. </p><p>For SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction, it seems that watchful waiting alone is typically not effective. A prospective observational study (n = 156 patients) found that after waiting four to six months, moderate to complete improvement occurred in only 19 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-caused-by-selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-ssris-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Waiting for patients to adapt to the SSRI may work best for patients with mild sexual dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-caused-by-selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-ssris-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Decreasing the dose for patients with SSRI-induced sexual impairment often appears to be helpful. In a prospective observational study (n = 30 patients) in which the dose was decreased by 50 percent, at least moderate improvement occurred in 77 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-caused-by-selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-ssris-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Reducing the dose may be most feasible for remitted patients who have remained stable for at least several weeks, and for patients taking high doses or suffering other adverse effects.</p><p>However, decreasing the dose may diminish therapeutic effects; thus, the dose should be decreased in small increments and should not be reduced beyond the minimum therapeutic dose. In addition, patients should be monitored. As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sertraline</a> 200 mg per day can be reduced by 25 to 50 mg per day every one to two weeks, with patients interviewed prior to each decrease. The minimum therapeutic dose for sertraline is typically 50 mg per day (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53818\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53818 \">table 1</a>).

Treatment options for these patients include switching to a different antidepressant, or augmenting the SSRI with a second drug. The choice depends upon the degree of relief from the depressive syndrome and the degree of sexual impairment:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who obtain only modest relief from depressive symptoms with the SSRI, we suggest switching to a different antidepressant. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who obtain substantial relief from the depressive syndrome, but suffer severe sexual dysfunction, we suggest switching antidepressants.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who obtain substantial relief from the depressive syndrome and whose sexual dysfunction is only moderate, we suggest augmenting the SSRI with a second drug. For males with erectile dysfunction, we recommend adjunctive treatment with a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor. For women with sexual dysfunction, we typically suggest add-on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a> at higher doses. However, if female sexual dysfunction is limited to delayed orgasm or anorgasmia, a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor is a reasonable option. In addition, a reasonable alternative for both men and women is to switch antidepressants.</p><p/><p>Switching antidepressants is often preferable to augmentation because adherence may be better with monotherapy than combination treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-caused-by-selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-ssris-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In addition, monotherapy may cause fewer adverse effects, cost less, and present fewer risks of drug interactions in patients taking medications for other conditions. Conversely, augmentation with a second drug maintains the benefit derived from the SSRI, whereas switching antidepressants may lead to relapse of depression or new adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-caused-by-selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-ssris-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

For men with erectile dysfunction, we recommend adjunctive treatment with a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, rather than bupropion (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).
