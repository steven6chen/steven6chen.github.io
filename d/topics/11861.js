id=\"H982796403\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NIV describes the delivery of mechanical respiratory support without the need for endotracheal intubation through an interface (eg, nasal prongs or mask, face mask, or helmet) that delivers continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway support (BPAP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-for-acute-and-impending-respiratory-failure-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. NIV offers the ability to reduce patient work of breathing and improve respiratory gas exchange while avoiding the risks and complications related to the placement of an endotracheal tube, administration of sedation and neuromuscular blockade, and delivery of invasive mechanical ventilation. NIV can be initiated during critical care transport, in the emergency department, in an intensive care unit (ICU), and in some &quot;stepdown&quot; (eg, intermediate or progressive care) units.</p><p>The delivery of heated and humidified high-flow oxygen by nasal cannula has similar physiologic benefits compared to NIV. However, it is considered a different modality, and its use in children is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=continuous-oxygen-delivery-systems-for-infants-children-and-adults#H2427430\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Continuous oxygen delivery systems for infants, children, and adults&quot;, section on 'High flow'</a>.)</p><p>Bubble CPAP has been studied in preterm infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-for-acute-and-impending-respiratory-failure-in-children/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. There is limited data available regarding use in children beyond the neonatal period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-for-acute-and-impending-respiratory-failure-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Further study is needed before bubble CPAP can be recommended in children, and therefore, it is not discussed in this topic.</p><p>In general, acute respiratory failure is defined as an infant or child who presents in acute respiratory distress with either acute hypoxia requiring supplemental FiO<sub>2</sub> to maintain a SpO<sub>2</sub> &ge;92 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> acute hypercarbia with a PaCO<sub>2</sub> &gt;50 mmHg (with an arterial pH usually &lt;7.35). In practice, clinicians often intervene based upon oxygen saturation and degree of respiratory distress (eg, severe tachypnea, retractions), without obtaining blood gases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H706629434\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NIV offers three primary physiologic benefits as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-for-acute-and-impending-respiratory-failure-in-children/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreasing the patient's work of breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintaining patency throughout the respiratory tract, from the upper airways to the smaller lower airways, which can facilitate expiratory flow and reduce obstructive apnea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recruiting alveoli, resulting in increased functional residual capacity (FRC) and decreased ventilation-perfusion (V-Q) mismatch</p><p/><p>In addition, the absence of an endotracheal tube results in reduced complications related to invasive airway management including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-for-acute-and-impending-respiratory-failure-in-children/abstract/6,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laryngeal or tracheal injury potentially resulting from the intubation procedure or longstanding mucosal pressure from an endotracheal <span class=\"nowrap\">tube/cuff</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interruption of the natural airway clearance mechanisms, potentially resulting in ventilator-associated pneumonia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potential adverse effects or complications related to sedation with or without neuromuscular blockade</p><p/><p>Unfortunately, use of NIV is not without risk. Most importantly, it may delay endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation for patients who require this therapy. It may also provide insufficient positive end-expiratory pressure if there is a large air leak. (See <a href=\"#H706629559\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H706629440\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANICS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H706629447\"><span class=\"h2\">Interface</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of patient-ventilator interfaces are available for use during NIV in the pediatric population including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nasal cannula (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F101261\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101261 \">picture 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nasal mask (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F101262\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101262 \">picture 2</a>) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Full-face mask (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F101263\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101263 \">picture 3</a>) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Helmet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F101264\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101264 \">picture 4</a>) </p><p/><p>A full-face mask or helmet more reliably provides continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) but may cause agitation, especially in infants and younger children. A nasal cannula or nasal mask is often better tolerated but pressure leak due to a poor interface seal or through the mouth may limit effectiveness. (See <a href=\"#H706629504\" class=\"local\">'Choosing an interface'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H706629453\"><span class=\"h2\">Modes of ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NIV refers to two types of ventilator support as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-for-acute-and-impending-respiratory-failure-in-children/abstract/1,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)</strong> &ndash; CPAP provides a constant, programmed level of distending airway pressure throughout the entire respiratory cycle. Physiologically, it is the equivalent of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=positive-end-expiratory-pressure-peep#H1\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)&quot;, section on 'Definition'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV)</strong> &ndash; NIPPV provides an assisted ventilator pressure, either synchronized with each spontaneous respiratory effort (spontaneous) or at a defined backup rate (timed).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Bilevel positive airway support (BPAP), as the name implies, delivers two set levels of positive airway pressure, one during inspiration (IPAP) and one during expiration (EPAP). When the ventilator detects inspiratory flow, it delivers a higher inspiratory pressure until sensing a reduction in flow or when reaching a set inspiratory time limit. When inspiration terminates (based on flow or time), the device cycles to a lower expiratory pressure. BiPAP and BIPAP are terms related to the delivery of BPAP using proprietary ventilators. These are just two of several ventilators that can deliver BPAP.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">NIPPV can also be used to deliver other modes of ventilation, such as assist control, pressure support, and proportional assist ventilation. However, these ventilation modes are used less frequently in children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive ventilation in acute respiratory failure in adults&quot;, section on 'Mode'</a>.)</p><p/><p>With NIV, supplemental oxygen can be delivered via the ventilator tubing, mask, or oxygen blenders.

Published studies in infants and younger children favor this approach as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-for-acute-and-impending-respiratory-failure-in-children/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. However, it can be difficult to achieve sufficient ventilator support using nasal delivery in some children secondary to poor seal, or as a result of air leak through an open mouth.</p><p>We commonly use face masks as the initial interface in school-age children and adolescents with less severe disease. They should be prepared for what to expect and coached through the NIV initiation process. We also use a full face mask as the initial interface for any infant or child with more severe hypoxia or hypercarbia to ensure adequate seal and delivery of PEEP, recognizing that cooperation may be less likely. Sedation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexmedetomidine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dexmedetomidine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">midazolam</a> may facilitate initiation of NIV in anxious or agitated patients. (See <a href=\"#H706629534\" class=\"local\">'Sedation'</a> below.)</p><p>In infants and children who are too agitated to tolerate NIV or in whom mask seal is not achievable, invasive ventilation should not be delayed if the patient needs additional support.</p><p>Use of helmets as the initial interface of choice in infants and young children has been described in small case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-for-acute-and-impending-respiratory-failure-in-children/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>], but they are not as widely available as other pediatric NIV interfaces.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1926882628\"><span class=\"h3\">Interface sizing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nasal and full face masks are typically available in three sizes: infant and small child, youth, and standard (adult). Specific sizes may vary by manufacturer. The clinician should choose the mask that covers the nose, or nose and mouth without contacting the eyes. The smallest mask that properly fits should also be used to limit dead space (volume of inhaled gas not reaching the alveoli for gas exchange).

CPAP is also commonly utilized as a therapy for obstructive sleep apnea. (See <a href=\"#H706629453\" class=\"local\">'Modes of ventilation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cpap-for-pediatric-obstructive-sleep-apnea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;CPAP for pediatric obstructive sleep apnea&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Examples of patients who we typically start on CPAP include infants with bronchiolitis and intermittent apnea who benefit from the stimulation provided by NIV, or those with increased work of breathing who appear at risk of tiring. Children with reversible obstructive processes, such as status asthmaticus or croup may benefit, if response to medical therapies is ineffective. Patients with pneumonia may also benefit from CPAP if the patient&rsquo;s primary problem is hypoxemia and not hypercarbia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bilevel PAP (BPAP)</strong> &ndash; BPAP is often selected for patients in need of a greater level of respiratory support, including those who do not show timely improvement with CPAP. With higher mean airway pressures, bilevel support is likely to better address hypoxemia. In addition, the increased support during inspiration can further offload work of breathing, increase tidal volume ventilation, and more rapidly assist with managing hypercapnia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Examples of patients who we typically start on BPAP include patients with lower airway disease, such as pneumonia or cystic fibrosis, with increased work of breathing and resultant hypercarbia. We also integrate BPAP into our approach to the management of patients with status asthmaticus who have not responded to standard medical therapy, or those in whom hypercarbia is the most significant derangement. For patients who have been successfully treated with BPAP previously, either during acute illness or intermittently at home, we will generally initiate BPAP early in their course of respiratory compromise.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H706629528\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial settings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of approaches to initial NIV settings have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-for-acute-and-impending-respiratory-failure-in-children/abstract/7,12,14,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,12,14,23,24</a>].

However, anxiety or agitation can lead to patient-ventilator asynchrony, which limits effectiveness, increases the risk for barotrauma, and may necessitate pharmacologic anxiolysis or sedation. Prior to sedation, the clinician should ensure that hypoxia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypercarbia are <strong>not</strong> the cause of agitation.</p><p>The ideal sedative agent for patients undergoing NIV should provide anxiolysis without adverse impact on respiratory drive, airway protection and hemodynamic stability.

Underlying diagnosis, severity of disease, and inadequate response within one to two hours after initiation have been identified as independent predictors of NIV failure as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Underlying diagnosis</strong> &ndash; In two observational pediatric studies, one prospective and one retrospective, the diagnoses of pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-for-acute-and-impending-respiratory-failure-in-children/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>] and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-for-acute-and-impending-respiratory-failure-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] were identified as risk factors for NIV failure. Only 22 percent of ARDS patients treated with NIV avoided endotracheal intubation. Although a trial of NIV may be acceptable for select patients with ARDS, use of NIV in these high-risk patients requires frequent reassessments and simultaneous preparation for intubation if NIV were to provide insufficient support. In addition, children with primary respiratory illness may be more likely to avoid intubation than those with sepsis, malignancy, or immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-for-acute-and-impending-respiratory-failure-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Markers of illness severity</strong> &ndash; Patients with high severity of overall illness as measured by Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-for-acute-and-impending-respiratory-failure-in-children/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>] and Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction (PLOD) scoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-for-acute-and-impending-respiratory-failure-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] were noted to be more likely to fail NIV.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Response to treatment</strong> &ndash; Finally, an inadequate response to NIV, as evidenced by a lack of significant decrease in respiratory rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-for-acute-and-impending-respiratory-failure-in-children/abstract/24,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,35</a>]; persistently elevated fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) requirement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-for-acute-and-impending-respiratory-failure-in-children/abstract/20,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,36</a>]; or pH &lt;7.25 on blood gas analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-for-acute-and-impending-respiratory-failure-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>] have also been identified as variables associated with failure of NIV. Generally, significant improvement should be seen within one to two hours of initiation of NIV. A patient who is worsening despite escalation of NIV most likely requires urgent intubation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1233606149\"><span class=\"h1\">BENEFITS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Observational studies and two small trials indicate that invasive mechanical ventilation may be avoided in 60 to 100 percent of patients receiving NIV with most studies reporting a success rate of 75 to 95 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-for-acute-and-impending-respiratory-failure-in-children/abstract/12,13,18,23,24,29,31,36-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13,18,23,24,29,31,36-40</a>]. In addition, one retrospective observational study found that the use of NIV was associated with a shortened length of intensive care unit stay among infants with severe bronchiolitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-for-acute-and-impending-respiratory-failure-in-children/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>However, the heterogeneity of these study populations based upon age, underlying diagnoses, and illness severity as well as the absence of control groups in most studies makes generalization of these findings difficult. Nevertheless, this evidence suggests that NIV permits the management of acute respiratory compromise in infants and children while avoiding endotracheal intubation in a large proportion of selected patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H706629559\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence from observational studies and our experience suggest that NIV is safe for use in pediatrics when used in carefully selected patients with continuous monitoring by attentive clinicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-for-acute-and-impending-respiratory-failure-in-children/abstract/1,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,8</a>].</p><p>Potential complications include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Major </strong>&ndash; Although major complications are uncommon during NIV, they can be severe including:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Barotrauma</strong> &ndash; As with any positive pressure ventilation strategy, there is a risk of barotrauma or air leak syndrome in patients receiving NIV. Tension pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, or massive subcutaneous emphysema have all occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-for-acute-and-impending-respiratory-failure-in-children/abstract/12,18,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,18,41,42</a>]. Based upon small observational studies, rates of barotrauma range from 1.4 to 9.0 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-for-acute-and-impending-respiratory-failure-in-children/abstract/12,18,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,18,42</a>]. Thus, patients receiving NIV warrant close monitoring for signs of barotrauma and should have settings adjusted as low as possible to achieve physiologic improvement with the least amount of positive airway pressure. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Aspiration</strong> &ndash; Aspiration is a concern when using NIV. This risk also exists in any child who vomits while wearing a full-face mask. Risk of vomiting increases in patients on higher ventilatory settings. For children with gastrostomy tubes, venting the tubes can be helpful without interfering with the lower esophageal sphincter. Furthermore, treatment of nausea with antiemetics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ondansetron-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ondansetron</a>) may be warranted in selected patients. No cases of aspiration have been reported in published studies, likely reflecting the infrequency of this complication as well as careful adherence to exclusion criteria in NIV protocols, especially the avoidance of NIV in patients with impaired airway protective reflexes, difficulty clearing their secretions, or acutely altered mental status. (See <a href=\"#H706629485\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Prophylactic attempts to decompress the stomach using an oro- or naso-gastric tube may also increase the risk of vomiting and should be avoided in most patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Hemodynamic instability</strong> &ndash; Hemodynamic instability is a potential concern with decreasing venous return following initiation of any form of positive pressure ventilation. Depressed cardiac output has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-for-acute-and-impending-respiratory-failure-in-children/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]; however, careful selection of suitable candidates for NIV, specifically, avoiding NIV in patients with shock that does not rapidly respond to fluid administration, can mitigate this risk. (See <a href=\"#H706629485\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Minor</strong> &ndash; Minor complications generally do not interfere with the efficacy of NIV and are easily addressed, if they arise as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Skin break down</strong> &ndash; Facial skin irritation, breakdown, and ulceration are the most commonly reported complications when using nasal or oronasal masks as the patient ventilator interface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-for-acute-and-impending-respiratory-failure-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Skin breakdown over the nasal bridge was reported in approximately 12 percent of patients in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-for-acute-and-impending-respiratory-failure-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Measures to avoid this complication consist of proper mask selection, skin protection, and rotation of interface for patients undergoing prolonged NIV. (See <a href=\"#H1926882628\" class=\"local\">'Interface sizing'</a> above and <a href=\"#H706629510\" class=\"local\">'Skin protection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Nasal mucosal trauma</strong> &ndash; Nasal mucosal trauma has also been noted with the use of nasal masks or nasal prongs. Resultant mucus hypersecretion can obstruct nasal prongs. Alternatively, absence of humidification can lead to dry nasal mucosa or epistaxis. Thus, patency of nasal prongs should be monitored during NIV, and patients receiving NIV via nasal masks or prongs should always have humidified and warmed gas delivery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Gastric distension</strong> &ndash; Gastric insufflation and distension can occur when inspiratory pressures exceed lower esophageal sphincter pressure (normally 10 mmHg) or when the patient swallows air (eg, during crying). Gastric distension may promote vomiting which can increase the risk for aspiration in patients receiving NIV by face mask. Keeping patients calm, with appropriate sedation as needed, and adjusting settings as low as possible to achieve physiologic improvement with the least amount of positive airway pressure helps to prevent gastric distention. For a child with a gastrostomy tube, venting the tube can be helpful without interfering with closure of the lower esophageal sphincter. However, placement of a naso- or orogastric tube may also cause vomiting and should be avoided. We avoid prophylactic attempts to decompress the stomach in patients on NIV using an oro- or naso-gastric tube as this may increase the risk of vomiting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Eye irritation or injury</strong> &ndash; Ocular trauma, primarily corneal abrasion or ulceration, can occur if the edge of the mask is in contact with the eye surface. In addition, eye irritation or conjunctivitis can occur if a poorly fitting mask permits air leak at the nasal bridge across the eyes. Both of these complications can be avoided by the use of a properly fitted mask. (See <a href=\"#H1926882628\" class=\"local\">'Interface sizing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H706629579\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) describes the delivery of mechanical respiratory support without the need for endotracheal intubation through an interface (eg, nasal prongs or mask, face mask, or helmet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F101261\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101261 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F101262\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101262 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F101263\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101263 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F101264\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101264 \">picture 4</a>)) that delivers continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway support (BPAP).

Careful patient selection, the patient's ability to tolerate the selected interface, and frequent monitoring by key members of the care team, such as nurses and respiratory therapists are essential to the successful use of NIV. For clinicians with limited experience with NIV in children, consultation with a pediatric critical care, pediatric pulmonologist, or pediatric emergency medicine specialist or other provider with expertise to determine the best method of respiratory support and to guide initiation of NIV, as needed, is encouraged. (See <a href=\"#H706629459\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H426256939\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1233606149\" class=\"local\">'Benefits'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NIV should <strong>not</strong> be used in patients with cardiopulmonary arrest, acutely impaired mental status, difficulty handling secretions, or need for airway protection (eg, epiglottitis and upper airway edema or burns) and is typically avoided in patients with hemodynamic instability requiring high levels of vasopressor support, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, untreated pneumothorax, and facial anomalies or significant facial injuries. (See <a href=\"#H706629485\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The approach to initiation of NIV in children including selection and securing of the interface (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F101330\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101330 \">picture 8</a>), selecting the mode of ventilation, and initial settings are provided. (See <a href=\"#H706629497\" class=\"local\">'Initiation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proper interface sizing, skin protection measures, and use of warmed and humidified gas delivery help avoid the complications of skin breakdown, nasal mucosal trauma, and eye irritation. (See <a href=\"#H1926882628\" class=\"local\">'Interface sizing'</a> above and <a href=\"#H706629510\" class=\"local\">'Skin protection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H706629559\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potential major complications of NIV include barotrauma including air leak syndrome, aspiration, and hemodynamic instability. Keeping patients calm, with appropriate sedation as needed, and adjusting settings as low as possible to achieve physiologic improvement with the least amount of positive airway pressure helps to lower the risk of these adverse events. (See <a href=\"#H706629528\" class=\"local\">'Initial settings'</a> above and <a href=\"#H706629534\" class=\"local\">'Sedation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H706629559\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Close monitoring is needed in all patients receiving NIV with frequent titration to optimize support. Clinical response should occur within the first one to two hours after initiation. Failure to see improvement in respiratory rate, heart rate, work of breathing, pulse oximetry, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> blood gas indices should prompt escalation in the current level of support or a change in the ventilator support strategy (eg, progression from continuous positive airway pressure to bilevel positive airway pressure or endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation). (See <a href=\"#H706629540\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of effectiveness'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-for-acute-and-impending-respiratory-failure-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Najaf-Zadeh A, Leclerc F.
