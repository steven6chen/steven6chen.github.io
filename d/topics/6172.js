Although the incidence of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is decreasing in the United States, the incidence of adenocarcinoma arising out of Barrett's esophagus is rising dramatically, although less so in the last few years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. When stratified according to anatomic location, most of the increased incidence involves tumors at the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) and gastric cardia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F103615\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103615 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The epidemiology, etiologic factors, and pathobiology of adenocarcinoma and SCC of the esophagus will be reviewed here. Small cell carcinoma and sarcomas arising in the esophagus and EGJ as well as the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of esophageal cancer are discussed separately.

Worldwide, an estimated 455,800 new esophageal cancer cases and 400,200 deaths occurred in 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Incidence rates vary internationally by nearly 16-fold, with the highest rates found in Southern and Eastern Africa and Eastern Asia, and the lowest rates in Western and Middle Africa and Central America in both males and females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In the highest-risk area, stretching from Northern Iran through the central Asian republics to North-Central China (often referred to as the &quot;esophageal cancer belt&quot;), 90 percent of cases are squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Major risk factors in these areas are not well understood, but are thought to include poor nutritional status, low intake of fruits and vegetables, and drinking beverages at high temperatures. In contrast, in low-risk areas such as the United States and several Western countries, smoking and excessive alcohol consumption account for approximately 90 percent of the total cases of esophageal SCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Country-specific rates of incidence and mortality are available in the World Health Organization <a href=\"http://globocan.iarc.fr/Pages/Map.aspx&amp;token=0fC2KlWP2lBbCApZ6DyKw47MnQXaSNBIvsugca7gMSw+6djwprsRosUIl828CRp5&amp;TOPIC_ID=2274\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">GLOBOCAN database</a>. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Smoking and alcohol'</a> below.)</p><p>Temporal trends in incidence vary for the two major histologic types of esophageal cancer. Incidence rates for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus have been increasing dramatically in several Western countries, in part due to increases in known risk factors such as overweight and obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. When stratified according to anatomic location, most of the increased incidence involves tumors at the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) and gastric cardia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F103615\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103615 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>In contrast, rates for SCC have been steadily decreasing in these same countries because of long-term reductions in tobacco use and alcohol consumption. However, SCC of the esophagus has been increasing in certain Asian countries such as Taiwan, probably as a result of increases in tobacco and alcohol consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2100395\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGIC FACTORS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Hereditary factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Familial aggregation of esophageal cancer has been described in regions with a high incidence of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), such as China [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Familial aggregation of Barrett's esophagus has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. Whether this represents common environmental risk factors or inherited predisposition is unknown. Discordant data regarding familial clustering have been published in reports from other regions including Sweden and the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. Thus, the extent to which hereditary factors are involved in the pathogenesis of esophageal cancer remains uncertain.</p><p>However, an increased risk of esophageal cancer is reported in the following hereditary conditions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is an autosomal-dominant syndrome characterized by multiple hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract, mucocutaneous pigmentation, and an increased risk of gastrointestinal (including esophagus) and non-gastrointestinal cancer.

The highest rates are found in Northern Iran, Central Asia, and North-Central China (the so-called &quot;esophageal cancer belt&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/5,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,21,22</a>]. Geographic variation has also been reported within individual countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Within China, for example, rates of esophageal cancer range from 1.4 to 140 per 100,000 in the Hebi and Hunyuan counties, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Several studies have described risk factors associated with esophageal SCC, which will be described below. Their relative importance (from a public health perspective) was estimated in a study that determined the population attributable risk for several of the major risk factors that have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The authors estimated that a history of smoking, alcohol consumption, and diets low in fruits and vegetables accounted for almost 90 percent of esophageal SCC in the United States. The relative importance of specific risk factors may be substantially different in other parts of the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. As noted above, the major risk factors for SCC in the &quot;esophageal cancer belt&quot; of Iran and Asia are not well understood, but are thought to include poor nutritional status, low intake of fruits and vegetables, and drinking beverages at high temperatures. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Dietary factors'</a> below.)</p><p>Infection with human papillomavirus may also contribute. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Human papillomavirus'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Demographic and socioeconomic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Worldwide differences in the rates of SCC have provided insight into risk factors associated with the disease. The importance of specific risk factors varies within different geographic regions. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In high incidence regions, the disease has no gender specificity. In contrast, SCC is more common in men in low incidence regions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence is higher in urban areas (compared with rural areas) of the United States, particularly among African-American men. In one report, the incidence among African-American men in Washington D.C. was 28.6 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. This compares to an overall incidence of approximately 3 to 4 per 100,000 in other parts of the United States.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower socioeconomic status was associated with esophageal SCC in a large population-based study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Smoking and alcohol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, Western Europe and some other regions of the world, cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption are major risk factors for esophageal SCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-31</a>]. Cigarette smoking is also a major risk factor in Asia, as smoking is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p> An increase in risk of esophageal SCC has been associated with cigar and pipe smoking, although the magnitude of risk appears to be less than with cigarettes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Tobacco and alcohol synergistically increase risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Smoking and alcohol are also risk factors for other aerodigestive cancers (head and neck and lung), as a result of field cancerization. Head and neck cancers are found in approximately 10 to 15 percent of patients diagnosed with esophageal cancer. In addition, patients with one aerodigestive malignancy have an increased risk of synchronous and second primary tumors of the aerodigestive tract compared with the age-matched general population. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and risk factors for head and neck cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=second-primary-malignancies-in-patients-with-head-and-neck-cancers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Second primary malignancies in patients with head and neck cancers&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The type and quantity of alcoholic beverages consumed may affect the risk of esophageal SCC. Hard liquor may have a higher risk than wine or beer; however, the cumulative amount of alcohol rather than the type is probably more important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. Individual susceptibility to alcohol may also be involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>]. In one report, for example, variations in the alcohol dehydrogenase genes were protective against aerodigestive cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Excessive alcohol consumption is an established, potentially modifiable risk factor for several other malignancies in addition to esophageal cancer, and it also complicates treatment and treatment outcomes by contributing to longer hospitalizations, prolonged recovery, higher health care costs, and greater overall and cancer-related mortality. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has issued a statement on the association of alcohol consumption with multiple cancers that outlines proposals for promoting awareness of the association between alcohol abuse and certain types of cancer; supporting policy efforts to reduce the risk of cancer through evidence-based strategies that prevent excessive use of alcohol; and providing education to oncology providers about the influence of excessive alcohol use on cancer risk and treatment complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Dietary factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several dietary associations with esophageal SCC have been uncovered in Asia. Foods containing N-nitroso compounds have long been implicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. These compounds are carcinogens that may exert their mutagenic potential by inducing alkyl adducts in DNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Certain types of pickled vegetables and other food-products consumed in high-risk endemic areas are rich in N-nitroso compounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. Toxin-producing fungi (eg, aflatoxin) have also been identified in food sources within endemic areas and may, in part, exert their mutagenic potential by reducing nitrates to nitroso compounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Chewing of areca nuts or betel quid (areca nuts wrapped in betel leaves), which is widespread in certain regions of Asia, has been implicated in the development of esophageal SCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. The mechanism may involve the release of copper, with resulting induction of collagen synthesis by fibroblasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>High temperature beverages and foods may increase the risk of esophageal cancer by causing thermal injury to the esophageal mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-53</a>]. In a systematic review of 59 studies, more than 50 percent of the studies found that higher temperatures of fluid intake were associated with a statistically significant increase in the risk of esophageal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. For coffee and tea, there was little evidence for an association between the amount of use (unrelated to temperature) and esophageal cancer risk. Few studies reported the results for SCC and adenocarcinoma separately. Chemical substances within the beverage likely confound this risk association.</p><p>An association with drinking hot tea was noted in a case-control study from northern Iran in which drinking hot tea (60 to 64&deg;C) or very hot tea (&ge;65&deg;C), and drinking tea within three minutes of its being poured was significantly associated with an increased risk of esophageal SCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. In a later study of a population-based cohort from China, the excess risk of esophageal cancer associated with consumption of hot tea was highest in those who smoked and consumed excess alcohol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>Several other dietary factors affect the risk of esophageal cancer; most of these studies come from regions with a high frequency of SCC. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A positive association between red meat intake and risk of esophageal SCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selenium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">selenium</a> levels increase risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>], while selenium supplementation has been associated with reduced risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/59-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-63</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Zinc deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>], which may act by enhancing the carcinogenic effects of nitrosamines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/65-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">65-67</a>] and by overexpression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An association between low intake of dietary folate and an increased risk of esophageal cancer has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis of observational studies suggested a significant association between higher intake of fruits and vegetables and a reduced risk of esophageal SCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Underlying esophageal disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of specific preexisting esophageal diseases (such as achalasia and caustic strictures) increases the risk of esophageal SCC as illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a population-based study including 1062 patients with achalasia, the risk of esophageal SCC was increased more than 16-fold during the first 1 to 24 years following diagnosis.

This may represent the co-existence of common risk factors for disorders predisposing to esophageal SCC and the need for partial gastrectomy such as smoking or alcohol. However, another report found that the risk of esophageal SCC and adenocarcinoma was not affected by prior gastric surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5257549\"><span class=\"h3\">Atrophic gastritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atrophic gastritis and other conditions that cause gastric atrophy are associated with an approximately twofold increased risk of esophageal SCC (but not adenocarcinoma) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].

Human papillomavirus (HPV, particularly serotypes 16 and 18) has received the most scrutiny. More than 100 studies have investigated the relationship between HPV and esophageal SCC. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations#H746850\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human papillomavirus infections: Epidemiology and disease associations&quot;, section on 'Disease associations'</a>.) </p><p>Several meta-analyses have addressed the association between HPV and esophageal SCC. Two of the most recent are described below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A systematic review and meta-analysis of 66 case-control studies concluded that there was a significant association between HPV infection and esophageal SCC (summary odds ratio 3.32, 95% CI 2.26-4.87) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. However, HPV prevalence in esophageal SCC was only 22.4 percent and that of HPV-16, the most frequently observed subtype, was only 11.4 percent. In addition, significant heterogeneity was observed between the included studies, which might be explained, at least in part, by differences in study populations and variability in HPV DNA detection methods.

For the past three decades, however, the frequency of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, esophagogastric junction (EGJ) and gastric cardia has increased dramatically, a finding initially observed in Western countries and more recently in some Eastern countries as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/104-110\" class=\"abstract_t\">104-110</a>].

As an example, a study of a cancer registry in the United States estimated that the age-adjusted incidence rates of esophageal adenocarcinoma rose progressively from 1.8 per 100,000 in 1987 to 1991 to 2.5 per 100,000 during 1992 to 1996 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>].

A significant increase in the incidence was observed among persons aged 45 to 65.</p><p>A later registry study found that in 2009, the incidence among white men was 4.87 per 100,000 and among white women it was 0.68 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>].

Whites were affected twice as often as blacks, and men five times as often as women. Most patients were older than 60 with no increase among younger cohorts.</p><p>Estimates of the incidence of these tumors from registries may be limited by problems related to how the tumors were classified. This was illustrated for gastric cardia adenocarcinoma in a study in which its incidence was estimated from a cancer registry in Sweden, and the results were compared with a gold-standard population in which classification was based upon detailed review of patient records [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>]. It was estimated that the true gastric cardia incidence could be up to 45 percent higher or 15 percent lower than estimates provided by analysis of the cancer registry. The degree to which this observation accounts for the changing epidemiology of gastric cardia adenocarcinoma requires further clarification. A large database study in the United States concluded that rising incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma represented a real increase in disease burden and not a reclassification of SCC or adjacent gastric carcinoma or an overdiagnosis of esophageal adenocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>].</p><p>Several studies have described risk factors associated with esophageal adenocarcinoma, which will be described below.
