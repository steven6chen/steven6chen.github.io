Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is one of the more common hepatobiliary complications of IBD, particularly in patients with ulcerative colitis. It is estimated that approximately 5 percent of patients with ulcerative colitis develop PSC and that ulcerative colitis is present in up to 90 percent of patients with PSC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatobiliary-manifestations-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

As a result, persistently abnormal liver biochemical tests should generally be evaluated. This topic review will focus upon the other hepatobiliary manifestations that can occur in patients with IBD. The association of IBD with PSC is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary sclerosing cholangitis: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'PSC and inflammatory bowel disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DRUG-INDUCED HEPATOTOXICITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most of the drugs used in the medical management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have been associated with liver toxicity, although the overall incidence of serious complications is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatobiliary-manifestations-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. The following are among the reactions that can be seen:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sulfasalazine</a> can cause both hepatocellular and cholestatic enzyme abnormalities, often related to a hypersensitivity reaction. Newer sulfa-free aminosalicylate preparations deliver increased amounts of the pharmacologically active ingredient of sulfasalazine (5-aminosalicylic acid [5-ASA], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mesalamine-mesalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mesalamine</a>) to the site of active bowel disease and are associated with a lower systemic toxicity. 5-ASA can rarely cause pancreatitis.

Thus, patients treated with azathioprine or 6-MP should have their liver biochemistries monitored regularly. Liver abnormalities usually resolve after discontinuation of therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunomodulator-therapy-in-crohn-disease#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunomodulator therapy in Crohn disease&quot;, section on 'Toxicity'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A metabolite of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, 6-thioguanine (6-TG), has been evaluated as an alternative immunosuppressant in inflammatory bowel disease. Unfortunately, in one study, elevated liver enzymes were noted in 26 percent of patients on 6-TG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatobiliary-manifestations-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Idiopathic noncirrhotic portal hypertension (including nodular regenerative hyperplasia) was found in 76 percent of liver biopsies of patients with liver enzyme abnormalities. In another study, treatment resulted in higher hepatic venous pressure gradients, causing clinically significant portal hypertension in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatobiliary-manifestations-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Because of these findings the authors recommended that this agent should not be used as therapy for patients with IBD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noncirrhotic-portal-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noncirrhotic portal hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methotrexate</a> has been associated with macrovesicular steatosis, hepatic fibrosis, and cirrhosis in a cumulative dose response fashion. Routine liver biopsy has been advocated as a baseline and then after a cumulative dose of 1.5 to 2.0 g. However, this recommendation has been challenged in light of the very low incidence of liver disease in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who, despite long-term use of methotrexate, are managed according to guidelines issued by the American College of Rheumatology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatobiliary-manifestations-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Noninvasive assessment of the liver for hepatic fibrosis (eg, transient elastography) may become a useful tool to monitor IBD patients treated with methotrexate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatobiliary-manifestations-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Alcohol is a risk factor for methotrexate-induced liver disease and patients should be counseled about strict avoidance of alcohol.

The increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was usually less than twice the upper limit of normal and there is usually no clinical sequelae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatobiliary-manifestations-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-in-crohn-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infliximab in Crohn disease&quot;</a>.). However, there have been case reports of severe cholestatic liver disease related to infliximab. Two patients recovered upon cessation of infliximab while one patient required liver transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatobiliary-manifestations-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-an-overview-of-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors: An overview of adverse effects&quot;</a>.) Similarly, with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a>, mild elevations in liver enzymes have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatobiliary-manifestations-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In general, patients were asymptomatic; however, there are case reports of adalimumab-induced subacute liver failure and autoimmune hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatobiliary-manifestations-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">STEATOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Steatosis, or fatty liver disease, is seen in up to 50 percent of abnormal liver biopsies in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Patients often present with hepatomegaly. The etiology is probably multifactorial, with malnutrition and corticosteroids being of primary importance. Steatosis is often related to disease severity and may be reversed with treatment of the underlying IBD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-induced-liver-injury#H156226461\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug-induced liver injury&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOLELITHIASIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gallstones are seen in 13 to 34 percent of patients with ileitis or ileal resection.

They are probably caused by the malabsorption of bile acids, which interferes with their enterohepatic circulation. This leads to depletion of bile salts and the formation of lithogenic bile. There is no evidence that abnormal gallbladder emptying or contractility is a cause of stone formation in Crohn disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatobiliary-manifestations-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], although increased gallstone cholesterol concentrations have been identified in patients following ileoanal anastomosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatobiliary-manifestations-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

However, it is now thought to be a subset of primary sclerosing cholangitis, called small duct primary sclerosing cholangitis. The diagnosis should be suspected in patients with ulcerative colitis who have cholestatic liver function tests and normal large bile duct anatomy. Liver biopsy reveals periportal and periductular fibrosis with a benign mixed cellular infiltration of the portal tracts.

Its course is usually benign; the main manifestation is an increase in cholestatic enzymes such as alkaline phosphatase.

It is more common in men with colonic involvement. There seems to be no relationship to suppurative complications, extraintestinal manifestations, or duration or extent of disease. The amyloid deposits can involve almost any organ, including the liver, resulting in asymptomatic hepatomegaly. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastrointestinal-amyloidosis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastrointestinal amyloidosis: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Optimal therapy consists of controlling the inflammatory component of the Crohn disease, thereby decreasing the release of the acute phase reactant serum amyloid A which is the precursor of the amyloid fibrils in this condition.

Patients present with fever, with or without abdominal pain, jaundice, diarrhea or hepatomegaly. Leukocytosis and elevated serum alkaline phosphatase concentrations are the most common laboratory abnormalities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyogenic-liver-abscess\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pyogenic liver abscess&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The mechanism of abscess formation is unclear. It may be due to direct extension of intraabdominal abscesses or possibly due to portal pyemia with secondary seeding in the liver parenchyma. Successful management requires both drainage of the liver abscess, which can be performed percutaneously under radiologic guidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatobiliary-manifestations-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] and treatment of the underlying Crohn disease.</p><p>The same mechanism may also be important for the development of rare but potentially life-threatening portal vein thrombosis associated with IBD. Successful use of anticoagulation or thrombolytic therapy has been reported in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatobiliary-manifestations-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">PANCREATITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pancreatitis is a rare extraintestinal manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that can result from duodenal fistulas, ampullary Crohn disease, gallstones, primary sclerosing cholangitis, drugs such as 6-mercaptopurine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, or very rarely 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) agents, autoimmune pancreatitis, and primary Crohn disease of the pancreas. In one study, drugs (mainly azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine) were the leading cause of pancreatitis in Crohn disease, and patients with Crohn disease were noted to be at a higher risk for azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine associated acute pancreatitis than patients treated with these drugs for other causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatobiliary-manifestations-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">PRIMARY BILIARY CHOLANGITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a disease characterized by progressive inflammatory destruction of interlobular and septal bile ducts that results in cholestasis and cirrhosis with a strong association with antimitochondrial antibodies.
