It is estimated that less than 10 percent of cardiac deaths after stent placement are attributable to stent thrombosis, with most of the remainder being due to disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-stent-thrombosis-incidence-and-risk-factors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Stent thrombosis within the first year appears to occur with similar frequency in patients with bare metal stents (BMS) or drug-eluting stents (DES), as long as patients are treated with dual antiplatelet therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> plus a platelet P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor blocker) for the recommended duration. The period of risk requiring dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is longer with DES, due at least in part to delayed neointimal coverage, although this difference is decreasing with newer generation DES.

Compared with those on DAPT, the hazard ratio for major adverse cardiovascular events (a composite of cardiac death, definite or probable stent thrombosis, spontaneous myocardial infarction, or clinically indicated target lesion revascularization) was significantly higher only for those with disruption (1.50); it was significantly lower for those with discontinuation (0.63). It was nonsignificantly higher for patients with interruption (1.41, 95% CI 0.94-2.12).

The impact of disruption on the risk of stent thrombosis was greater in the first 30 days compared with after 30 days. </p><p>However, similar to many other preventative interventions, the optimal use of DAPT does not ensure that a patient will not experience stent thrombosis. For example, in an observational study of over 10,000 patients undergoing drug-eluting stent (DES) placement, those with early stent thrombosis were on DAPT 86 percent of the time and those with late stent thrombosis were on DAPT 57 percent of the time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-stent-thrombosis-incidence-and-risk-factors/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

A probable explanation for an increased risk of thrombosis in first generation DES compared to BMS after cessation of antiplatelet therapy is delayed arterial healing, particularly incomplete neointimal coverage. However, rates of very late stent thrombosis with newer generation DES, such as EES or R-ZES, are lower than earlier generation DES. Thus, any difference between BMS and newer DES in the rate of very late stent thrombosis may be small. </p><p>Documentation of very late stent thrombosis has come from real-time imaging studies using either angioscopy or optical coherence tomography (OCT), from postmortem examination of stented segments in patients with and without stent thrombosis, or from the histology of in-stent restenosis tissue obtained by atherectomy.</p><p>An angioscopic study of 37 consecutive stented lesions (15 <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> stents and 22 BMS) showed that neointimal coverage is not complete in most patients with SES, but complete with all BMS at three to six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-stent-thrombosis-incidence-and-risk-factors/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Delayed neointimal coverage in patients with SES was confirmed in a longer-term study of 17 SES and 11 BMS in which angioscopy was performed at 4, 10, and 21 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-stent-thrombosis-incidence-and-risk-factors/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. There were two main findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neointimal coverage was complete in all but one of the patients with BMS at 3.6 months and in all at 10 months.

These limitations are not present with OCT, an intravascular imaging technique that visualizes the surface of a stent with higher resolution than intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-stent-thrombosis-incidence-and-risk-factors/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>].

The leading associated findings in descending order were malapposition, neoatherosclerosis, uncovered struts, and stent underexpansion. These associations were similar in early- and new-generation DES.</p><p>These findings are consistent with those in two postmortem studies and analysis of atherectomy specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-stent-thrombosis-incidence-and-risk-factors/abstract/48,56,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,56,59</a>].

The most powerful histologic predictor of stent thrombosis was incomplete endothelial coverage (uncovered struts).</p><p>Similar findings were noted in the second postmortem study in which delayed arterial healing was more pronounced in 14 DES patients with late stent thrombosis than in nine patients without stent thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-stent-thrombosis-incidence-and-risk-factors/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. In addition, patients with DES had a greater degree of delayed arterial healing and less complete re-endothelialization than patients with BMS.</p><p>Current smoking and total stent length &gt;28 mm have been identified as risk factors for very late stent thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-stent-thrombosis-incidence-and-risk-factors/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Whether these play a role by influencing the rate of arterial healing is not known.</p><p>In-stent neoatherosclerosis has also been seen in many cases of very late stent thrombosis. Neoatherosclerosis in stents, similar to native coronary vessels, is characterized by macrophage-mediated degradation of collagen with necrotic core formation that predisposes to plaque rupture and thrombosis. In BMS, neoatherosclerosis rarely occurs before three years and is more common in those greater than six years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-stent-thrombosis-incidence-and-risk-factors/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. In DES, neoatherosclerosis is accelerated and can be a cause of thrombosis in stents less than two years after implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-stent-thrombosis-incidence-and-risk-factors/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].

In the SIRIUS trial, for example, the exclusion criteria included ostial, bifurcation, and unprotected left main lesions, and vessels with thrombus or severe calcification; in addition, multivessel stenting was not performed and patients with a recent MI or a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 25 percent were excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-stent-thrombosis-incidence-and-risk-factors/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p>There has been concern whether the risk and timing of stent thrombosis (ST) may be different for these excluded or so-called off-label indications (more complex disease). At least two studies have suggested that the risk of ST in patients who received BMS or DES for off-label indications is higher than for those with on-label indications at both early and later time points [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-stent-thrombosis-incidence-and-risk-factors/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. This is not surprising, as the baseline risk of patients with off-label indications is higher. For example, these individuals often have an acute coronary syndrome.</p><p>In previous, smaller studies, each of the more common off-label indications was found to be associated with an increased risk of stent thrombosis.
