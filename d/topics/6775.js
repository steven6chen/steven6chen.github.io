It can occur in chronic stable or unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure with and without severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, and an anomalous coronary artery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-syndromes-of-stunned-or-hibernating-myocardium\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical syndromes of stunned or hibernating myocardium&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Since the ischemic myocardium remains viable, the LV dysfunction can be partially or completely restored to normal by improving blood flow or by reducing oxygen demand. Both the reduction in resting coronary blood flow in hibernating segments and the improvement following percutaneous coronary intervention have been directly demonstrated by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Positron emission tomography (PET) has shown that regions with abnormal wall motion may still be metabolically active; these are the regions that can improve after revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In an autopsy series, 52 percent of myocardial segments that were hypokinetic had normal myocardium when examined histologically, compared with only 7 percent of akinetic or dyskinetic segments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Hibernating myocardium has been thought to be different from stunned myocardium in which myocardial dysfunction persists for a variable period after transient myocardial ischemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52865\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52865 \">table 2</a>). However, several observations suggest that the difference between hibernation and stunning may be one of degree: in hibernation, resting blood flow is low, whereas in stunning resting flow is normal but maximal blood flow is reduced, leading to the hypothesis that hibernation may result in some cases from repetitive stunning, secondary to repeated episodes of ischemia, or from chronic stunning (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F62157\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62157 \">figure 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

The finding of improved wall motion function would be accepted more confidently if it were reflected in improved global LV systolic function or left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).

The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive accuracy of nitroglycerin contrast ventriculography for the detection of hibernating myocardium is only 76 percent, 65 percent, and 70 percent, respectively. However, if LV wall segments improve with nitroglycerin preoperatively, there is an 85 percent chance of their improving with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Inotropic stimulation/postextrasystolic potentiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With inotropic stimulation caused by low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> or postextrasystolic potentiation, the ventriculogram may appear to show an improvement in akinetic wall motion segments by increasing the force of contraction of the normal myocardium leading to a tethering effect on the akinetic segment.</p><p>Despite this limitation, inotropic stimuli may demonstrate reversible abnormal wall motion, a response that appears to be similar to that seen with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. As an example, one study found that low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> left ventriculography is a useful technique for identifying myocardial viability, especially in patients with a suboptimal dobutamine echocardiographic study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. A positive response to inotropic stimuli predicts a better short-and long-term survival with CABG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].</p><p>In patients with global LV dysfunction due to an ischemic cardiomyopathy, improvement in global LV function or LVEF with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> may be of greater importance than reversibility of a regional wall motion abnormality. In one study of 56 patients with an ischemic cardiomyopathy and multivessel coronary disease, a dobutamine radionuclide ventriculogram, which provides an objective quantification of LV function, was performed to assess viability; a 10 percent increase in global LVEF with low dose dobutamine had a sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 67, 93, 91, and 72 percent, respectively, for improvement in LV function after CABG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Concern about the augmentation of myocardial oxygen demand with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> infusion has led to the evaluation of inamrinone (formerly known as amrinone), an inotropic agent which does not significantly increase oxygen demand because it also induces coronary vasodilation. One study evaluated 44 patients with coronary disease and an LVEF below 40 percent; inamrinone was infused at a dose of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> body weight and LVEF measured with radionuclide ventriculography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. An increase in LVEF of &ge;10 percent with inamrinone predicted the same increase in LVEF after CABG, while those with a lesser change with inamrinone had little, if any, improvement after CABG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Increased inotropy can also be observed on ventriculography or echocardiography by measuring the change in LVEF following an induced or spontaneous premature beat (ie, the degree of postextrasystolic potentiation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Noninvasive testing with thallium or technetium sestamibi rMPI or PET is often performed to identify the presence of dysfunctional segments that are viable. The major rMPI techniques are thallium stress-redistribution-reinjection single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), thallium rest-redistribution SPECT, and technetium-sestamibi SPECT. PET with the use of tracers to detect myocardial metabolism is an alternative method. The role of myocardial imaging in the detection of myocardial viability is discussed in detail elsewhere and the relative efficacy of the different tests is reviewed below.

In comparison, rMPI can identify segments with fewer viable myocytes. In one series, for example, dobutamine echocardiography and thallium imaging showed equivalent sensitivity among segments with more than 75 percent viable myocytes (78 versus 87 percent) but dobutamine was much less sensitive among segments with 25 to 50 percent viable myocytes (15 versus 82 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Atropine</a> may be given with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> to enhance the diagnostic value of the technique by increasing myocardial blood flow; in one series, atropine was necessary in 36 percent of patients to evaluate myocardial viability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

In a study of 35 patients with prior MI and regional akinesia or dyskinesia, resting end-diastolic wall thickness and low dose dobutamine-induced systolic wall thickening were assessed by CMR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Dobutamine-induced wall thickening was a better predictor of residual metabolic activity on PET (sensitivity 81 percent specificity 95 percent) than end-diastolic wall thickness (sensitivity 72 percent and specificity 89 percent). If at least one CMR parameter was used to identify viability, the sensitivity was 88 percent and specificity was 87 percent.</p><p>However, a region of thinned myocardium may be viable with potential for structural and functional recovery following revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Also, normal ventricles have significant regional variation in viable myocardial thickness.

Regions of myocardium exhibiting late (or delayed) gadolinium enhancement (LGE) coincide with regions of myocardial necrosis and irreversible injury; regions that fail to hyperenhance are viable. In addition, quantitative perfusion assessment can document the reduction in resting coronary blood flow in hibernating segments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

This was illustrated in a study of 50 patients with coronary artery disease who had LV dysfunction prior to surgical or percutaneous revascularization; 33 percent of myocardial segments in 80 percent of patients had late myocardial enhancement; 38 percent of segments had abnormal contractility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. After revascularization, more dysfunctional segments without enhancement improved (78 versus 17 percent with enhancement of &gt;75 percent of the tissue).</p><p>The likelihood of improvement in regional contractility after revascularization decreased progressively as the transmural extent of hyperenhancement increased. The percentage of the left ventricle that was dysfunctional and not enhanced was significantly related to the degree of improvement in LVEF.</p><p>A similar relationship was noted in another series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. An additional finding was that, among the nonenhancing or minimal enhancing segments that did not improve after revascularization, 36 percent showed new late enhancement on the early postoperative CMR scan.</p><p>Magnetic resonance myocardial tagging is another CMR method that quantifies local myocardial segment shortening throughout the LV myocardium at sites across the LV wall thickness. When combined with low dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a>, this method can quantify the amount of myocardial viability, based upon myocardial shortening and thickening, after an acute MI and may provide prognostic information.
