They work by killing bacteria that are in the body. These medicines come in many different forms, including pills, ointments, and liquids that are given by injection.</p><p>Antibiotics can do a lot of good. For people with serious bacterial infections, antibiotics can save lives. But people use them far too often, even when they're not needed. This is causing a very serious problem called antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic resistance happens when bacteria that have been exposed to an antibiotic change so that the antibiotic can no longer kill them. In those bacteria, the antibiotic has no effect. Because of this problem, doctors are having a harder and harder time treating infections. Experts worry that there will soon be infections that don't respond to any antibiotics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179433801\"><span class=\"h1\">When are antibiotics helpful?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibiotics can help people fight off infections caused by bacteria. They <strong>DO NOT</strong> work on infections caused by viruses.</p><p>Some common bacterial infections that are treated with antibiotics include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Strep throat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pneumonia (an infection of the lungs)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bladder infections</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infections you catch through sex, such as gonorrhea and chlamydia</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179433816\"><span class=\"h1\">When are antibiotics NOT helpful?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibiotics do not work on infections caused by viruses.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics are <strong>NOT</strong> helpful for the common cold, because the common cold is caused by a virus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics are <strong>NOT</strong> helpful for the flu, because the flu is caused by a virus. (People with the flu can be treated with medicines called antiviral medicines, which are different from antibiotics.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics are <strong>NOT</strong> helpful for most cases of sore throat, because sore throat is usually caused by a virus. (Strep throat is an exception.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics are <strong>NOT</strong> helpful for most cases of sinusitis, because sinusitis is usually caused by a virus. Sinusitis that starts out as a viral infection can turn into a bacterial infection, but that takes time. If you have had sinusitis symptoms for less than 10 days, you should not take antibiotics unless you also have a high fever.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics are <strong>NOT</strong> helpful for most cases of acute bronchitis (an infection in the airways leading to the lungs), because bronchitis is usually caused by a virus. If you have bronchitis and cough up green mucus, that does NOT mean you have a bacterial infection.</p><p/><p>Even though antibiotics don't work on infections caused by viruses, people sometimes believe that they do. That's because they took antibiotics for a viral infection before and then got better. The problem is that those people would have gotten better with or without an antibiotic. When they get better with the antibiotic, they think that's what cured them, when in reality the antibiotic had nothing to do with it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179433831\"><span class=\"h1\">What's the harm in taking antibiotics even if they might not help?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are many reasons you should not take antibiotics unless you absolutely need them:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Antibiotics cause side effects</strong>, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. They can even make it more likely that you will get a different kind of infection, such as yeast infection (if you are woman).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Allergies to antibiotics are common</strong>. You can develop an allergy to an antibiotic, even if you have not had a problem with it before. Some allergies are just unpleasant, causing rashes and itching. But some can be very serious and even life-threatening. It is better to avoid any risk of an allergy, if the antibiotic wouldn't help you anyway.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Overuse of antibiotics leads to antibiotic resistance</strong>. Using antibiotics when they are not needed gives bacteria a chance to change, so that the antibiotics cannot hurt them later on. People who have infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria often have to be treated in the hospital with many different antibiotics. People can even die from these infections, because there is no antibiotic that will cure them.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179433846\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I take antibiotics?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should take antibiotics only when a doctor or nurse prescribes them to you. You should never take antibiotics prescribed to someone else, and you should not take antibiotics that were prescribed to you for a previous illness. When prescribing an antibiotic, doctors and nurses have to carefully pick the right antibiotic for a particular infection. Not all antibiotics work on all bacteria.</p><p>If you do have an infection caused by a bacteria, your doctor or nurse might want to find out what that bacteria is, and which antibiotics can kill it. They do this by taking a &quot;culture&quot; of the bacteria and growing it in the lab. But it's not possible to do a culture on someone who has already started an antibiotic. So if you start an antibiotic without input from a doctor or nurse it will be impossible to know if you have taken the right one.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179433861\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to reduce antibiotic resistance?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Here are some things that can help:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not pressure your doctor or nurse for antibiotics when he or she does not think you need them.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you are prescribed antibiotics, finish all of the medicine and take it exactly as directed. Never skip doses or stop taking the medicine without talking to your doctor or nurse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not give antibiotics that were prescribed to you to anyone else.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not use antibacterial soaps or cleaning products. (Alcohol-based hand gels are fine to use.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179433876\"><span class=\"h1\">What if my doctor prescribes an antibiotic that did not work for me before?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If an antibiotic did not work for you before, that does not mean it will never work for you. If you have used an antibiotic before and it did not work, tell your doctor. But keep in mind that the infection you had before might not have been caused by the same bacteria that you have now. The &quot;best&quot; antibiotic is the right one for the bacteria causing the infection, not for the person with the infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179433893\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I am allergic to an antibiotic?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you had a bad reaction to an antibiotic, tell your doctor or nurse about it. But do not assume you are allergic unless your doctor or nurse tells you that you are.</p><p>Many people who think they are allergic to an antibiotic are wrong. If you get nauseous after taking an antibiotic, that does NOT mean you are allergic to it. Nausea is a common side effect of many antibiotics. If you are a woman and you get a yeast infection after taking an antibiotic, that does <strong>NOT</strong> mean you are allergic to it. Yeast infections are a common side effect of antibiotics.</p><p>Symptoms of antibiotic allergy can be mild and include a flat rash and itching. They can also be more serious and include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hives &ndash; Hives are raised, red patches of skin that are usually very itchy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79242\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79242 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lip or tongue swelling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble swallowing or breathing</p><p/><p>Serious allergy symptoms can start right after you start taking an antibiotic if you are very sensitive. Less serious symptoms, on the other hand, often start a day or more later.</p><p>If you think you are allergic to antibiotics, tell your doctor or nurse why you think so. Then trust him or her to know whether what you describe is a true allergy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179433908\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cough-runny-nose-and-the-common-cold-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cough, runny nose, and the common cold (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cough-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cough in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sinusitis-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sinusitis in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sinusitis-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sinusitis in children (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergy-to-penicillin-and-related-antibiotics-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Allergy to penicillin and related antibiotics (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-common-cold-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: The common cold in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-common-cold-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: The common cold in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-sinusitis-sinus-infection-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Acute sinusitis (sinus infection) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
