In approximately 90 percent of cases, it leads to a severe combined immunodeficiency (ADA-SCID) with dysfunction of T, B, and natural killer (NK) cells (T-B-NK- SCID) that presents in the first few months of life. However, there are also a few patients with a later onset and relatively milder disease. The wide spectrum of the ADA deficiency phenotype is largely related to the variability in genetic mutations.</p><p>All patients should begin treatment as soon as the diagnosis is established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Early intervention is critical since life-threatening opportunistic infections are not unusual in the first weeks or months of life. Furthermore, the accumulation of toxic metabolites may interfere irreversibly with the ontogenic development of the immune system.</p><p>The treatment of ADA deficiency is presented in this topic review. The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of ADA deficiency are discussed separately, as is the related combined immunodeficiency disorder, purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adenosine deaminase deficiency: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=purine-nucleoside-phosphorylase-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Gene therapy and hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for primary immunodeficiencies are also discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gene therapy for primary immunodeficiency&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-primary-immunodeficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematopoietic cell transplantation for primary immunodeficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL MEASURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exposure to contagious illnesses should be minimized as best as possible. Patients should receive prophylactic antibiotics, including <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii </em>(<em>carinii</em>) prophylaxis. Patients with adenosine deaminase (ADA)-severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) are at increased risk of antibiotic-induced myelotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Certain products should NOT be administered, including live vaccines or nonirradiated, cytomegalovirus (CMV)-positive blood products. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Immune globulin</a> replacement therapy, including additional respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prophylaxis, should be given. A detailed discussion of these and other issues related to general protective measures in patients with immune deficiency is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-immunodeficiency-overview-of-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary immunodeficiency: Overview of management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID): An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">HEMATOPOIETIC CELL TRANSPLANTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The definitive treatment of choice is hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) from a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling donor (matched sibling donor [MSD]) or matched family donor (MFD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/2,4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4-8</a>]. In most instances, no immunosuppressive conditioning is needed since the ADA+ lymphoid cells of the donor have a survival advantage over the ADA- lymphoid cells of the host. The best outcomes are seen when HCT is performed early, before any opportunistic infection or advanced immune attrition occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. HCT, when successful, is almost uniformly curative of the immunodeficiency. In addition, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis also reverses after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, transplantation does not seem to impact the neurologic complications of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-primary-immunodeficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematopoietic cell transplantation for primary immunodeficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Reported survival is &gt;80 percent in several multicenter, retrospective studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/1,2,8,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,8,15-17</a>]. In one of these analyses of 106 patients who underwent 119 transplantations, overall survival was 86 and 81 percent in those who received MSD or MFD transplants, respectively, with a median posttransplant follow-up of 6.5 years (range, 1.6 to 27.6 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In contrast, survival for matched, unrelated donor; haploidentical (mismatched at three of the six HLA loci), related donor; and mismatched, unrelated donor transplantations was 67, 43, and 29 percent, respectively. The majority of deaths occurred in the first 100 days after HCT.</p><p>Unfortunately, HLA-identical siblings are available in only approximately 15 percent of all patients, and grafts from histoincompatible donors invariably result in fatal graft-versus-host disease. Despite advances in transplantation biology that have allowed for successful transplantation with haploidentical stem cell purified by various methods to remove post-thymic T cells, the three-year survival rate after mismatched and haploidentical transplants is still low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/2,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12</a>]. For haploidentical transplantation, parental donors are preferable over other family members [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. Recipient cytoablation prior to transplantation of haploidentical grafts and treatment of the graft to remove mature T cells to avert the risk of graft versus reaction increase the morbidity in the pre-engraftment period. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Donor selection for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Engraftment of haploidentical transplant usually takes considerably longer than with histoidentical transplants. Functional T cells may take four to seven months to appear, and engraftment may be incomplete. By comparison, B cell engraftment may take years, and, in many cases, the B cells remain of host origin. Even after successful engraftment of identical and haploidentical transplants, fatal or nearly fatal viral infections may occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ENZYME REPLACEMENT THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the greater risks involved in haploidentical grafts, other treatment avenues, including enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), have been explored for patients who do not have a histoidentical donor. Adenosine and deoxyadenosine rapidly cross the cell membrane and can be detoxified by circulating free adenosine deaminase (ADA) or by ADA-positive donor red blood cells. In addition, in vitro incubation of ADA-negative lymphocytes with exogenous ADA can restore lymphocyte mitogenic responses and increase the percentage of lymphocyte rosettes with sheep red blood cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Exchange transfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first attempt to treat ADA-deficient patients with ERT was by transfusion of frozen irradiated red blood cells from ADA+ donors every two to four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/20-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-28</a>]. This modality has the adverse effect of iron overload and is now obsolete due to the introduction of polyethylene glycol-modified bovine ADA (PEG-ADA).</p><p>Exchange transfusions of irradiated ADA+ blood have, however, been instrumental in the understanding of ERT and its limitations. The transfused ADA+ red cells were capable of extensively taking up and degrading the accumulated toxic substrates. Plasma levels of adenosine decreased significantly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/20,26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,26-28</a>]. In addition, urinary excretion of deoxyadenosine decreased to approximately one-tenth of that before transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Reductions of deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) in red blood cells and in lymphocytes decreased significantly in some, but not all, patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In two patients, the levels of dATP in red blood cells and in lymphocytes remained elevated during exchange transfusions. This suggests that dATP may not be in reversible equilibrium with deoxyadenosine once accumulated in lymphocytes and therefore may continue to block the other three ribonucleotides required for DNA synthesis. This finding may explain why transfusion therapy or PEG-ADA often inadequately improves in vitro and in vivo lymphocyte functions and has only transient clinical benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the younger of two siblings with ADA deficiency who was treated from infancy, exchange transfusions resulted in near-normal immune reconstitution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. This patient was later switched to treatment with PEG-ADA and is healthy in the third decade of life. The older sibling, diagnosed at age 20 months during an episode with <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> (<em>carinii</em>) pneumonia, had only a partial response to exchange transfusion, but is still alive and well while on PEG-ADA treatment. The improved response to PEG-ADA may have been due to the introduction of higher ADA levels.</p><p/><p>Involution of the thymus in patients with ADA deficiency is well described. It is possible that the magnitude of the immune reconstitution by ERT is to some extent dependent upon the magnitude of a pre-existing thymic involution. A radiographic thymic shadow was still visible in the younger sibling in whom ERT was initiated at age five weeks, while this was not the case in the older sibling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In the older sibling, a deficiency in circulating thymic hormones was noted for several years while on exchange transfusion and resolved only after a switch to PEG-ADA ERT. In contrast, others have also shown that the reduction of prime toxic metabolites by exchange transfusion resulted in a prompt rise in serum thymic hormone activity in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Polyethylene glycol-ADA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The limitations of ERT with exchange transfusions led to the introduction of intramuscular PEG-ADA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. The advantage of using PEG is that it prolongs the half-life of ADA by blocking access sites on the ADA protein surface, thereby preventing enzymatic degradation and formation of specific anti-ADA antibodies. PEG-ADA decreases red blood cell deoxyadenosine and deoxyadenosine nucleotides. In addition, the levels of adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, which is inactivated by deoxyadenosine, are restored in bone marrow and red blood cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The half-life of PEG-ADA is two to three days, and, therefore, once or twice weekly injections may suffice.</p><p>PEG-ADA treatment restores immune function to near normal or normal and has a lower mortality than haploidentical stem cell transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. However, despite these benefits, many patients still succumb to lymphomas and viral infections. The cost of this treatment for adult patients is also extremely high. It costs approximately $100,000 to $300,000 per year in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. A new PEG-ADA product using recombinant bovine ADA is under study; early data suggest that it is more stable than the first-generation ADA that contains human ADA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Some patients treated with PEG-ADA develop anti-ADA antibodies that severely affect enzymatic activity of the product in a minority of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In one report, an infant diagnosed with ADA deficiency at 14 months demonstrated clinical improvement during the first five months of therapy, with partial immune reconstitution and nearly normal lymphocyte subsets. Between four and seven months, the patient developed immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to bovine ADA that led to the reversal of the immune recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Dosing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A starting dose of 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> per week is generally recommended. Once metabolic correction is established and clinical improvement is attained, the dose is generally decreased to a maintenance dose of 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> per week. The dose is adjusted depending upon metabolic normalization (ADA levels, deoxyadenosine levels) and immune reconstitution. The typical dose in successfully treated adolescent and adult patients is 375 units administered twice weekly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Immune reconstitution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical effects of PEG-ADA are remarkable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/33,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,38</a>]. There is a marked improvement in cell-mediated immunity, with an increase in T lymphocytes and in vitro lymphocyte mitogenic responses. The author and colleagues have followed four patients with ADA deficiency on PEG-ADA treatment for 12 to 24 years. All have had infrequent and only minor infections and have had an improvement in B and T cell functions to near-normal values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], although each patient has responded somewhat differently:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one patient, treatment with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> could only be discontinued after six years of PEG-ADA therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second patient succumbed to non-Hodgkin lymphoma at the age of 16 years, although his immunoreconstitution following PEG-ADA treatment was almost complete and he did not have opportunistic infections.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In sibling patients, immune reconstitution varied over time due to periods of nonadherence with therapy. In one, the B cell percentage (2 to 3 percent) and absolute numbers (15 to <span class=\"nowrap\">25/microL)</span> remained low. In vitro lymphocyte mitogenic responses to pokeweed mitogen and to Staph Cowan A (a B cell mitogen) remained markedly decreased. Paradoxically, this patient had borderline to normal specific antibody responses to measles (live measles vaccine was given before the diagnosis of ADA deficiency was made), tetanus, diphtheria, and pneumococci. He also had no serious bacterial infections or any opportunistic infection. Following exposure to chickenpox, he had a mild disease course that was modified by the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varicella-zoster-immune-globulin-human-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">varicella-zoster immune globulin</a> (VZIG) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a>. Several months postinfection, a normal antibody response to varicella was noted that still persists.</p><p/><p>However, failure of PEG-ADA to induce immune reconstitution also has been reported in several patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Long-term efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Somewhat different results concerning the long-term efficacy of PEG-ADA (16 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> per week) were reported in a retrospective study of nine patients treated for 5 to 12 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Immune globulin</a> replacement therapy was continued for three to seven years and then stopped in most patients, with two requiring ongoing therapy. Most patients remained in good health, with an absence of major infections. Despite this, lower than normal levels of T, B, and natural killer (NK) lymphocytes, as well as decreased in vitro T cell immune function, were observed at most time points. Specifically, the initial improvement in T cell numbers observed one to three years after treatment initiation was followed by a progressive decline to levels similar to those observed at the time of presentation.</p><p>One possible explanation for the gradual immune deterioration observed in this series of patients is intermittent nonadherence with PEG-ADA therapy. The author and colleagues have noted a precipitous decline of immune function (both B and T cell) in their patients following periods of nonadherence, with only partial reconstitution after therapy is reinstated. It may be that every prolonged increase in toxic metabolites can cause a loss of immune function that is partly irreversible. PEG-ADA treatment must be monitored regularly because of this potential effect of nonadherence. The author measures the levels of toxic metabolites in red blood cells at least twice yearly in all patients receiving this therapy and more frequently in some.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Effect on other clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another issue with PEG-ADA treatment is that not all associated clinical features may improve with therapy. The immunodeficiency is believed to be caused by a direct toxic effect of accumulated purine metabolites on immature lymphocytes. Pulmonary insufficiency with diffuse interstitial changes, including dense inflammatory infiltrates and goblet cell hyperplasia, is also thought to be caused by cytotoxic effects of accumulated adenosine in the lung tissue rather than by infection. Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is corrected by ERT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In contrast, hepatocellular damage, with inflammatory infiltrates in the liver and secondary necrosis and fibrosis, can be due to autoimmune inflammation or a cytotoxic process. This was exemplified in a patient with partial ADA deficiency, who had resolution of pulmonary, but not hepatic, disease after treatment with PEG-ADA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The patient's liver disease resolved with glucocorticoid therapy. There is a lack of data regarding the effect of PEG-ADA on the progression of neurologic and behavioral abnormalities and sensorineural deafness associated with ADA deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6926379\"><span class=\"h2\">Carrier erythrocyte encapsulated ADA therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The efficacy of ERT with PEG conjugated ADA is reduced by anti-ADA neutralizing antibody formation. Carrier erythrocyte encapsulated ADA therapy is an alternative means of administering ADA that is under evaluation. In one study, autologous erythrocytes were loaded with ADA using a hypoosmotic dialysis procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The ADA encapsulated in the red blood cells was protected from antigenic stimulation and resulted in sustained therapeutic activity when administered in two to three weekly intervals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">GENE THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gene therapy is another tool in the treatment of a variety of primary immunodeficiencies. Early attempts at gene therapy in the 1990s were by and large unsuccessful, resulting in low percentages of transduced peripheral blood T cells that produced insufficient amounts of adenosine deaminase (ADA) to maintain immune function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/41-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-44</a>]. Several strategies were subsequently employed to improve gene therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>], and it is now considered an effective therapy in infants and young children who lack a compatible sibling donor. Since 2000, over 40 patients with ADA deficiency have been treated with gene therapy throughout the world. Approximately 70 percent of cases have shown successful outcomes, achieving immune reconstitution, restoration of thymic activity, systemic detoxification, and long-term engraftment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/1,45,47-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,45,47-51</a>]. Limited experience suggests that gene therapy is less effective in children over approximately five years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The rationale for and techniques of gene therapy are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gene therapy for primary immunodeficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The two primary strategies employed that are believed to have improved gene therapy outcome are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improving gene transfer efficiency, which led to increased ADA activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enhancing engraftment by a mild nonmyeloablative preconditioning regimen, most commonly with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/45,47,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,47,51</a>]</p><p/><p>The efficacy of a third strategy to improve outcome, discontinuing polyethylene glycol-modified bovine ADA (PEG-ADA) prior to gene therapy, is still unclear. The rationale for discontinuing PEG-ADA was the hypothesis that PEG-ADA might abolish the potential selective advantage of genetically engineered cells over the defective cell population. The first attempt of gene therapy using this strategy was unsuccessful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>], but immune reconstitution was achieved subsequently with multiple infusions of higher numbers of transduced T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. However, a murine model suggests that continued used of PEG-ADA for a few months after gene transfer does not diminish, and may actually promote, engraftment of gene-corrected cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Further research is needed to determine the optimal timing for discontinuation of PEG-ADA in patients undergoing gene therapy.</p><p>The two largest reported series each followed 10 children who lacked a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling donor and were treated with infused autologous CD34+ bone marrow cells genetically corrected with a retroviral vector containing the <em>ADA</em> gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/47,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,51</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the first series, 10 patients were treated with nonmyeloablative conditioning with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a>, and enzyme replacement therapy (ERT)<em> </em>was discontinued after infusion of the cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. All patients were alive and had stably engrafted myeloid and lymphoid cells after a median follow-up of four years. Eight patients had restoration of immune function and decreased rates of severe infections, and two patients required resumption of PEG-ADA. Growth and neuropsychomotor development also improved after gene therapy. No adverse events attributed to the ADA-transduced cells were reported, although adverse events included prolonged neutropenia, catheter-related infections, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation, hypertension, and autoimmune hepatitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the second series, the first four patients were treated without cytoreduction prior to gene therapy, and ERT was continued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Gene therapy was unsuccessful in these four patients. The subsequent six patients in this series received cytoreductive conditioning, and ERT was discontinued prior to gene transfer. Sustained immune recovery off of ERT for a median of four years was demonstrated in three patients. Gene therapy was not successful in the other three patients, two of whom were restarted on ERT and one of whom subsequently underwent hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).</p><p/><p>In another series, B cell tolerance was examined in three patients before and after gene therapy because of the high rate of autoimmune complications seen in patients with ADA deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Both central and peripheral B cell tolerance checkpoints involved in removal of developing autoreactive and antinuclear antibody (ANA)-expressing B cells were abnormal prior to gene therapy and were restored after therapy. However, in another series, some patients still had uncorrected autoreactive B cells after gene therapy and developed autoimmune manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>There have been no reports of leukemia-like illness in patients with ADA deficiency who have undergone gene therapy, in contrast to trials of gene therapy for patients with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), in which lymphoproliferative disease occurred in 25 percent of patients. The ADA gene-containing vector does not appear to have the same propensity for inducing lymphoproliferation, although the basis for this difference is not clear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">THYMIC AND FETAL LIVER GRAFTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thymic and fetal liver grafts have also been used to treat adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency. The author and colleagues noted a marked increase in T cell percentages and in vitro lymphocyte mitogenic responses in one patient following a fetal liver transplant and two thymic epithelial transplants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. An initial biopsy of the transplant showed engraftment with an actual increase in the graft dimensions and a decrease in serum adenosine and deoxyadenosine levels. However, all reconstituted immune parameter disappeared several weeks later, and the graft was rejected. Similar disappointing results were reported using cultured thymic epithelia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">INHIBITION OF DEOXYNUCLEOSIDE KINASES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies in a chimeric <span class=\"nowrap\">human/mouse</span> fetal thymic organ culture model of adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency revealed that the effects of ADA inhibition were reversible by treatment with two deoxynucleoside kinase inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Experimental treatment with a deoxycytidine kinase inhibitor alone in two children with ADA deficiency did not provide clinical benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. However, therapy with multiple deoxynucleoside kinase inhibitors may be useful as an adjunct to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) or transplantation. Further studies are needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4174741152\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Hematopoietic cell transplantation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adenosine deaminase deficiency: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) phenotype'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a matched sibling or family donor is not an option, then we suggest gene therapy, if available and not cost prohibitive, for an infant or young child with ADA-deficient SCID (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Limited experience suggests that gene therapy is less effective in children over approximately five years of age. If gene therapy is unsuccessful, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) or HCT with a matched, unrelated donor are still potential treatment options. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Gene therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If neither gene therapy nor a matched sibling or family donor for HCT is available, or if gene therapy or HCT is unsuccessful, we suggest ERT with polyethylene glycol (PEG)-ADA (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Continued treatment with PEG-ADA, rather than gene therapy or transplantation with an unrelated donor, should be considered in patients with a documented long-term favorable response (eg, absence of major infections). Some patients on ERT may need to continue <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> replacement therapy. PEG-ADA, dispensed as 375 units per a vial of 1.5 mL, is administered intramuscularly at a total maintenance dose of 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> body weight per week. The total dose is given as a single weekly injection, or, alternatively, one-half of the total dose is given two times per week. The patient on PEG-ADA must be monitored for adherence to therapy by history and by measurement of <span class=\"nowrap\">serum/red</span> blood cell ADA, deoxyadenosine, and deoxyadenosine triphosphate levels at least twice yearly. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Enzyme replacement therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The final therapeutic option is using an unrelated HLA-identical donor (matched, unrelated donor) or a haploidentical (half-matched) related donor for transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Hematopoietic cell transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The choice of therapy for patients with delayed- or late-onset forms or for those with partial ADA deficiency depends upon the extent of ADA deficiency and symptomatology. These patients are typically treated with ERT, at least initially.
