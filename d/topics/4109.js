These errors are in the range of 1 mutation in 1,000 to 100,000 nucleotides per replication cycle for RNA viruses, and approximately 1 mutation in 100,000,000 nucleotides per replication cycle for DNA viruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The higher mutation rate among RNA viruses is related to the lack of proofreading functions of RNA polymerases and reverse transcriptases. As a result, mutations in viral genomic sequences are generated naturally during viral replication and should be viewed as a normal biological event.</p><p>Hepatitis B virus (HBV), a member of the Hepadnaviridae family, replicates asymmetrically via reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate, making it prone to mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The estimated mutation rate of the hepadnavirus genome is about 2 x 10(4) base <span class=\"nowrap\">substitutions/site/year,</span> about 100 times higher than that of other DNA viruses but about 100 to 1,000 times lower than that of other RNA viruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Although mutations can occur randomly along the HBV genome, the overlapping open reading frames limit the number and location of viable mutations. Because chronic HBV infection frequently persists for decades, many variants may exist within the same host at any given time and each variant may have multiple base changes.</p><p>Selection by the host for the fittest variant occurs after the random mutation process. Fitness may be defined at the cellular level (viruses that replicate most efficiently in a cell type will predominate) or at the extra-cellular level (viruses that avoid immune elimination will become dominant) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Thus, the accumulation of viral variants depends upon the rate at which the variants are generated and the advantage they confer to the virus.</p><p>The genetically different viral species concomitantly present in a single cell or in a single individual are termed quasi-species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Interpretation of the clinical significance of HBV mutations is complicated by the lack of standardized nomenclature, differences in sensitivities of assays used in their detection, and the presence of mutations in more than one region of the HBV genome even in the same species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Despite these difficulties, in vivo analyses of naturally occurring viral variants and in vitro mutagenesis studies have identified some mutations that have a role in viral latency, pathogenesis of liver disease, immune escape, and resistance to antiviral therapy. This topic review will summarize the clinical relevance and molecular characteristics of common HBV variants.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PRECORE AND CORE PROMOTER VARIANTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <span class=\"nowrap\">precore/core</span> region of the HBV genome encodes the nucleocapsid protein (HBcAg) and HBeAg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The core open reading frame has two transcripts with heterogeneous 5' ends and two in-phase initiation codons. HBeAg is translated from the precore mRNA, producing a precursor polypeptide comprising the precore and the entire core region. The precore polypeptide is translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum by a signal peptide. Cleavage of the amino and carboxy termini results in a secretory protein, HBeAg. HBcAg is translated from the pregenomic RNA. Both HBcAg and HBeAg contain B- and T-cell epitopes, of which some are shared. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=characteristics-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus-and-pathogenesis-of-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Characteristics of the hepatitis B virus and pathogenesis of infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Secretion of HBeAg can be modulated at both transcriptional and translational levels. Transcription of the precore and pregenomic RNAs is under the control of regulatory elements including the basic core promoter and the core upstream regulatory sequence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Mutations in these domains decrease precore mRNA transcription and HBeAg synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. At the translational level, mutations within the precore region can block the translation of the precore protein and hence HBeAg. The most common mutation in the precore region is a point mutation (G to A switch at nucleotide 1896), which changes codon 28 from tryptophan to a stop [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. Because this mutation occurs upstream of the core start codon and because HBcAg is translated from a different transcript, nucleocapsid production is not interrupted.</p><p>The biological role of HBeAg in the HBV replication cycle is uncertain. Expression of HBeAg is nonessential for virus replication in animal models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] and in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. HBeAg may act as a tolerogen or a target for immune response. In utero exposure to HBeAg can induce immune tolerance in newborn mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Perinatal transmission of HBV from HBeAg-positive mothers results in chronic HBV infection in the majority of babies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In addition, HBeAg appears to modulate the host's immune response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>]. Precore variants that do not produce HBeAg may be selected because they can evade immune clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Precore variants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common precore variant has a point mutation at nucleotide 1896, creating a stop at codon 28 (G1896A, eW28X). This mutation is accompanied by another point mutation (G to A) at nucleotide 1899 in some patients. In vitro studies have demonstrated that precore protein can inhibit HBV replication, suggesting that precore stop codon variants may enhance viral replication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. However, patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis tend to have lower HBV DNA levels compared to those with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/15,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,27</a>].</p><p>Other naturally occurring mutations in the precore region include point mutations leading to initiation failure as well as deletions and insertions of nucleotides inducing frameshifts. In addition to the eW28X stop codon mutation, the most frequent precore mutations that can abrogate HBeAg production are point mutations in the start codon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p>In a study involving 17 centers in the United States, precore variants were found in 27 percent of patients with chronic HBV infection, being significantly more common among the HBeAg negative than the HBeAg positive patients (38 versus 9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. These data indicate that precore variant is not rare in the United States.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Core promoter variants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common core promoter variant involves a dual mutation A1762T, G1764A (TA change). A number of mutations have been found to occur together with the TA change, including changes at nucleotide 1653, 1753 to 1757, and the dual mutation C1766T G1768A. The latter mutations are most often found in patients with fulminant hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Deletions within the basic core promoter, which overlap with the X gene, have been found to occur in asymptomatic carriers, patients with chronic hepatitis B or HCC, and individuals with no HBV serologic markers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. Infection with these deletion variants is usually associated with low HBV DNA levels.</p><p>In the nationwide United States study, the dual core promoter variants were found in 44 percent of patients with chronic HBV infection, being significantly more common among the HBeAg negative than the HBeAg positive patients (51 versus 36 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Detection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to direct sequencing, several methods can be used to detect precore and core promoter variants including RFLP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>], line probe assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>], ligase chain reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], and colorimetric point mutation assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Some methods such as line probe assay and RFLP are more sensitive in detecting minor variants than direct sequencing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>The controversies surrounding the clinical significance of precore and core promoter variants is related to the heterogeneity of the study population, sensitivity of the methods used to detect these variants, and to the format in which results are reported. Some studies particularly those that rely on less sensitive methods such as direct sequencing only report the presence of variants when the variant is present as the predominant sequence while other studies report the presence of variants when the variant is detected as a minor sequence in a mixed population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Relationship to HBeAg status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Precore variants have been detected mainly in patients who are HBeAg negative but they can also be found in some HBeAg positive patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/14,15,30,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15,30,41</a>]. HBeAg positive patients with precore variants are more likely to undergo spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion and to do so earlier than those with wild type precore sequence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. These findings are in accordance with the observation that precore variants that prevent HBeAg production are selected around the time of HBeAg clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/14,15,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15,41</a>]. However, not all HBeAg seroconversion requires the selection of precore mutations.</p><p>Unlike precore variants, core promoter variants can be detected in similar proportions of HBeAg-negative and HBeAg-positive patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/30,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,44,45</a>]. One study demonstrated that emergence of the dual core promoter (T to A) change was more common among HBeAg-positive patients who subsequently seroconverted compared to those who remained HBeAg positive, indicating that the selection of core promoter variants may play a role in HBeAg clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. This study also found that core promoter variants could be detected earlier than precore variants in patients who cleared HBeAg.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Relationship to HBeAg negative chronic hepatitis B</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Seroconversion from HBeAg to anti-HBe is usually accompanied by decreased levels of HBV replication and remission of liver disease. However, some patients who become HBeAg-negative continue to have high HBV DNA levels and active liver disease, so-called HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B (e-CHB). Many of these patients harbor HBV variants in the precore or core promoter region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/13-15,41,47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15,41,47,48</a>], although some continue to have low levels of wild type HBV. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Precore variants'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Core promoter variants'</a> above.)</p><p>Patients have e-CHB if they meet the following criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HBsAg positive and HBeAg negative</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum HBV DNA &gt;10<sup>4</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/mL</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent or intermittent elevations in aminotransferase levels that cannot be attributed to other causes</p><p/><p>There are clinical differences between patients with e-CHB and those who are HBeAg-positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Patients with e-CHB tend to have lower serum HBV DNA levels and are more likely to have fluctuating serum aminotransferase levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/15,27,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,27,50</a>]. Patients with e-CHB also tend to be older and have more advanced liver disease because they are in a later phase of chronic HBV infection. </p><p>Patients with e-CHB have been reported in all parts of the world but are more common in Mediterranean countries and Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/45,51-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,51-54</a>]. Such patients are estimated to account for 7 to 30 percent of those with chronic hepatitis B worldwide, based upon studies from the 1990s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. However, the exact prevalence of e-CHB is not known since large population-based studies have not been performed. The ratio of e-CHB to HBeAg-positive CHB has increased worldwide because of the decline in new cases of HBV infection secondary to implementation of HBV vaccination and aging of previously infected persons. </p><p>The geographical differences in the relative frequency of e-CHB and HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B are largely related to differences in the distribution of HBV genotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-58</a>]. Different genotypes also account for the heterogeneity of e-CHB around the world. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-significance-of-hepatitis-b-virus-genotypes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical significance of hepatitis B virus genotypes&quot;</a>.) </p><p>As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common HBV variant associated with e-CHB is the precore stop codon variant G1896A, which is usually found in association with the HBV genotype D [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. This genotype is prevalent in the Mediterranean basin. In some countries (eg, Italy and Greece) where HBV genotype D is dominant, &gt;90 percent of patients with chronic HBV infection are HBeAg-negative. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B is rarely detected in association with genotype A (which is prevalent in the United States and North-West Europe). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Studies in Hong Kong found that only 40 percent of patients with e-CHB had the precore variant. HBV genotypes B and C prevail in these areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial studies suggested that precore and core promoter variants were associated with more severe liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/13,15,59-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15,59-62</a>]. However, these variants have also been detected in inactive carriers and patients with minimal liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/40,44,52,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,44,52,56</a>]. Furthermore, precore and core promoter variants had no impact on pre- and post-liver transplant outcomes in a study from the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. It is possible that host immune response and mutations in other regions of the HBV genome may be involved in the pathogenesis of liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>There are increasing data to support an association between core promoter variants and more severe liver disease. A study from Hong Kong found patients with core promoter mutation tended to have higher hepatic necroinflammation score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. The same group reported the prevalence of core promoter mutations was higher among chronic hepatitis B patients who developed complications of cirrhosis and HCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>].</p><p>Another study from Taiwan involving 250 chronic hepatitis B infected patients found that the prevalence of core promoter variants increased from 3 percent among inactive carriers to 64 percent among patients with HCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. When controlling for other potential confounders such as gender, age, genotype and presence of cirrhosis, the core promoter variants (A1762T, G1764A) was still significantly associated with the development of HCC (odds ratio: 10.6). A longitudinal study from Taiwan demonstrated that persistence of core promoter mutations accumulated over time before the diagnosis of HCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Another study from the United States reported that patients with core promoter variants were more likely to have hepatic decompensation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p>The major drawback of the above studies is that the conclusions were based on cross-sectional analyses. As a result, large-scale longitudinal studies with consideration of other host and viral confounders are needed to confirm the relationship between core promoter variants and advanced liver disease. Several studies have confirmed an association between basal core promoter mutations and hepatocellular carcinoma; in a few studies, there has been an association with cirrhosis as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/71-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">71-74</a>]. One study included 2762 Taiwanese men and women with chronic HBV followed between 1991 and 2004 (for a total of 33,747 person years), during which a total of 153 incident cases of HCC were detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. After adjusting for baseline HBV DNA levels, sex, and age of recruitment, the basal core promoter variant <span class=\"nowrap\">A1762T/G1764Aand</span> genotype C were predictors of increased risk of HCC, while the precore variant G1896A was associated with a lower risk of HCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Fulminant hepatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Precore and core promoter variants have been described in association with fulminant hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/7,76-79\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,76-79</a>]. It has been suggested that these variants result in a fulminant course because of enhanced HBV replication or a more aggressive immune response. However, in some studies, these variants were also detected in asymptomatic source patients who led to the outbreak of fulminant hepatitis B [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. The mechanism by which precore variants cause fulminant hepatitis in the new host but an inactive liver disease in the original host is unclear. It is possible that de novo infection with precore variants elicits a more aggressive immune response while precore variants that are selected during the course of infection may escape immune clearance and are associated with less active disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Serum quantitative HBV DNA levels</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a paucity of data on the relationship between <span class=\"nowrap\">precore/core</span> promoter variants and serum quantitative HBV DNA levels. The most comprehensive study was done in the United States and involved a total of 694 consecutive chronic HBV-infected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-and-molecular-characteristics-of-common-hepatitis-b-virus-variants/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. HBeAg-positive patients with core promoter variant had significantly lower serum HBV DNA levels compared to those with wild type sequence in the core promoter region. A possible explanation was the selection of core promoter variants during the process of immune clearance.
