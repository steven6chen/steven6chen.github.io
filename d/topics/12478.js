This topic will discuss aspects of neuraxial anesthesia (NA) that are common to all of these techniques, and the differences among them. The techniques for performing each of them are discussed separately.

The anatomy relevant for neuraxial anesthesia techniques is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-anesthesia-technique#H520190259\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal anesthesia: Technique&quot;, section on 'Anatomy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidural-and-combined-spinal-epidural-anesthesia-techniques#H2557425003\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidural and combined spinal-epidural anesthesia: Techniques&quot;, section on 'Anatomy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H200678350\"><span class=\"h1\">USE OF NEURAXIAL ANESTHESIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neuraxial anesthesia (NA) is most commonly used for lower abdominal and lower extremity surgery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F114662\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114662 \">table 1</a>). The sensory level required for a specific surgery is determined by the dermatome level of the skin incision and by the level required for surgical manipulation; these two requirements may be very different. As an example, a low abdominal incision for cesarean delivery is made at the T11 to T12 dermatome, but a T4 spinal level is required to prevent pain with peritoneal manipulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F106237\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106237 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F106305\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106305 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Spinal, epidural, and combined spinal-epidural (CSE) anesthesia can be used for many of the same surgical procedures. Differences among them may affect the choice of technique for a specific procedure or patient. The advantages and disadvantages of the various neuraxial anesthesia techniques are shown in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F110997\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110997 \">table 3</a>). Spinal anesthesia is usually administered as a single injection, whereas epidural anesthesia is usually administered via a catheter for continuous infusion, and CSE anesthesia combines the two. Continuous spinal anesthesia via a catheter sited in the subarachnoid space is less commonly used than the other techniques. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-anesthesia-technique#H2310354705\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal anesthesia: Technique&quot;, section on 'Continuous spinal'</a>.)</p><p>Catheter-based neuraxial anesthesia (ie, epidural, CSE, and continuous spinal) allows prolonged anesthesia and titration of the onset of the anesthetic. Single-shot spinal or epidural anesthesia is limited to the duration of action of the injected drug.</p><p>The needle for spinal anesthesia must be inserted in a mid- to low-lumbar intervertebral space (below the termination of the conus medullaris), whereas needle placement for an epidural injection can occur anywhere from the distal end of the neuraxial canal (via the sacral hiatus to a high cervical interspace [usually for a chronic pain management procedure]). For example, an epidural catheter can be placed to provide primarily thoracic anesthesia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> postoperative analgesia, with the extent determined by the volume and concentration of the chosen epidural medications. Thus, the specific dermatomes and extent of sensory blockade may be more easily controlled with an epidural injection. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2569371350\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A medical history and anesthesia-directed physical examination should be performed for all patients who undergo any type of anesthesia. If neuraxial anesthesia (NA) is considered, the back should be examined as part of the anesthesia-directed physical examination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preanesthesia-evaluation-for-noncardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preanesthesia evaluation for noncardiac surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When considering NA, we focus the preoperative evaluation on the medical conditions that may alter the physiologic response to NA or increase the risk of complications. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Coagulopathy &mdash; </strong>Patients with abnormal coagulation (ie, with thrombocytopenia, bleeding disorders, receiving anticoagulants) are at increased risk of spinal bleeding during or after neuraxial anesthesia. (See <a href=\"#H2261682\" class=\"local\">'Spinal-epidural hematoma (SEH)'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Systemic and local skin infection &mdash;</strong> Patients with systemic infection, and with skin infection at the site of spinal or epidural needle puncture may be at increased risk for central nervous system (CNS) infection with neuraxial anesthesia. Spinal and epidural needles should not be inserted through obviously infected skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Chronic infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is not considered a contraindication to spinal anesthesia since the central nervous system (CNS) is infected early in the course of the disease. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The use of NA in patients with other viral infections is controversial. Primary infection with herpes simplex (HSV) and varicella zoster (VZV) is associated with a period of viremia, whereas secondary infection (manifest with oral or genital lesions) is not. Although data are limited, most anesthesiologists are comfortable initiating spinal anesthesia during a secondary HSV outbreak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuraxial-anesthesia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], while avoiding insertion of the NA needle through active herpetic skin lesions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Practice Advisory for the Prevention, Diagnosis, and Management of Infectious Complications Associated with Neuraxial Techniques states that there is insufficient evidence to assess whether prophylactic antibiotic therapy reduces the risk of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuraxial-anesthesia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The Advisory recommends that alternative anesthetic techniques be considered in patients at high risk for infection and that preprocedure antibiotic administration be considered when a neuraxial technique is chosen for patients with known or suspected bacteremia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Preload dependent cardiac lesions &mdash;</strong> Patients with preload-dependent cardiac lesions (eg, aortic stenosis or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) are at risk for a profound decrease in cardiac output and hypotension as a result of the sympathectomy that accompanies NA. Management modifications for these patients may include invasive monitoring, incremental initiation of neural blockade, and fluid and vasopressor administration. (See <a href=\"#H867437\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypovolemia &mdash; </strong>Hypovolemia increases the risk of hypotension with onset of NA because of the induced sympathectomy; volume status should be normalized prior to initiation of NA, and incremental dosing and invasive blood pressure monitoring may be required.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Spine abnormalities</strong> &mdash; NA for patients with spine abnormalities (eg, scoliosis, spinal stenosis, disk disease, radiculopathy, prior spine surgery, spina bifida) may be technically challenging or impossible, or associated with increased risk of neurologic complications. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Anatomic distortion, surgical scarring, or spine hardware can obliterate the landmarks used for performance of NA techniques. Ultrasound guidance may help in some cases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Distribution of NA medications may be affected by anatomic distortion or postsurgical changes, and result in inadequate anesthesia or analgesia. This is more likely with an epidural technique, which relies on spread of the drug in the epidural space.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with preexisting neurologic compromise (eg, radiculopathy, spinal stenosis) may be at increased risk of postoperative neurologic complications after NA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuraxial-anesthesia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>NA (usually spinal anesthesia) is an option for patients with paraplegia or quadriplegia, in particular to avoid intraoperative autonomic dysreflexia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-adults-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury#H1843177\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for adults with chronic spinal cord injury&quot;, section on 'Autonomic dysreflexia'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Progressive neurologic disease &mdash;</strong> Patients with some progressive or episodic neurologic diseases (eg, multiple sclerosis, or postpoliomyelitis) are probably not at increased risk of new or worsened neurologic deficits because of neuraxial anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuraxial-anesthesia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, the signs and symptoms of such diseases may worsen in the postoperative period because of the stress of surgery, perioperative fever, or infection. Preexisting neurologic deficits should be documented, and the unknown risks of worsened neurologic disease should be discussed preoperatively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-care-of-the-surgical-patient-with-neurologic-disease#H2564825824\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative care of the surgical patient with neurologic disease&quot;, section on 'Multiple sclerosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intracranial mass lesion with intracranial hypertension</strong> <strong>&mdash;</strong> Patients with raised intracranial pressure from a mass lesion are at risk for cerebral herniation with spinal anesthesia, or with an unintentional dural puncture during epidural anesthesia, and NA is usually avoided in these patients. Dural puncture is generally considered safe in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hydrocephalus with shunt &mdash;</strong> NA has been used in patients with shunts in place to treat hydrocephalus, including lumboperitoneal shunts. Theoretical considerations include leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (with local anesthetic) through the shunt and the risk of shunt infection. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3402158812\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preoperative laboratory testing should be performed as it would be for general anesthesia, based on the patient&rsquo;s medical status and the planned surgical procedure.

The magnitude of various physiologic effects depends on the extent and speed of onset of the block, and patient factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H867437\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiovascular</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypotension and bradycardia are the most common and important physiologic effects of neuraxial anesthesia, and are the result of sympathetic blockade and associated reflexes. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypotension </strong>&mdash;<strong> </strong>Hypotension occurs in as many as 47 percent of spinal anesthetics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuraxial-anesthesia/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>], as a result of a decrease in systemic vascular resistance, peripheral blood pooling with decreased venous return to the heart, or both. These two effects result from the sympathetic block that accompanies spinal anesthesia, and from block of adrenal medullary secretion. Higher levels of sympathetic block are associated with an increased risk of hypotension; with spinal block below approximately T4, vasoconstriction above the level of the block may compensate and mitigate the decrease in blood pressure. In addition, block of cardioaccelerator fibers (originating from T1 to T4 nerve roots) with high spinal can contribute to hypotension through a decrease in heart rate and cardiac output. When the same dermatomal block is achieved with epidural and spinal anesthesia, there is a similar incidence of hypotension, although the onset of hypotension may be slower with epidural anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuraxial-anesthesia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Risk factors for hypotension include hypovolemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuraxial-anesthesia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], age &gt;40 to 50 years, emergency surgery, obesity, chronic alcohol consumption, and chronic hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuraxial-anesthesia/abstract/5,6,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bradycardia </strong>&mdash;<strong> </strong>Clinically significant bradycardia occurs in 10 to 15 percent of spinal anesthetics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuraxial-anesthesia/abstract/6,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9</a>]. The incidence of bradycardia with epidural anesthesia depends on the level and extent of the block. Mechanisms for bradycardia are direct (blockade of sympathetic cardioaccelerator fibers) and indirect. Indirect mechanisms include decreased output of the myocardial pacemaker cells due to decrease in venous return, stimulation of low-pressure baroreceptors in the right atrium and vena cava, and stimulation of mechanoreceptors in the left ventricle resulting in bradycardia (paradoxical Bezold-Jarisch reflex) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuraxial-anesthesia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Risk factors for bradycardia during spinal anesthesia include age &lt;50 years, baseline heart rate &lt;60 beats per minute (bpm), American Society of Anesthesiology physical status 1 (ie, healthy, no medical problems), current beta blocker therapy, prolonged PR interval, and block height above T6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuraxial-anesthesia/abstract/6,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A small subset of patients develops severe bradycardia that may progress to cardiac arrest. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Neuraxial anesthesia can also cause first, second, and third degree heart block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuraxial-anesthesia/abstract/11-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-16</a>]. The incidence of heart block in this setting is unknown; proposed mechanisms are the same as those for bradycardia. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H867593\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High NA can cause paralysis of accessory muscles of respiration, and can theoretically lead to bronchospasm.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Respiratory mechanics</strong> &mdash; NA block to a midthoracic level has minimal respiratory effects in patients without pulmonary disease. While intercostal muscles may be paralyzed with a thoracic block, diaphragmatic function is maintained. Therefore, resting tidal volume and the forced expiratory volume in one <span class=\"nowrap\">second/forced</span> vital capacity <span class=\"nowrap\">(FEV1/FVC)</span> ratio are unchanged, and maximum inspiratory volume, vital capacity, and FEV<sub>1</sub> are minimally decreased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuraxial-anesthesia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In contrast, high spinal block with paralysis of accessory muscles may impair active exhalation and cough, such that peak expiratory flow, maximal minute ventilation, and expiratory reserve volume are reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuraxial-anesthesia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. These effects can be important for patients with pulmonary secretions or obstructive pulmonary disease, who depend on accessory muscles of respiration to cough or maintain ventilation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bronchial tone</strong> &mdash; Bronchial tone at rest is controlled in part by the balance between parasympathetic and sympathetic bronchial tone. Theoretically, the sympathetic block associated with high spinal anesthesia may allow parasympathetic predominance, and lead to bronchospasm. This effect appears to be of little clinical significance. A study of thoracic level epidural anesthesia in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease reported no increase in airways resistance with sympathetic blockade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuraxial-anesthesia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-patients-with-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease#H144230942\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&quot;, section on 'Neuraxial anesthesia'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2863919650\"><span class=\"h2\">Central nervous system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients often appear and feel sedated during NA. A number of studies have found a reduction in requirements for sedatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuraxial-anesthesia/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>] and an increase in self-reported and observed sedation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuraxial-anesthesia/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>] in patients who undergo spinal anesthesia, compared with those who have not had anesthesia. The unproven hypothesis for this phenomenon is that NA decreases afferent input to the reticular activating system in the brain, resulting in sedation. </p><p>The level of sedation associated with spinal anesthesia can increase over the course of the first 60 minutes after injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuraxial-anesthesia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Therefore, sedative medication should be administered in reduced, incremental doses during NA anesthesia, and should be accompanied by continuous monitoring of respiration and consciousness. </p><p>Cerebral blood flow is autoregulated; therefore, blood flow to the brain remains unchanged during NA unless there is a profound drop in blood pressure below the lower limit of autoregulation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1328556647\"><span class=\"h2\">Thermoregulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with general anesthesia, hypothermia can occur during NA, and may be more likely with higher levels of block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuraxial-anesthesia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. We use active warming methods (ie, warming blankets, fluid warmers) during NA as we would during general anesthesia.</p><p>Patient temperature maintenance in the operating room is multifactorial, and depends on anesthetic effects, operating room temperature, administered fluid volume and temperature, and the duration of anesthesia. Several mechanisms may be responsible for heat loss during epidural and spinal anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuraxial-anesthesia/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sympathetic block redistributes blood flow from the core to the periphery, resulting in loss of heat to the environment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heat production is decreased because of a decrease in metabolic rate below the level of the block.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compensatory mechanisms (ie, shivering and vasoconstriction) are blocked below the sensory level.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central thermoregulation is impaired because of blocked peripheral afferent input.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1506173879\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastrointestinal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sympathetic innervation to the abdominal viscera originates from spinal levels T6 to L1. Parasympathetic innervation to the abdominal viscera is via the vagus nerve, which is not blocked during neuraxial anesthesia. Therefore, depending on the extent of blockade, neuraxial anesthesia results in sympatholysis while maintaining parasympathetic innervation, leading to a contracted gut, relaxed sphincters, and normal peristalsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuraxial-anesthesia/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. This effect can promote the return of gastrointestinal motility after abdominal surgery. A meta-analysis of 22 trials including approximately 1100 patients who underwent abdominal surgery reported that epidural analgesia with local anesthetic with or without opioids reduced the time to first flatus and first bowel movement, compared with opioid analgesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuraxial-anesthesia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>The effects of NA on hepatic blood flow are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-the-patient-with-liver-disease#H1881900285\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for the patient with liver disease&quot;, section on 'Choice of anesthetic technique'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3754064554\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Direct effects of NA on renal function are of little clinical significance, as long as blood pressure and intravascular volume are maintained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuraxial-anesthesia/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Innervation to the kidney originates at spinal levels T10 to L1. Neuraxial blockade may alter renal function by several mechanisms, both direct and indirect. Changes in blood pressure, cardiac output, and endocrine function may indirectly affect renal blood flow. Neuraxial blockade may directly affect efferent nerves to the kidney or alter reflex responses due to afferent nerve blockade. However, in healthy individuals, a large reserve protects the kidney from harm, and neuraxial blockade has little physiologic effect as long as hydration is adequate and blood pressure is maintained within the range of autoregulation. In the presence of hypotension, urine output may decrease, but adequate renal oxygenation is maintained, and urine output returns to normal once blood pressure returns to normal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2261645\"><span class=\"h1\">ADVERSE EFFECTS AND COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serious and permanent complications of neuraxial anesthesia are very rare. In a prospective audit report from the UK, the incidence of permanent injury from neuraxial anesthesia was 4.2 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuraxial-anesthesia/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. This report also highlighted that most injuries resolved within six months. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4202569205\"><span class=\"h2\">High or total spinal anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Total spinal anesthesia can be a complication of either spinal or epidural anesthesia. It may result from the unrecognized and unintentional injection of medication intended for the epidural space into the subdural or subarachnoid space (via a malpositioned catheter or needle) or an overdose of medication injected into the epidural space. The reported incidence in the obstetric population is 1 in 4336 neuraxial blocks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuraxial-anesthesia/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. It usually occurs within a few minutes following administration of local anesthetic, but can also occur up to 40 minutes later with changes in patient position. The signs and symptoms include a rapid ascending sympathetic, sensory, and motor block with associated bradycardia, hypotension, dyspnea, and difficulty with swallowing or phonation. Symptoms can progress to unconsciousness (due to brainstem hypoperfusion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> brainstem anesthesia), and respiratory depression (secondary to respiratory muscle paralysis and brainstem hypoperfusion). If a large dose of local anesthetic is unintentionally injected into the subarachnoid space, unconsciousness and respiratory depression may be the initial signs of a total spinal anesthesia. </p><p>Injection of local anesthetic solution or saline into the epidural space either before [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuraxial-anesthesia/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>] or after [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuraxial-anesthesia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>] a spinal injection can result in a higher than expected level of spinal anesthesia, or even total spinal anesthesia. Single injection spinal should be performed with caution following failed epidural anesthesia with an appropriate dose of local anesthetic solution. If spinal anesthesia is attempted, a reduced local anesthetic dose should be considered. In one small study in patients who had combined spinal-epidural anesthesia, patients who had 10 mL of saline injected into the epidural space 10 minutes after spinal injection had a higher spinal level 10 minutes later than patients who had no saline injected (mean spinal level T7 versus T11) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuraxial-anesthesia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Total spinal anesthesia has been described when spinal anesthesia was initiated following failed epidural anesthesia, and is one of the most common serious complications of obstetric anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuraxial-anesthesia/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

Unintentional injection of local anesthetic solution into this space (usually intended for the epidural space) may cause a patchy block that results in more extensive cranial anesthesia than expected after epidural injection, with an onset intermediate between spinal and epidural anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuraxial-anesthesia/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

In an audit study from the United Kingdom, the incidence of nerve injury following neuraxial anesthesia for surgical anesthesia (not obstetric) was estimated to be as high as 1.6 per 100,000, if injuries that were not definitively caused by the anesthetic were included in the calculation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuraxial-anesthesia/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

However, persistent paresthesia after NA is rare. In a retrospective study of spinal anesthetics, 6.3 percent of patients reported a paresthesia, but only 0.1 percent had persistent postoperative paresthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuraxial-anesthesia/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Should a paresthesia occur, needle advancement should be halted. If the paresthesia persists, the needle should be withdrawn.</p><p>Damage to the conus medullaris may occur during spinal anesthesia if the clinician unintentionally performs spinal anesthesia at a high lumber interspace. Although the spinal cord typically ends at the body of the L1 vertebra in adults, the length varies and may extend lower in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuraxial-anesthesia/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Anesthesia clinicians frequently misidentify the intended interspace, and the actual interspace is cephalad to the intended interspace, sometimes by more than one interspace [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuraxial-anesthesia/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Thus, the clinician may be initiating spinal anesthesia at a high- rather than mid-lumber interspace, thereby increasing the risk for direct trauma to the conus medullaris.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9031637\"><span class=\"h2\">Back pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Localized point tenderness may be present for several days after a neuraxial procedure, but there is no evidence that neuraxial procedures result in long-term backache.

Onset of pain is typically within 2 to 24 hours after the complete resolution of spinal anesthesia. Pain may be described as mild to severe, usually aching in nature, radiating from the lower <span class=\"nowrap\">back/gluteal</span> region to the posterior thighs. It is often improved by ambulation and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug therapy, and usually resolves after several days without sequelae.

The overall incidence of TNS was 8.5 percent, and the risk of TNS with lidocaine was approximately 1 in 7. Other risk factors included patient position (lithotomy) and type of surgery (knee). Dilution of lidocaine with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or saline does not decrease the incidence of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neuraxial-anesthesia/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. </p><p>The true incidence of TNS with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mepivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mepivacaine</a> is unclear.

Decisions about anesthetic technique should be made at the individual patient level based on a number of factors, including patient, surgeon, and anesthesiologist preference; type of surgical procedure; the patient's comorbid diseases; and plan for postoperative analgesia. </p><p>In addition, the following issues may affect the decision to choose neuraxial anesthesia:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Perioperative process </strong>&mdash; The use of neuraxial anesthesia (NA) may modestly increase intraoperative time and recovery room stay for ambulatory procedures.

The mechanism(s) is unclear, and it is not known if this effect is dependent on the type and extent of neuraxial anesthesia, duration (ie, intraoperative or postoperative), or neuraxial drugs (eg, local anesthetics, opioids).
