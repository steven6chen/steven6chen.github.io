It happens when people hurt their Achilles tendon. Tendons are strong bands of tissue that connect muscles to bones. The Achilles tendon connects the calf muscles to the heel bone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53890\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53890 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>You use your Achilles tendon when you walk, run, and jump.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25517879\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes Achilles tendinopathy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Achilles tendinopathy can happen when people:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suddenly increase their exercise or activity (such as running)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do the same exercises or activities (such as jumping) over and over</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Don't warm up their calf muscles before exercising</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise in shoes or sneakers that are worn-out or not made for exercise</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have arthritis or a bone growth on the back of their heel bone &ndash; This can rub against the tendon and hurt it.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25517894\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of Achilles tendinopathy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common symptoms are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the back of the leg, just above the heel &ndash; The pain usually gets worse with exercise and better with rest.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stiffness or soreness in the back of the leg, especially in the morning</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling of the skin over the Achilles tendon</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble standing on tiptoe</p><p/><p>Sometimes, an Achilles tendon tears. Doctors call this a &quot;rupture.&quot; Symptoms of an Achilles tendon rupture can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sudden, severe pain in the back of the leg</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble putting weight on the foot or walking normally</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25517909\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for Achilles tendinopathy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. But your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have it by learning about your symptoms and doing an exam. Your doctor or nurse might order an X-ray or other test to check if another condition is causing your symptoms.</p><p>If your doctor or nurse thinks that you tore your Achilles tendon, you might have an imaging test called an MRI. This test can create pictures of the tendon.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25517924\"><span class=\"h1\">How is Achilles tendinopathy treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Achilles tendinopathy usually gets better on its own, but it can take months to heal completely. To help your symptoms get better, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rest your Achilles tendon and avoid activities that cause pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ice the area &ndash; If your pain gets worse after activity, put a cold gel pack, bag of ice, or bag of frozen vegetables on the injured area every 1 to 2 hours (for up to 6 hours), for 15 minutes each time. Put a thin towel between the ice (or other cold object) and your skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wrap your ankle with an elastic bandage (or other wrap) &ndash; This can help keep your tendon from moving too much. Your doctor or nurse will show you how to wrap your ankle correctly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take medicine to reduce the pain &ndash; Your doctor might recommend that you take a medicine to relieve pain, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand names: Aleve).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do exercises to make your calf muscles stronger and more flexible &ndash; Your doctor or physical therapist (exercise expert) will show you which exercises to do.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25517939\"><span class=\"h1\">What if my symptoms don't get better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your symptoms don't get better, your doctor might suggest other possible treatments. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A device to wear in your shoe or around your ankle to keep your foot in a position where it can heal properly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25517954\"><span class=\"h1\">How is an Achilles tendon rupture treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A tendon rupture is usually treated with surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25517969\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do to keep from getting tendinopathy again?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To lower the chance of getting Achilles tendinopathy again, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Warm up your muscles before you exercise. For example, if you run, you can warm up your muscles by jogging slowly and then slowly increasing your pace.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid sudden increases in your exercise or activity. When you begin a sport or activity, start off slowly. Over time, you can exercise harder and for longer periods of time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid running or exercising outside in cold weather. If you need to be outside, wear warm clothes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear the correct sneakers or shoes for your sport or activity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Replace worn-out sneakers or shoes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid running on hard surfaces.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25517984\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
