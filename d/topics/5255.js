Emphysematous areas, by definition, lack walls. However, this distinction may be difficult to discern, as interlobular septa surrounding emphysematous areas of lung may be misinterpreted as walls (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F112789%7EPULM%2F112790\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef112789 graphicRef112790 \">image 1A-B</a>). Some forms of atypical emphysema present as lucencies that are indistinguishable from cysts.

They most commonly arise in the setting of acute bacterial pneumonia, typically in children, but can also result from <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> pneumonia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F56620\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56620 \">image 9</a>), chest trauma, or barotrauma from mechanical ventilation. While usually few in number, pneumatoceles can occasionally be numerous and in such cases, can be confused with the more diffuse cystic lung diseases.

However, the earliest and often overlooked manifestation of the disease is the development of cutaneous fibrofolliculomas on the midface, which can be seen beginning in the third decade of life.

Diffuse cystic lung disease must be distinguished radiographically from emphysema, honeycombing, cystic bronchiectasis, pulmonary cavities, and pneumatoceles. (See <a href=\"#H2761318205\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The four most common cystic lung diseases are lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis (PLCH), Birt-Hogg-Dub&eacute; syndrome (BHD), and lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (LIP). Other rare causes of cystic lung disease are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F113736\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113736 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2837648319\" class=\"local\">'Causes of cystic lung disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The manifestations of cystic lung disease are typically not specific for a particular disorder. Patients may present with cysts incidentally discovered on computed tomography (CT) obtained for other reasons. Alternatively, they may present with nonspecific cough or dyspnea or with pneumothorax or a pleural effusion. (See <a href=\"#H2884891779\" class=\"local\">'Suspecting an etiology for cystic lung disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A detailed history with attention to demographics (age, sex, and ethnicity), smoking history, and family history (eg, features of tuberous sclerosis complex [TSC] or BHD) is important in the initial assessment. A careful search for extrapulmonary features, including cutaneous, pleural, and intra-abdominal manifestations, can provide insight into the diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F113738\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113738 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2884891779\" class=\"local\">'Suspecting an etiology for cystic lung disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is an essential component of the evaluation process and often can differentiate between the various cystic lung diseases, especially when reviewed by an expert radiologist. (See <a href=\"#H2174985367\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our diagnostic approach starts with review of the clinical and radiographic features to narrow down the diagnostic possibilities, followed by focused testing to confirm the diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F113238\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113238 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2857910956\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory assessment can be used to establish a diagnosis of LAM (serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor-D level &ge;800 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL)</span> and can help identify patients with a systemic rheumatic disease that would increase the likelihood of LIP. For patients without characteristic skin fibrofolliculomas, genetic testing for folliculin (<em>FLCN</em>) gene variants may be indicated for patients with suspected BHD. (See <a href=\"#H2416120570\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When tissue confirmation is required in patients with suspected LAM or PLCH, bronchoscopy with transbronchial lung biopsy and appropriate immunostaining (ie, human melanoma black [HMB]-45 for LAM; CD1a antigen for PLCH) may be diagnostic in some cases. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) showing CD1a antigen staining on 5 percent or more cells is considered supportive of PLCH. (See <a href=\"#H2933225811\" class=\"local\">'Bronchoscopy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients without a clear diagnosis despite the above evaluation, particularly in the setting of progressive disease, surgical lung biopsy can be used to provide a definitive diagnosis of disorders associated with specific histopathology (LAM, PLCH, LIP). A lung biopsy is not indicated in disorders not associated with specific histopathology (eg, BHD) unless an alternate or co-existent process is suspected. (See <a href=\"#H3046239237\" class=\"local\">'Surgical lung biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin biopsy of a folliculoma may be diagnostic in BHD or prompt genetic testing for folliculin variants for confirmation. (See <a href=\"#H1621643725\" class=\"local\">'Skin biopsy'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-the-adult-with-cystic-lung-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Gupta N, Vassallo R, Wikenheiser-Brokamp KA, McCormack FX.
