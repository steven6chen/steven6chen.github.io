Malignant pleural effusion can be caused by metastatic disease, lymphoma and other, hematologic malignancies, or primary pleural malignancy (eg, mesothelioma). Paramalignant pleural effusions result from tumor effects that indirectly act on the pleural space such as by bronchial obstruction, mediastinal lymph node infiltration, thromboembolism, or superior vena cava syndrome; pleural fluid cytology and pleural biopsy are negative by definition because cancer cells have not invaded pleural membranes. MPEs, on the other hand, have infiltration of cancer cells into pleural tissue that may result in positive fluid cytology <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pleural biopsy for cancer.</p><p>When clinicians encounter a patient with an MPE, they frequently ask:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is the prognosis?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Should the effusion be treated?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the treatment options?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How do I know which option is best?</p><p/><p>The diagnosis of pleural effusions, including MPEs, and the management of refractory nonmalignant pleural effusions, are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-a-pleural-effusion-in-adults-initial-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of a pleural effusion in adults: Initial testing&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-refractory-nonmalignant-pleural-effusions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of refractory nonmalignant pleural effusions&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prognosis of patients with an MPE depends on a variety of factors, such as age, performance status, tumor type, tumor stage, comorbidities, composition of the pleural fluid, and responsiveness of the underlying cancer to antitumor therapy. Overall, observational studies demonstrate that mortality is higher for patients with an MPE as compared with those with metastatic cancer without a malignant effusion. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer with distant metastases, one study demonstrated that the presence of a malignant effusion was an independent predictor of a lower overall survival at one and two years (hazards ratio [HR] 1.36, 95% CI 1.30-1.43) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The median survival among 417 patients identified in a systematic review was four months after the recognition of an MPE, although some patients may have a prolonged survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A series of 278 patients referred to a thoracic surgery clinic for management of an MPE found a median postoperative survival of 211 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A series of 789 patients from three centers who presented with their first episode of an MPE varied in median survival based on the underlying tumor type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Median survivals ranged from 74 days for patients with lung cancer to 339 days for patients with mesothelioma.</p><p/><p>Multiple factors have been examined to predict survival of patients with MPEs to assist in selecting an appropriate approach to management. The largest series with prospective data collection that assessed prognostic factors derived and validated a risk stratification system called the LENT score (pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] performance score, blood neutrophil&ndash;to-lymphocyte ratio, and tumor type) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The four factors combined into the LENT score had greater prognostic value than individual factors and identified patients with the lowest one, three, and six month survivals. The receiver operating curve area, however, ranged from 0.77 to 0.85 for prediction of survival at one-month and six-month respectively, so uncertainty regarding prognosis remains when applying the LENT score or other prognosticators to individual patients. </p><p>The importance of tumor type in influencing survival at least partly derives from the responsiveness to therapy of the underlying tumor. As an example, patients with a lymphoma or breast cancer that is responsive to chemotherapy are more likely to have prolonged survival compared to those with an effusion due to non-small cell lung cancer. Additional studies suggest that MPEs due to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant non-small cell lung cancer may respond to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] although most patients become resistant to this therapy after a year. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision to use a pleural intervention to treat a malignant effusion depends upon the presence of respiratory symptoms of which dyspnea is the most common and prominent. Some tumor types, such as breast or ovarian cancer or lymphomas, may respond to therapy directed at the underlying tumor with resolution of the effusion. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymptomatic MPEs do not need to be treated as long as they remain asymptomatic, although nearly all malignant effusions eventually become symptomatic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic malignant effusions that do not respond to treatment of the underlying tumor require consideration of palliative therapy directed at the pleural space.</p><p/><p>Because successful management of an MPE is palliative and without survival benefit, clinicians should focus on patient-centered goals of therapy, which include sustained symptom relief, improvement in quality of life, patient and family acceptability of an intervention, affordability, and preference for less invasive procedures and attendant complications that take patients from home and disrupt the course of their remaining life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Although no specific approach to the management of an MPE prolongs survival, misguided strategies can worsen symptoms and shorten survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OPTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approaches to the management of an MPE are shown in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F66725\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66725 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Patients who have symptoms caused by an MPE should initially undergo therapeutic thoracentesis to drain the fluid. An initial thoracentesis does not decrease the effectiveness of subsequent procedures to produce pleurodesis. The rate of reaccumulation of the pleural effusion, functional status, pulmonary elastance, responsiveness of the pleural effusion to systemic antitumor therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation directed at the underlying tumor, the patient's prognosis, the severity of the patient's symptoms, institutional resources and expertise with various therapies, and patient preferences should guide the subsequent management choices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Antitumor therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Slow reaccumulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients whose MPE reaccumulates slowly (eg, more than one month) may be managed with repeat therapeutic thoracentesis. This is particularly appropriate if patients also have a short (&lt;3 months) expected survival and poor performance status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Thoracentesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple repeat therapeutic thoracentesis is a simple approach to managing MPEs that reaccumulate slowly. Briefly, topical analgesia is administered and then a catheter is percutaneously advanced under ultrasound guidance into the pleural space using sterile conditions. A large volume of pleural fluid is then drained. The procedure can be performed at the bedside or in an office setting with appropriate monitoring. Additional details about the technique of thoracentesis are provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasound-guided-thoracentesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasound-guided thoracentesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Reexpansion pulmonary edema (REPE) is rare following large volume thoracentesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. A safe threshold rate or volume of pleural fluid removal that will not cause reexpansion pulmonary edema has not been identified. In our experience, it is generally safe to continue to remove pleural fluid, as long as the procedure is terminated if the patient develops anterior chest pain or the pleural pressure drops below -20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. If pleural pressure monitoring is not used, removal of pleural fluid beyond 1.5 L should be accompanied by careful attention to the development of chest symptoms and consideration of the relative merit of removing more fluid for greater symptom relief versus the small potential risk of REPE. Cough is often noted during lung reexpansion and does not correlate with development of REPE.</p><p>Repeated thoracentesis may induce pleural adhesions that can complicate thoracoscopic pleurodesis if that procedure becomes indicated. The role for repeated thoracentesis has decreased with the advent of tunneled pleural catheters, which avoid the need for frequent clinic visits for pleural drainage. Other complications of therapeutic thoracentesis are the same as those for diagnostic thoracentesis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasound-guided-thoracentesis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasound-guided thoracentesis&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Rapid reaccumulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A more aggressive intervention is required for most patients because the MPE recurs rapidly (eg, less than one month) after an initial thoracentesis. Options include indwelling pleural catheter drainage, pleurodesis by various techniques (chest tube, thoracoscopic, pleuroscopic), pleurectomy, and pleuroperitoneal shunt. Definitive procedures such as these generally result in fewer subsequent pleural procedures and fewer pneumothoraces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Indwelling pleural catheter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Placement of an indwelling pleural catheter (also known as a tunneled pleural catheter) with intermittent outpatient drainage by the patient or a patient attendant is our preferred initial step for most patients with recurrent malignant effusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/15-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-20</a>]. This method is preferred as primary therapy because it is the least invasive option and requires little if any time in the hospital, as the catheter may be placed during an outpatient procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/10,21-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,21-27</a>]. This was best illustrated by one randomized trial that found that patients with indwelling catheters in patients for malignant pleural effusions spent fewer days in hospital than those who underwent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=talc-sterile-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">talc pleurodesis</a> (10 versus 1 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. On the other hand, pleurodesis offers a greater probability of rapid resolution of the pleural effusion although there is a likely probability of late failure after six months requiring additional interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Moreover, measures of quality of life or dyspnea do not differ significantly between the two procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/17,28,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,28,30</a>]. </p><p>Indwelling pleural catheter drainage is indicated when there is irremediable lung entrapment or endobronchial obstruction by tumor; in these patients, chemical pleurodesis is contraindicated due to high failure rates when the lung is unable to expand against the chest wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Indwelling pleural catheters may improve symptoms following a failed pleurodesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p>Complications include bleeding, catheter blockage, catheter fracture on removal, and, in particular, infection along the catheter tract or within the pleural space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/17,18,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18,33,34</a>]. One study examined the cost-effectiveness of indwelling pleural catheters as compared with pleurodesis and found that tunneled catheters were more cost-effective in patients with survival less than three months while <a href=\"topic.htm?path=talc-sterile-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">talc pleurodesis</a> was more cost-effective in those with longer survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. These findings require validation in other studies that include patients with a wide spectrum of underlying tumors and in different health care settings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-management-of-pleural-causes-of-unexpandable-lung\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and management of pleural causes of unexpandable lung&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The patient or a family member will need to be able to perform pleural fluid drainage via the indwelling pleural catheter at home and maintain catheter sterility.</p><p>Indwelling pleural catheters provide a high degree of symptom relief, as demonstrated in a retrospective analysis of 250 pleural catheter procedures (223 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Dyspnea resolved following 39 percent of the procedures and improved in another 50 percent. Additional observational studies have demonstrated that patients who chose indwelling catheters as opposed to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=talc-sterile-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">talc pleurodesis</a> have fewer total hospital days, fewer effusion-related hospital days, fewer subsequent procedures to control effusion-related symptoms, and better quality of life within seven days of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/24,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,35</a>]. One randomized study found that indwelling pleural catheters, as compared with talc pleurodesis, had a lower hospital stay, fewer admissions, and fewer reinterventions with a similar improvement in dyspnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Two randomized trials have compared indwelling catheter drainage and pleurodesis in terms of outcomes such as palliation of dyspnea, lung re-expansion, procedure related complications, and quality of life and found similar results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. In the larger of two trials, 106 patients with MPEs were randomly assigned to placement of an indwelling catheter or pleurodesis with talc slurry via a 12-French chest tube placed over a guidewire [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. No significant difference was found in post-procedure dyspnea, chest pain, or quality of life scores between the groups. Twelve patients in the talc group required additional pleural procedures compared with three in the indwelling catheter group (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.04-0.86). However, adverse events (eg, pleural or skin infection, catheter blockage) were more common in the indwelling catheter group. One multicenter study demonstrated a low incidence of infection (5 percent) from indwelling pleural catheters with an overall mortality risk from infections of 0.29 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Fifty-four percent of the infections in this study could be treated with antibiotics without removal of the chest catheter. Pleurodesis occurred in 62 percent of patients who experienced a catheter-related infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Indwelling pleural catheters appear to be relatively safe in patients undergoing chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>] and in those with MPEs due to hematologic malignancies; the cumulative incidence of all complications of 13.6 percent and cumulative incidence of all serious catheter related complications was 9.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Pleurodesis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Choosing among the options'</a> below.) </p><p>Spontaneous pleurodesis may occur in approximately 50 to 70 percent after 2 to 12 weeks of indwelling pleural catheter drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. In one study, catheter drainage achieved pleurodesis in 70 percent at a mean interval of 90 days after catheter placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. A randomized trial of 149 patients with MPEs treated with indwelling catheters demonstrated that daily catheter drainage of 1 liter of fluid, as compared with every other day drainage of 1 liter resulted in more frequent occurrence of spontaneous pleurodesis (47 versus 24 percent, respectively) and a shorter median time to pleurodesis (54 versus 90 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. When drainage ceases, the indwelling pleural catheter can be removed. However, catheter removal is associated with fracture of the catheter in 10 percent with occasional retention of a catheter fragment in the pleural space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Among four patients with retained catheter fragments, no complications were reported during a mean follow up of 459 days.</p><p>For those patients who do not develop a spontaneous pleurodesis after days to weeks of drainage, a pleural sclerosant can be instilled through the catheter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/15,42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,42-44</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chemical-pleurodesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chemical pleurodesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For those patients in whom continued drainage is preferred but is prohibited due to catheter-related loculations, the instillation of an intrapleural fibrinolytic agent (tissue-plasminogen activator, urokinase, or streptokinase) may be of benefit as suggested by a multicenter uncontrolled observational study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. However, a randomized controlled trial of the instillation of urokinase as compared with placebo in patients with malignant effusions drained by standard chest tubes (not indwelling catheters) did not show benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. More data are needed before intrapleural fibrinolytics can be recommended for patients with loculated MPEs. (See <a href=\"#H3708422\" class=\"local\">'Intrapleural fibrinolytic agents'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Pleurodesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision to undergo pleurodesis is often based upon an anticipated survival of longer than three months and the patient's desire for an effective therapy that can be carried out in a single definitive procedure, rather than the potential inconvenience of having a long-term indwelling catheter that requires intermittent drainage if spontaneous pleurodesis does not occur. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Indwelling pleural catheter'</a> above.)</p><p>The type of pleurodesis (chemical versus mechanical), sclerosing agent (talc versus other), chest tube size (large- versus small-bore), choice of analgesic agent (opiate versus nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory [NSAID]) varies considerably among centers and experts. Based upon data derived from retrospective studies, a meta-analysis, and randomized trials of patients with MPE, we prefer chemical pleurodesis using talc slurry via a small-bore chest tube because the advent of bedside ultrasonography has allowed this procedure to be performed by the bedside with optimization of drain placement within the chest. It is also well tolerated by patients with treatment with opioid <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> NSAID analgesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/10,47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,47,48</a>]. However, existing studies do not clearly demonstrate superiority of talc slurry over talc poudrage or small versus large bore chest tubes in terms of pleurodesis efficacy at three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. So other approaches that use thoracoscopic administration of talc by poudrage, talc slurry by large bore chest tubes, or performance of thoracoscopic mechanical pleural abrasion followed by continued drainage with a large bore chest tube appear to be effective options. Moreover, some clinicians routinely perform pleurodesis during a thoracoscopic or pleuroscopic procedure that diagnoses the pleural malignancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3761315851\"><span class=\"h4\">Chemical pleurodesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chemical pleurodesis refers to obliteration of the pleural space by the induction of pleural inflammation and fibrosis using a sclerosant (usually talc). The sclerosant can be instilled via a small- or large-bore chest tube or indwelling catheter (talc slurry) or it can be administered at the time of thoracoscopy (video assisted thoracoscopy or pleuroscopy) or thoracotomy (talc <span class=\"nowrap\">insufflation/poudrage)</span>. We prefer chemical pleurodesis via a small-bore chest tube rather than via thoracoscopy because the former is as effective, less invasive, and better tolerated in our experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. However, thoracoscopic chemical pleurodesis is an appropriate alternative in some patients. Choosing among these options usually depends upon the medical circumstances, goals and preferences of the patient, and institutional practice. As an example, thoracoscopy may be preferred in those with a concomitant indication for thoracoscopy or those in whom diagnosis of pleural malignancy is made during thoracoscopy. In contrast, administration via a chest tube may be preferred in patients with cardiopulmonary compromise who cannot tolerate thoracoscopy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=talc-pleurodesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Talc pleurodesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-thoracoscopy-pleuroscopy-diagnostic-and-therapeutic-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical thoracoscopy (pleuroscopy): Diagnostic and therapeutic applications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The introduction of sclerosant via small-bore chest tube or during video-assisted thoracoscopy have similar efficacy in studies of patients with MPE due to a variety of cancers, including malignant mesothelioma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/49-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-52</a>]. As an example, a randomized trial of 282 patients with MPE reported similar rates of radiographic recurrence at 30 days in those in whom sclerosant was administered via a chest tube compared with thoracoscopic administration (29 versus 22 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. However, respiratory complications were less common in those who received a sclerosant using a chest tube (6 versus 14 percent). </p><p>The technical aspects of chemical pleurodesis and the associated complications are discussed in greater detail elsewhere.

NSAIDs and opiates are frequently prescribed by clinicians for pain control. Animal studies had suggested that NSAIDs decrease the efficacy of pleurodesis. In a randomized study of patients with MPE, a similar rate of pleurodesis failure was noted in patients treated with opiates (10 to 20 mg oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> four times daily) when compared with patients treated with NSAIDs (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> 800 mg three times daily) (20 versus 23 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

The authors also reported that pleurodesis success was negatively influenced by high intrapleural tumor burdens, which is especially common in patients with mesothelioma. One meta-analysis reviewed 62 randomized trials of pleurodesis and suggested that talc by poudrage is the most effective sclerosing agent and mode of talc delivery into the chest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

We individualize management with a goal of removing the chest tube after 24 hours of instillation of the sclerosant but may maintain the chest tube in place for up to 72 hours for patients who have exceptionally large volumes of ongoing drainage.

The procedure involves complete drainage of the pleural fluid under thoracoscopic guidance, placement of a tunneled pleural catheter, and insufflation of sterile talc (5 g). At the end of the procedure, a 24 gauge chest tube is placed through the port created for the thoracoscope, attached to suction overnight and removed 24 hours later. The indwelling catheter is drained three times a day on the first postoperative day, twice on the second and third postoperative days, and then once daily until the output is less than 150 mL per day. A chest radiograph is then obtained and the tunneled catheter removed if no reaccumulation of pleural fluid is noted. Details regarding the performance of thoracoscopy are provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-thoracoscopy-pleuroscopy-diagnostic-and-therapeutic-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical thoracoscopy (pleuroscopy): Diagnostic and therapeutic applications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The combination of thoracoscopic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=talc-sterile-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">talc pleurodesis</a> and indwelling catheter placement was assessed in a series of 30 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].

Successful pleurodesis was noted in 24 of the 26 patients who were still alive at six months; the remaining two still required intermittent drainage using the catheter. The indwelling catheter was removed at a mean of 16.6 days and a median of 7.5 days following the procedure. Adverse effects included fever in two patients, need for replacement of the indwelling catheter due to pleural loculations in one patient, and an empyema in one patient. Another consecutive case series of 30 patients found that pleuroscopy combined with indwelling catheter placement as compared with historical controls of conventional pleuroscopy had a similar success rate for pleurodesis but shorter hospital stay, shorter time to pleurodesis, and better control of symptoms in those patients who fail pleurodesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. An uncontrolled study of 29 patients undergoing talc pleurodesis by pleuroscopy and insertion of a tunneled pleural catheter at the end of the procedure found that patients were discharged after a median of two days and had the catheter removed after a median of 10 days and only four of 29 patients had a recurrence of pleural effusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h4\">Pleurectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radical total or subtotal pleurectomy (resection of visceral and parietal pleura) and decortication (removal of fibrous pleural rind) can control malignant pleural effusions in patients who have failed chemical pleurodesis.

In general, we prefer using an indwelling pleural catheter, rather than a pleuroperitoneal shunt, due to the frequency of shunt-related problems and the less invasive nature of indwelling pleural catheters. Pleuroperitoneal shunting, however, may have nutritional advantages for patients with malignant chylothorax and high volumes of pleural fluid drainage because shunting of nutrient-rich chyle to the peritoneal space allows its reabsorption. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-chylothorax\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis of chylothorax&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Indwelling pleural catheter'</a> above.)</p><p>Usually, the procedure is performed during thoracoscopy and under general anesthesia but may be placed by interventional radiological techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. The shunt catheter (Denver pleuroperitoneal shunt), has one or two one-way valves that allow unidirectional flow from the pleural space and is inserted with one end in the pleural cavity and the other through a subcutaneous tunnel into the peritoneum; the shunt pumping chamber is placed in a subcutaneous pocket overlying the costal margin.</p><p>In the hands of experienced operators, placement of a pleuroperitoneal shunt is reasonably safe, although shunt-related complications occur in about 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. The major problems have been shunt failure, most commonly due to occlusion of the catheter and infection. In a retrospective review of 160 patients who received a pleuroperitoneal shunt for MPE, 12 developed shunt occlusion (requiring revision in 5 and replacement in 7); another 7 developed infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].

Some of the factors that guide the choice of an approach include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indwelling pleural catheters require little if any time in the hospital; however, there is more inconvenience related to the longer dwell time of the tube and slightly greater risk of cellulitis at the insertion site. In addition, the patient or a family member needs to be able to perform intermittent drainage at home. This option is ideal for patients with a shorter anticipated duration of survival (less than six months), for patients who prefer outpatient management and a less invasive intervention, and for patients who have failed other modalities for pleurodesis.
