As an example, the plasma growth hormone concentration is commonly elevated in chronic kidney disease due to the interplay of several factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Decreased renal clearance appears to play a major role in the genesis of this problem since filtered growth hormone is normally reabsorbed in and metabolized by the proximal tubule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Enhanced growth hormone secretion also may contribute to the rise in plasma levels, although it is likely to be of lesser importance. Children with end-stage renal disease have an increase in the number of secretory bursts of growth hormone when compared with children with normal renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Why this occurs is not clear, but protein-calorie malnutrition and stress may play a role.</p><p>Plasma growth hormone levels fall to low-normal values after the institution of maintenance dialysis, an effect that may be mediated in part by acetate (which has now been largely replaced by bicarbonate) in the dialysis bath [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. For reasons that are not well understood, the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin also leads to a reduction in the basal concentration of growth hormone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">REGULATION OF GROWTH HORMONE RELEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of observations suggest that the hypothalamic-pituitary regulation of growth hormone is perturbed in chronic kidney disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. As an example, normal individuals suppress growth hormone release in response to induced hyperglycemia; in contrast, glucose induces a paradoxical rise in growth hormone levels in advanced renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In addition, insulin-induced hypoglycemia, which is a potent stimulus to growth hormone release in normal subjects, elicits a blunted response in chronic kidney disease patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The response to factors other than glucose also may be altered. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulates growth hormone release in uremic patients but has little or no effect in normals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This abnormal response can be abolished with either acute or chronic administration of erythropoietin&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>].</p><p>The factors responsible for the abnormal growth hormone regulation in chronic kidney disease are incompletely understood. Impaired hypothalamic control appears to be of primary importance. Uremic rats, in comparison to controls, have a normal growth hormone secretory response to growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, hypothalamic GHRH mRNA levels are reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL IMPORTANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physiologic significance of elevated growth hormone levels in chronic kidney disease is not clear. Although early studies suggested an etiologic link to the glucose intolerance that is commonly present in this setting, abnormal carbohydrate metabolism appears to be independent of growth hormone secretion. As an example, hemodialysis improves carbohydrate handling without correcting the increased plasma growth hormone concentration.</p><p>The relationship between altered growth hormone metabolism and growth retardation in children with chronic kidney disease has also received a great deal of interest. Since circulating growth hormone levels are elevated, it has been suggested that uremic individuals may have end-organ resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This hypothesis is supported by the observations in uremic rats that the number of growth hormone receptors, hepatic growth hormone receptor mRNA, and chondrocyte responsiveness to growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) are reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. Both decreased nutritional intake (which is common in advancing renal failure) and a circulating factor appear to contribute to the decrease in growth hormone receptor density. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-treatment-of-malnutrition-in-maintenance-hemodialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and treatment of malnutrition in maintenance hemodialysis patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The plasma concentration of growth hormone-binding protein is also increased in renal failure. Growth hormone-binding protein may contribute to growth hormone resistance by effectively competing with the receptor for ligand binding since it contains identical amino acid sequences to those in the receptor's extracellular binding domain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Growth hormone-binding protein may in fact arise by proteolytic cleavage of the growth hormone receptor.</p><p>In order to document that there is direct end-organ resistance to both growth hormone and IGF-1 that is independent of circulating inhibitors, one study compared the growth response of epiphyseal chondrocytes isolated from chronic kidney disease and control rats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In this study, chondrocytes from rats with chronic kidney disease that were grown in normal rat serum, fetal calf serum, or serum-free conditions all demonstrated a reduced growth response. The resistance was specific for the growth <span class=\"nowrap\">hormone/IGF</span> system since other cytokines such as fibroblast growth factor and transforming growth factor-beta elicited growth responses comparable with that seen in control cells.</p><p>In animal models of renal failure, growth hormone resistance can be partially overcome by the administration of large doses of recombinant growth hormone. In this setting, there is an elevation in the plasma level of IGF-1, improved growth, and an increase in the width of the tibial epiphyseal growth plate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/16,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18,19</a>]. The last effect is preferentially localized to the more mature chondrocytes in the hypertrophic zone instead of the immature chondrocytes in the proliferating zone. An increase in the abundance of IGF-1 mRNA is seen in both zones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>These results are consistent with the observation that administration of recombinant IGF-1 also stimulates growth in an animal model of renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The growth-promoting effects of recombinant growth hormone and recombinant IGF-1 are additive when they are given together [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>An increasing number of studies in children with renal insufficiency suggest that a similar response occurs in humans as supraphysiologic doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recombinant-human-growth-hormone-somatropin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">recombinant human growth hormone</a> can lead to increased growth that may allow attainment of normal adult height [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=growth-hormone-treatment-in-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease-and-postrenal-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Growth hormone treatment in children with chronic kidney disease and postrenal transplantation&quot;</a>). In addition, treatment of children with recombinant growth hormone appears to be safe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Studies to date have shown no evidence of increased risk of malignancy, accelerated loss of residual renal function, or worsening of metabolic bone disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Somatomedins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Somatomedins are thought to mediate the actions of growth hormone on skeletal tissue; as a result, a number of studies have examined their role in explaining the growth failure of chronic kidney disease. The somatomedins are a family of growth hormone-dependent IGFs that circulate in plasma in association with specific binding proteins. The steady-state levels of IGF-1 mRNA are diminished in the uremic state and fail to rise significantly after the administration of exogenous growth hormone due a defect at the transcriptional level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Decreased caloric intake and the metabolic acidosis associated with chronic kidney disease also may contribute to the peripheral growth hormone resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/14,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,23,24</a>]. As an example, experimental studies have demonstrated that metabolic acidosis (without renal failure) reduces both hepatic <em>IGF1</em> gene expression and hepatic mRNA for the growth hormone receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Despite the reduction in synthesis, plasma somatomedin levels (measured by radioimmunoassay) are usually normal or elevated in uremic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In particular, IGF-2 levels may be increased by as much as fourfold due primarily to decreased renal clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. When measured by bioassay, however, circulating somatomedin activity has typically been low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The apparent discrepancy between this observation and the normal plasma levels by radioimmunoassay appears to reflect the accumulation of a circulating peptide inhibitor that is normally cleared by the kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. As mentioned previously, there is also direct end-organ resistance to the effects of IGF-1 independent of circulating inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/15,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,29</a>].</p><p>In addition, quantitative and qualitative abnormalities in the IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) may contribute to the decreased bioactivity of IGF-1. Plasma levels of IGFBP-1, IGFBP-2, IGFBP-4, and IGFBP-6 are increased two- to threefold in advanced renal failure, while the concentration of IGFBP-3, the most abundant circulating IGFBP, is typically normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. However, some of the IGFBP-3 may be qualitatively abnormal due to accumulation of unsaturated low-molecular-weight forms of this protein, which may in turn lead to a decrease in bioactive IGF-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>The extent to which abnormal somatomedin metabolism contributes to disturbed growth in uremia remains to be established.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H547117529\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progression to end-stage renal disease is associated with a variety of abnormalities in growth hormone regulation, including increases in plasma concentration and decreases in end-organ responsiveness.
