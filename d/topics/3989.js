The yersinioses are zoonotic infections of domestic and wild animals; humans are considered incidental hosts that do not contribute to the natural disease cycle. </p><p><em>Y. pestis</em> causes plague and is transmitted by fleas. The most common clinical manifestation is acute febrile lymphadenitis, called bubonic plague. Less common forms include septicemia, pneumonia, pharyngeal, and meningeal plague.</p><p>The clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of plague will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, microbiology, and pathogenesis of <em>Y. pestis</em> are discussed separately.

Humans acquire plague via bites of rodent fleas, scratches or bites from infected domestic cats, direct handling of infected animal tissues, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected animals, inhalation of aerosolized droplets from infected humans, consumption of contaminated food, or by laboratory exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-plague-yersinia-pestis-infection/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. The incubation period is generally two to eight days. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-plague-yersinia-pestis-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, microbiology and pathogenesis of plague (Yersinia pestis infection)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are three major clinical syndromes associated with plague: bubonic plague, septicemic plague, and pneumonic plague [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-plague-yersinia-pestis-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Bubonic plague accounts for 80 to 95 percent of cases; septicemic plague accounts for 10 to 20 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-plague-yersinia-pestis-infection/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>]. Pneumonic plague is generally rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-plague-yersinia-pestis-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Overall, the estimated mortality is 60 to 100 percent in untreated plague compared with less than 15 percent with treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-plague-yersinia-pestis-infection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In a series of 23 cases of plague in the United States between 1977 and 1998, 17 were bubonic plague and the mortality rate was 22 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-plague-yersinia-pestis-infection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Bubonic plague</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bubonic plague is the most common form of plague; it accounts for 80 to 95 percent of cases. Skin lesions at the site of flea bite are usually inapparent and thus ignored or forgotten. However some patients may have eschars, pustules, or even necrotic lesions resembling ecthyma gangrenosum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-plague-yersinia-pestis-infection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Flea bites on the extremities may be associated with lymph nodes swellings in the region draining the inoculation site. A minority of patients develop skin lesions, such as purpura, associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-plague-yersinia-pestis-infection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Bubonic plague is clinically characterized by the sudden onset of fever, chills, weakness, and headache, followed by intense pain and swelling in a lymph node bearing area (bubo), which may be preceded by lymphadenopathy. Acute buboes are painful but lack fluctuation. They are often associated with erythema and edema of the overlying skin. The inguinal region is the most frequently involved site (the word &quot;bubo&quot; derives from the Greek word for &quot;groin&quot;); axillary or cervical regions may also be involved (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F52633\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52633 \">picture 1</a>). Axillary, cervical, or epitrochlear buboes may occur in patients with bubonic plague associated with cat exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-plague-yersinia-pestis-infection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>In the absence of treatment, the initial bubonic stage may be followed by disseminated infection (sepsis) in approximately 50 percent of untreated cases, which can lead to complications, such as pneumonia (secondary pneumonic plague) and meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-plague-yersinia-pestis-infection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Bacteremic patients may develop signs of septic shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-plague-yersinia-pestis-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Septicemic plague</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Septicemic plague that occurs without a preceding bubo accounts for 10 to 20 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-plague-yersinia-pestis-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The septicemic form of plague may be particularly difficult to diagnose in a timely manner if characteristic clinical clues, such as a bubo, are not present. Patients with septicemic plague are febrile and extremely ill but may not have localizing signs or symptoms. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain, may be observed. Hypotension, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and multiorgan failure develop in the later stages of the illness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Pneumonic plague</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pneumonic plague can be primary or secondary. Primary pneumonic plague can be acquired by inhalation of respiratory secretions or aerosolized droplets from infected animals or humans, or by laboratory exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-plague-yersinia-pestis-infection/abstract/2-4,11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4,11,13</a>]. Secondary pneumonic plague is more common and arises via hematogenous spread of bacteria from a bubo or other source. </p><p>Primary pneumonic plague has a short incubation period, ranging from a few hours to a few days. Affected patients typically present with the sudden onset of dyspnea, high fever, pleuritic chest pain, and cough that may be accompanied by characteristic bloody sputum. Pneumonic plague is rapidly fatal unless an appropriate antimicrobial agent is begun within the first day of illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-plague-yersinia-pestis-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>Secondary pneumonic plague develops in approximately 10 percent of patients with plague in the United States, usually as a result of delayed treatment of bubonic infection. The manifestations are as described above for primary pneumonic plague.</p><p>Human-to-human transmission of plague via aerosols remains a source of controversy. In one study of an outbreak in Madagascar, 8 percent of 154 contacts became infected with <em>Y. pestis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-plague-yersinia-pestis-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, in a study of cases of plague from an outbreak in Uganda, transmission was observed only in very close contacts (caregivers) and in the patients last days of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-plague-yersinia-pestis-infection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Treatment of patients and prophylaxis of contacts stopped the outbreak in Madagascar cited above. The capacity for spread via aerosolization makes <em>Y. pestis</em> a potential bioterrorism agent. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=identifying-and-managing-casualties-of-biological-terrorism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Identifying and managing casualties of biological terrorism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Other manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Meningitis can occur in conjunction with any of the three forms of plague, or it may occur as a &quot;primary&quot; meningeal infection presumably the result of occult bacteremic seeding of the central nervous system. Symptoms tend to be similar to other bacterial meningitides. Cerebrospinal fluid examination typically reveals a low glucose concentration, increased protein concentration, and a neutrophilic pleocytosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other manifestations of plague include pharyngitis and tonsillitis associated with anterior cervical lymphadenitis, following ingestion of <em>Y. pestis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-plague-yersinia-pestis-infection/abstract/3,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,11</a>]. Asymptomatic transient pharyngeal carriage of <em>Y. pestis</em> has been described in healthy contacts of bubonic plague cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-plague-yersinia-pestis-infection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. One small series described involvement of the urinary tract or gastrointestinal tract in 14 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-plague-yersinia-pestis-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Patients who develop plague without a bubo are often difficult to diagnose particularly when they occur as sporadic cases in the absence of a recognized outbreak. Such patients may develop manifestations of multiple organ dysfunction and die prior to or in spite of a recognized antemortem diagnosis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2491475\"><span class=\"h2\">Routine clinical studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine laboratory and radiographic studies do not provide findings specific for plague. White blood cell counts may vary from 3000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">100,000/microL,</span> but white cell counts <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;20,000/microL</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thrombocytopenia are present in approximately one-half of all cases. The combination of white cell counts &gt;20,000 and thrombocytopenia is a useful diagnostic clue for the recognition of plague in endemic areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-plague-yersinia-pestis-infection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The radiographic appearance of pneumonic plague is not sufficiently specific to be diagnostic. Chest radiography may demonstrate bronchopneumonia, consolidation, cavities, or pleural effusions. Unlike other more common bacterial pneumonias, hilar or mediastinal adenopathy are sometimes seen in patients with plague pneumonia, and this finding may provide one clue to the presence of this unusual pathogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-plague-yersinia-pestis-infection/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The sputum may initially be clear, but it is more typically purulent, or hemorrhagic, and it usually contains gram-negative rods when Gram stains are done.</p><p>The differential diagnosis of plague pneumonia includes other acute bacterial, fungal, or mycobacterial pneumonias. Hantavirus infections should be included in the differential diagnosis in geographic areas where this virus is known to be endemic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H276307205\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical suspicion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A high index of suspicion must be maintained in order to make a timely diagnosis of plague. Patients with fever and painful lymphadenopathy should be questioned about travel to areas of endemic disease, including the southwestern United States. In addition, animal or rodent vector contact within the preceding 10 days may provide clues that raise suspicion for a diagnosis of plague. The diagnosis of plague is established by isolation of the organism in culture or by serologic testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-plague-yersinia-pestis-infection/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Occasionally, patients with plague may be coinfected with malaria leading to diagnostic confusion in areas where malaria is endemic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-plague-yersinia-pestis-infection/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Three important diagnostic clues to the presence of plague include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-plague-yersinia-pestis-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of fever in a person with either known contact with dead rodents or residence or travel to a plague-endemic region.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of fever, hypotension, and unexplained regional lymphadenitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of clinical findings of pneumonia in association with hemoptysis and sputum containing gram-negative rods on Gram&rsquo;s stain.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Culture and staining</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Yersinia</em> grows well on common laboratory media. Microbiology personnel should be informed of any specimen suspected to harbor the organism so that they may exercise proper precautions to prevent laboratory acquisition of infection.</p><p>Blood cultures may be positive in 27 to 96 percent of patients, depending on the form of their clinical presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-plague-yersinia-pestis-infection/abstract/4,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,11</a>]. <em>Y. pestis</em> can also be cultured from sputum, cerebrospinal fluid, or pus aspirated from buboes. In one study, cultures of bubo aspirates were positive in 10 of 13 cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-plague-yersinia-pestis-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Aspiration of the bubo after injection with saline may be necessary to obtain an adequate specimen.</p><p>Examination of a peripheral blood specimen with Wright-Giemsa stain demonstrates rod-shaped organisms in up to 40 percent of cases. Microscopy evaluation of a bubo aspirate may also demonstrate the organism. Wayson's stain may demonstrate the typical bipolar staining, which resembles a &quot;closed safety pin&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F81633\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81633 \">picture 2</a>). Gram stain shows small gram-negative coccobacilli. Fluorescent antibody is also useful if available. </p><p>Automated bacterial identification systems may not be sufficiently accurate in identifying <em>Y. pestis</em> in a specimen culture, as illustrated by reports of misclassification as <em>Pseudomonas luteola</em>, <em>Acinetobacter lwoffi</em>, and <em>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-plague-yersinia-pestis-infection/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Thus, in a patient with symptoms consistent with plague or microbiologic findings of an organism with bipolar staining, the possibility of <em>Y. pestis</em> should not be discounted if these other organisms are detected by such systems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Serology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serologic confirmation requires acute and convalescent serum, looking for at least a fourfold rise in antibody titers to the F-1 antigen of <em>Y. pestis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-plague-yersinia-pestis-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A single titer of &gt;1:16 using the passive hemagglutination test is suggestive of the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-plague-yersinia-pestis-infection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Rapid tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A rapid diagnostic test capable of detecting 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> of the <em>Y. pestis</em> F1 antigen in the sputum or serum within 15 minutes has been developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-plague-yersinia-pestis-infection/abstract/7,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,21</a>]. In field testing in Madagascar, this assay had 100 percent sensitivity and specificity for <em>Y. pestis</em>, other <em>Yersinia</em> spp, and other bacteria; positive and negative predictive values were 91 and 87 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-plague-yersinia-pestis-infection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>Presumptive identification of <em>Y. pestis</em> can be made by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-plague-yersinia-pestis-infection/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. PCR testing has been used to detect <em>Y. pestis</em> in teeth of skeletons that are hundreds of years old, and whole genome sequencing of <em>Y. pestis</em> has been accomplished using specimens from victims of the Black Death who died in the Middle Ages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-plague-yersinia-pestis-infection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>An experimental method of rapid detection and simultaneous antibiotic susceptibility testing is based upon a genetically engineered &quot;light-tagged&quot; reporter phage that preferentially infects <em>Y. pestis</em> and, in doing so, creates a bioluminescent signal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-plague-yersinia-pestis-infection/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Because non-pestis strains of <em>Yersinia</em> and a few species of Enterobacteriaceae also may produce bioluminescence, albeit at an attenuated level, the potential for false positive tests would require use of additional confirmatory tests such as the <em>Y. pestis</em> F1 antigen. However, thus far, organisms likely to produce a plague-like illness, such as <em>Francisella tularensis</em>, <em>Bacillus anthracis</em>, and <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em>, do not appear to produce false positive tests with this method. Thus, the use of reporter phages for detection of <em>Y. pestis</em> may have utility in patients with pneumonic plague or in circumstances in which bioterrorism is suspected. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Appropriate and timely therapy can markedly improve patient outcomes, and chemoprophylaxis can prevent spread.

Pneumonic plague has a mortality rate of 100 percent if untreated (50 percent if treated) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-plague-yersinia-pestis-infection/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotic regimens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aminoglycosides are the preferred agents for plague, with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a> as alternatives.

Bubonic plague is characterized by the sudden onset of fever, chills, weakness, and headache, followed by intense pain and swelling in a lymph node bearing area (bubo), which may be preceded by lymphadenopathy. The acute bubo is characterized by exquisite tenderness without fluctuation, often associated with erythema and edema of the overlying skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F52633\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52633 \">picture 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Bubonic plague'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Septicemic plague without a preceding bubo accounts for 10 to 20 percent of plague cases. Patients with septicemic plague are febrile and extremely ill but do not have localizing signs or symptoms. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, may be observed. Hypotension, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and multiorgan failure develop in the later stages of the illness. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Septicemic plague'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pneumonic plague is generally rare; the mortality rate is 100 percent if untreated (50 percent if treated). Pneumonic plague can be primary (eg, acquired by inhalation of respiratory secretions or aerosolized droplets from infected animals or humans or by laboratory exposure) or secondary (eg, developing in the setting of bubonic or septicemic plague). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Pneumonic plague'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of plague is established by isolation of the organism in culture, by serologic testing or by rapid testing in appropriate settings. A high index of suspicion must be maintained for the timely diagnosis of plague. Patients with fever and painful lymphadenopathy should be questioned about travel to areas of endemic disease. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=streptomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">streptomycin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> for treatment of plague (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Doxycycline</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a> are acceptable alternative agents for patients who cannot tolerate aminoglycosides.
