It is a functional definition, implying a significant amount of malabsorption of both macronutrients and micronutrients and is not necessarily dependent on the loss of bowel or a particular length of bowel. Patients with SBS are at risk for several complications. These complications may result from the underlying disease, altered bowel anatomy and physiology, or its treatment, including the need for parenteral nutrition and the use of a central venous catheter. Acute complications that can occur at any time include watery diarrhea, electrolyte disturbances, and catheter-related complications. </p><p>This topic will review the chronic complications of SBS in adults. The pathophysiology and management of SBS, including small bowel transplantation, are discussed separately. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H323101519\"><span class=\"h1\">ESOPHAGITIS/PEPTIC ULCER DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastric hypersecretion is common after SBS and may last 6 to 12 months postoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-the-short-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In a minority of cases, gastric hypersecretion may lead to esophagitis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> peptic ulcer disease and patients may present with symptoms of heartburn, regurgitation, dysphagia, or abdominal pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-short-bowel-syndrome#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of short bowel syndrome&quot;, section on 'Ileal versus jejunal adaptation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peptic-ulcer-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peptic ulcer disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Gastric hypersecretion is thought to occur as a result of the loss of inhibitory hormones produced in the proximal gut (eg, gastric inhibitory peptide and vasoactive intestinal peptide). The volume of secretions entering the small bowel increases and the pH of the secretions in the proximal gut is lowered, aggravating fluid losses and leading to peptic complications and impairment in the function of pancreatic exocrine secretions, further contributing to fat maldigestion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-short-bowel-syndrome#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of short bowel syndrome&quot;, section on 'Ileal versus jejunal adaptation'</a>.)</p><p>Antisecretory medications (eg, proton pump inhibitors or histamine 2-receptor antagonists) used in the early postoperative period in patients with SBS reduce gastric secretions, improve digestion and absorption, and can prevent peptic complications. In patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease or peptic ulcer disease, acid-suppressing medications are used to treat symptoms. However, acid-suppressing medications should be weaned or used at the lowest possible dose in patients with SBS as long-term use is associated with an increased risk of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and other side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-the-short-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Diarrhea can result from a reduction of absorptive surface area; decrease in intestinal transit time; humorally mediated gastric, small intestinal, and colonic hypersecretion; impairment in the function of pancreatic exocrine secretions, leading to fat maldigestion; or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-the-short-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1148337816\"><span class=\"h2\">Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth can present with bloating, flatulence, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, or steatorrhea. Symptoms of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth can lead to a reduction in oral intake and, in turn, delay weaning of parenteral nutrition.

This limits the efficacy of peristalsis in ridding the small intestine of bacteria. Other contributing factors include the absence of an ileocecal valve to prevent reflux of bacteria into the small intestine, compromised enterocyte turnover due to suboptimal enteral nutrient stimulation, and the use of acid-suppressive medications.

If small bowel aspirate is not available, a presumptive diagnosis is made in patients with SBS and bloating, flatulence, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, or steatorrhea. Hydrogen breath tests should not be used to diagnose small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in patients with SBS as rapid transit in the shortened bowel makes it difficult to differentiate small bowel versus colonic hydrogen production. The diagnosis of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is discussed separately.

The continuous use of low-dose antibiotics in SBS may be necessary in some patients. To reduce the risk of antibiotic resistance, antibiotics should be periodically rotated. Other strategies for controlling bacterial overgrowth include limiting the use of antisecretory and antimotility agents and intermittent bowel flushing with polyethylene glycol. Although the use of surgical bowel tapering has been reported, there are insufficient data to recommend them for management of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in patients with SBS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-the-short-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

While steatosis is more commonly seen in adults, cholestasis occurs more commonly in children. In adults, the risk of liver disease is related to age, length of time on parenteral nutrition, total caloric intake, and parenteral lipids or glucose overload. Most patients are asymptomatic but may have elevations in hepatic aminotransferases. Severe steatosis and cholestasis can progress to end-stage liver disease. Cholestatic liver dysfunction may lead to cirrhosis and portal hypertension and is an indication for combined <span class=\"nowrap\">liver/intestine</span> transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-the-short-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Life-threatening liver disease caused by parenteral nutrition is rare, particularly in adults. However, when it occurs, it is most often due to sepsis, drug toxicity, and, possibly, bacterial overgrowth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-the-short-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

In patients with small intestine bacterial overgrowth, the bacteria compete for vitamin B12 and contribute to the deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency is characterized by a macrocytic anemia and can lead to neurologic dysfunction (dementia or weakness, sensory ataxia, and paresthesias). Patients with SBS and vitamin B12 deficiency require nasal or parenteral administration.

Hypomagnesemia occurs as a consequence of secondary hyperaldosteronism that results from the loss of magnesium-absorbing gut, the binding of magnesium by unabsorbed fatty acids, and <span class=\"nowrap\">sodium/water</span> depletion that increases urinary magnesium losses. Hypomagnesemia may lead to hypocalcemia as a result of impaired parathyroid hormone release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-the-short-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

However, higher doses are frequently needed and may be difficult to use because they worsen diarrhea. Magnesium heptogluconate is especially useful in correcting hypomagnesemia without diarrhea and is available as a liquid that can be added to oral rehydration therapy. The correction of sodium depletion is critical in treating hypomagnesemia. The oral administration of 1-alpha-hydroxycholecalciferol increases both intestinal absorption and renal absorption of magnesium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-the-short-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

In patients with SBS with fat malabsorption and a colon in continuity, calcium binds to unabsorbed fatty acids, leaving oxalate free to pass into the colon to be absorbed and then filtered by the kidney. In the kidney, oxalate binds to calcium, resulting in oxalate nephrolithiasis and progressive obstructive nephropathy. Increased colonic permeability to small molecules such as oxalate induced by nonabsorbed bile acids facilitates oxalate entry into the bloodstream. A reduction in bacterial breakdown of oxalate due to decreased <em>Oxalobacter formigenes </em>also leads to increased absorption of oxalate in patients with SBS. The diarrheal fluid losses can lead to a reduction in urine volume and, in patients with metabolic acidosis, a low urine pH and a marked decrease in citrate excretion can promote uric acid as well as calcium oxalate stone formation.

The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of D-lactic acidosis are discussed separately.

The prevention, diagnosis, and management of catheter-related complications are discussed in detail, separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-parenteral-nutrition#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition support in critically ill patients: Parenteral nutrition&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of intravascular catheter-related infections&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of intravascular catheter-related infections&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of intravascular catheter-related infections&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antibiotic-lock-therapy-for-treatment-of-catheter-related-bloodstream-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antibiotic lock therapy for treatment of catheter-related bloodstream infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic complications of short bowel syndrome (SBS) may result from the underlying disease, altered bowel anatomy and physiology, or its treatment, including the need for parenteral nutrition and the use of a central venous catheter. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastric hypersecretion is common after SBS and may last 6 to 12 months postoperatively. In a minority of cases, gastric hypersecretion may lead to esophagitis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> peptic ulcer disease and patients may present with symptoms of heartburn, regurgitation, and dysphagia or abdominal pain. Acid-suppressing medications should be used at the lowest possible dose in patients with SBS as long-term use is associated with an increased risk of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and other side effects. (See <a href=\"#H323101519\" class=\"local\">'Esophagitis/peptic ulcer disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1148337816\" class=\"local\">'Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with SBS who require long-term parenteral nutrition are at risk for the development of liver disease and cholelithiasis. Strategies for prevention of liver disease include adjusting parenteral nutrition to provide the minimum level of total energy and macronutrients required, cycling parenteral nutrition, aggressive use of enteral nutrition, treating small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and preventing and promptly treating catheter-related sepsis. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Hepatic steatosis and cholestasis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea can result from a reduction of absorptive surface area; decrease in intestinal transit time; humorally mediated gastric, small intestinal, and colonic hypersecretion; impairment in the function of pancreatic exocrine secretions, leading to fat maldigestion; or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. The diagnosis of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in patients with SBS is made with small bowel aspirate with quantitative bacterial cultures. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is managed with antibiotics and dietary manipulation to reduce the carbohydrate substrate available for bacterial metabolism. (See <a href=\"#H1148337666\" class=\"local\">'Diarrhea'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrolyte and micronutrient deficiencies are uncommon in short bowel patients who are receiving parenteral nutrition. However, patients with SBS are at greatest risk for nutrient deficiencies during and after the time that parenteral nutrition is discontinued. We measure vitamin and mineral levels semiannually in those receiving parenteral nutrition, at the time of parenteral nutrition discontinuation, followed by every three months for the first year, and then at least annually based on the requirements for supplementation. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Electrolyte and micronutrient deficiencies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with SBS are at risk for metabolic bone disease and can develop osteomalacia, osteoporosis, osteopenia, and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Specific risk factors for metabolic bone disease in patients with SBS include the effects of the parenteral nutrition, malabsorption of macro- and micronutrients (eg, vitamin D), electrolyte alterations (eg, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia), and chronic metabolic acidosis. We therefore screen for bone disease in patients with SBS with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at baseline and then every two years. (See <a href=\"#H262457694\" class=\"local\">'Metabolic bone disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with SBS and a colon in continuity with intestinal contents are at increased risk for oxaluria and nephrolithiasis. The management of patients with enteric hyperoxaluria is with a low-oxalate diet, high fluid intake, potassium citrate to correct metabolic acidosis if present, and oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-carbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium carbonate</a> to bind oxalate in the intestinal lumen. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Nephrolithiasis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>D-lactic acidosis is a rare neurologic syndrome characterized by altered mental status ranging from confusion to coma, slurred speech, seizures, and ataxia resulting from bacterial fermentation of unabsorbed carbohydrates. It primarily occurs in patients with an intact colon and often in the setting of underlying bacterial overgrowth. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'D-lactic acidosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1802719\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Jon Vanderhoof, MD, and Rosemary Pauley-Hunter, NP-C, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-the-short-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Williams NS, Evans P, King RF.
