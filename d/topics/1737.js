In some cases, there is involvement of the subglottic laryngeal structures, extension into the upper bronchial tree, or associated pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-tracheitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. Thus, &quot;acute bacterial laryngotracheobronchitis&quot; may be a more accurate clinical and anatomic description of this entity, but &quot;bacterial tracheitis&quot; is the preferred terminology in most textbooks and publications. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis and pathology'</a> below.)</p><p>Other terms that have been used to describe invasive exudative bacterial infection of soft tissues of the trachea include &quot;bacterial croup,&quot; &quot;membranous croup,&quot; &quot;pseudomembranous croup,&quot; &quot;acute laryngotracheobronchitis,&quot; and &quot;membranous laryngotracheobronchitis&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-tracheitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS AND PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The larynx of healthy individuals is often colonized with bacterial species common to the upper respiratory tract, some of which are potential pathogens (eg, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, gram-negative enteric bacteria, <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>). Such colonization can extend, at least transiently, into the trachea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-tracheitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Bacterial colonization of the trachea may be present within 24 hours after birth, even in infants born at &lt;31 weeks gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-tracheitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Bacterial tracheitis almost always occurs in the setting of prior airway mucosal damage, as occurs with antecedent viral infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-tracheitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>] (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Predisposing viruses'</a> below). Aspiration of bacteria-laden secretions into the trachea during bacterial infection of the upper respiratory tract (eg, acute bacterial sinusitis, streptococcal pharyngitis) or after tonsillectomy also may lead to bacterial tracheitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-tracheitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11</a>].</p><p>Extension of tracheal infection into the bloodstream is uncommon, as blood cultures are rarely positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-tracheitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6,9,12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9,12-14</a>].</p><p>Pathologic findings vary depending upon the combination of specific predisposing virus and bacterial etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-tracheitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Autopsy examinations have noted severe subglottic obstruction caused by edema, necrotic debris, and purulent secretions. The tracheal mucosa is edematous and hyperemic. Patches of mucosa may be necrotic or sloughed. Cellular infiltrates of mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells are present in the mucosa and submucosa. Microabscesses may be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-tracheitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The true incidence of bacterial tracheitis is not known, but it appears to be rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-tracheitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The estimated incidence was 0.1 cases per 100,000 children per year in a multicenter review that identified 34 cases between 1993 and 2007 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-tracheitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Nonetheless, bacterial tracheitis is among the most frequent pediatric airway emergencies requiring admission to an intensive care unit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-tracheitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,20</a>].</p><p>Bacterial tracheitis generally occurs during the first six years of life (mean age in a systematic review of 300 cases ranged from 10 to 75 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-tracheitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, it has been reported in infants as young as one month, adolescents, and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-tracheitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. There is a slight male predominance (male-to-female ratio of 1.3:1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-tracheitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>The majority of cases of bacterial tracheitis occur in previously healthy children in the setting of a viral respiratory tract infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-tracheitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Bacterial tracheitis occurred as a complication in 21 (0.3 percent) of 6769 children &lt;18 years old who were hospitalized with influenza infection from 2003 to 2010 in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-tracheitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>The majority of cases occur in the fall and winter, coinciding with the typical seasonal epidemics of parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and seasonal influenza [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-tracheitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,4,9,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,9,19</a>].
