In a systematic review of 22,225 cases of primary hyperparathyroidism reported between 1995 and 2003, parathyroid carcinoma accounted for 0.74 percent of the cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-carcinoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In a retrospective study of two European cohorts of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, the frequency of parathyroid carcinoma ranged from 0.3 to 2.1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-carcinoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>From 1988 to 2003, 224 patients with parathyroid carcinoma were identified by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-carcinoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. During this time period, the incidence of parathyroid carcinoma increased from 3.58 to 5.73 per 10 million population. The increase was accompanied by a significant decrease in the proportion of patients with large (&ge;4 cm) tumors and increase in proportion with negative lymph nodes, suggesting that earlier diagnosis may account for the increased incidence. From 2000 to 2012, the incidence rate for parathyroid carcinoma (SEER database) was 0.36, and there was a decrease in the incidence rate between 2000 to 2002 and 2010 to 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-carcinoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The occurrence of parathyroid carcinoma in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is very rare; only one case was reported in a series of 348 cases of MEN1 (0.28 percent) from the Mayo Clinic from 1977 to 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-carcinoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Studies have confirmed the presence of <em>HRPT2</em> mutations in both the hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome (HPT-JT) and sporadic parathyroid carcinoma, as well as their rare presence in isolated familial hyperparathyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-carcinoma/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>HPT-JT</strong> &ndash; Inactivating germline mutations in the <em>HRPT2</em> gene are responsible for an autosomal dominant type of familial hyperparathyroidism, HPT-JT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-carcinoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Patients with HPT-JT are predisposed to ossifying fibromas of the jaw, cystic and neoplastic renal lesions, uterine tumors, and parathyroid neoplasia with an increased risk of parathyroid cancer. Parathyroid carcinoma was reported to occur in approximately 15 percent of patients with HPT-JT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-carcinoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In HPT-JT, all parathyroid glands are at risk for tumor development, but the tumors can occur asynchronously over many years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sporadic parathyroid carcinoma</strong> &ndash; Sporadic (nonfamilial) parathyroid carcinomas frequently bear <em>HRPT2</em> mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-carcinoma/abstract/8,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11,12</a>]. One of two original studies reported <em>HRPT2</em> mutations in 10 of 15 sporadic parathyroid cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-carcinoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], and the other identified such mutations in four of four carcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-carcinoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Most mutations were somatic and clonal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-carcinoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], implying a selective advantage that attests to their pathogenetic importance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Unsuspected germline mutations were also discovered in a substantial minority of patients who presented clinically with sporadic parathyroid carcinoma, suggesting that some of these individuals may have HPT-JT or a phenotypic variant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-carcinoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This recognition that family members of some patients with apparently sporadic parathyroid cancer are also at risk for this malignancy has created a new indication for genetic testing. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Genetic testing'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In sporadic parathyroid cancer, combining results from three studies resulted in an impressive prevalence of 77 percent (20 of 26) for coding region mutations in <em>HRPT2</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-carcinoma/abstract/8,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11,12</a>]. Conversely, in the largest series of sporadic benign parathyroid adenomas reported to date, no intragenic mutations of the <em>HRPT2</em> gene could be detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-carcinoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Combining the latter study with one or more of the previous ones, depending upon criteria used to select the tumors, would lead to a prevalence as low as 0 percent (0 of 85) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-carcinoma/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>] or as high as 1.8 percent (3 of 167) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-carcinoma/abstract/8,9,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,12,13</a>] for <em>HRPT2</em> mutations in parathyroid adenomas.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The above cumulative analyses provide evidence that <em>HRPT2</em> intragenic mutations are very highly specific to rigorously defined parathyroid carcinomas, as opposed to typical sporadic adenomas, and should be investigated as a potentially useful diagnostic tool in (non-HPT-JT-related) atypical parathyroid neoplasms that lack the classical invasive or metastatic features of carcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-carcinoma/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. The clinical utility of immunohistochemical detection of the parafibromin protein in distinguishing parathyroid carcinoma from atypical parathyroid adenomas is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-carcinoma/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H365951676\"><span class=\"h2\">Other genes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Application of whole exome sequencing and other next-generation sequencing methods have importantly expanded the landscape of genomic alterations in parathyroid carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-carcinoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Recurrent somatic driver mutations were found in several established cancer genes not previously implicated in this disease; notably, these include <span class=\"nowrap\">PI3K/AKT/MTOR</span> pathway alterations in more than 20 percent of cases and cyclin D1 amplification in almost 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-carcinoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A specific and novel recurrent mutation in putative kinase-encoding gene <em>ADCK1</em> was revealed (&lt;10 percent of cases), identifying it as a likely human oncogene.</p><p>These discoveries carry immediate clinical implications in demonstrating that some <span class=\"nowrap\">metastatic/surgically</span> incurable parathyroid cancers can carry tumor-specific mutations against which new targeted therapeutic agents may already exist. For example, the presence of a <em>PIK3CA</em> or <em>MTOR</em> mutation would suggest that treatment with new drugs, initially designed to target such mutations in other tumor types, could be effective in these selected parathyroid carcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-carcinoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2046792744\" class=\"local\">'Novel precision/molecularly targeted cancer therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Additional genes also appear to participate in the pathogenesis of parathyroid carcinoma, but their identities remain to be established. As an example, evidence has implicated abnormal expression of the retinoblastoma and p53 proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-carcinoma/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>], and a tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 13 in the vicinity of the retinoblastoma gene (<em>RB1</em>) may play a role in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-carcinoma/abstract/19,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21</a>]. In another report, somatic mutations in the <em>MEN1</em> gene were found in 3 of 23 sporadic parathyroid carcinoma cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-carcinoma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], although diagnostic criteria for carcinoma differed from other studies in not requiring local invasion or metastases. In general, this disease has not been considered to be part of the <em>MEN1</em>-associated phenotype, and the possible association requires further study. <em>MEN1</em> is reviewed in detail separately.

Whereas benign hyperparathyroidism is more common in women (3:1), the incidence of parathyroid cancer is equal between the two genders. Compared with patients with parathyroid adenomas, patients with parathyroid carcinomas are more likely to have symptoms, larger tumor size, bone and kidney disease, marked hypercalcemia, and very high serum PTH concentrations (5- to 10-fold higher than the upper limit of normal) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-carcinoma/abstract/16,23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,23-26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A retrospective study of 311 cases of primary hyperparathyroidism, of which nine were parathyroid carcinomas, demonstrated that PTH levels less than four times the upper limit of normal and a tumor weight &lt;1.9 g made the likelihood of parathyroid carcinoma essentially zero [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-carcinoma/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

Nonfunctioning parathyroid carcinomas are rare, with 32 cases reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-carcinoma/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. In a review of 17 such cases, patients were reported to be diagnosed at a more advanced stage of disease, and their tumors may be more aggressive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-carcinoma/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Frequent locations for metastases include the lungs, cervical lymph nodes, liver, and bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-carcinoma/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In contrast to patients with functional parathyroid cancers, patients with nonfunctional tumors die from mass effect and tumor burden rather than from hypercalcemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-carcinoma/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parathyroid carcinoma should be suspected in a patient with primary hyperparathyroidism who presents with parathyroid crisis (or marked hypercalcemia and very high parathyroid hormone [PTH] concentrations) or a neck mass. The diagnosis of parathyroid carcinoma is typically made at the time of surgery to correct severe hyperparathyroidism.</p><p>Although the classic pathologic features of a trabecular pattern, mitotic figures, thick fibrous bands, and capsular and vascular invasion, when present, are highly suggestive of parathyroid carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-carcinoma/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>], the two criteria upon which a more definitive diagnosis of parathyroid cancer can be made are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local invasion of contiguous structures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">or</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymph node or distant metastases</p><p/><p>Gross invasion beyond the capsule and including extracapsular vascular invasion appear to correlate best with cancer diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-carcinoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The use of an immunohistochemical panel that includes parafibromin, galactin-3, PGP9.5, and Ki67 has been suggested from a small series to aid in diagnosis of parathyroid carcinoma, with a sensitivity of 80 percent and specificity of 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-carcinoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Although preoperative localization studies help plan the operative approach in patients who have a biochemically confirmed diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism, they do not reliably distinguish parathyroid carcinoma from adenoma.

However, they acknowledge that available data on tumor characteristics and prognosis are so limited that proposing a staging system at this time would be premature.

If a parathyroid tumor appears to be well demarcated (not invading surrounding tissue) but is found on pathological examination to invade adjacent tissue, reoperation to remove all tumor tissue is recommended because there are no pathologic criteria that distinguish a carcinoma that will follow an indolent course from one with a more aggressive course.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Metastatic disease</strong> &ndash; Because nonsurgical therapies for parathyroid carcinoma have had disappointing results, surgical resection of distant metastases (bone and lung) has been performed in some circumstances, primarily to debulk tumor as palliation of the effects of hypercalcemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-carcinoma/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Recurrent disease</strong> &ndash; Patients with recurrent parathyroid carcinoma can also be treated surgically.

There is no role for <em>HRPT2</em> germline testing in patients with typical sporadic parathyroid adenomas.</p><p>Genetic diagnosis of a germline <em>HRPT2</em> inactivating mutation in a patient with sporadic parathyroid carcinoma indicates that such a patient may have classic HPT-JT, expressing its initial manifestation, or phenotypic variants, such as familial isolated hyperparathyroidism, or a form of HPT-JT with altered penetrance of the component features. Pending additional data on variant syndromes ascertained in this fashion, one must conservatively assume they carry a similar risk of parathyroid cancer (15 percent), as is found in classic HPT-JT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">What if the HRPT2 genetic test shows a mutation?</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Index patient</strong> &ndash; For the proband (index patient) with apparently sporadic parathyroid cancer, management of the existing malignancy would typically not be altered by genetic diagnosis of <em>HRPT2</em> mutation. However, this genetic diagnosis would mean that all parathyroid glands remain at increased risk for developing entirely new tumors, themselves potentially malignant. Thus, in several situations, such as recurrent hyperparathyroidism after seemingly successful surgery or worsened hypercalcemia in the face of apparently stable metastatic tumor burden, knowledge of an <em>HPRT2</em> mutation would caution against the assumption that the original tumor is entirely responsible and could focus surgical attention on previously normal parathyroids in the neck or mediastinum.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Family members</strong> &ndash; If the index patient proves to have a detectable germline mutation, then relatives at risk can be definitively tested (also less expensively) for the presence or absence of that specific mutation. One major benefit of testing is the reassurance provided to relatives who prove to have not inherited the mutation, diminishing anxiety as well as ongoing costs of disease surveillance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For relatives who did inherit the mutation, their heightened risk of parathyroid malignancy mandates careful clinical attention, beginning with immediate biochemical testing for primary hyperparathyroidism followed by surgery for those whose biochemical screen is suggestive or diagnostic of primary hyperparathyroidism. For individuals who carry the <em>HRPT2</em> mutation but have no evidence of hyperparathyroidism, a program of prospective surveillance is recommended. The optimal way to conduct such surveillance remains uncertain and will be informed by ongoing clinical experience, emerging data on disease penetrance, and available therapies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For now, we think a reasonable approach would be measurement of serum calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) every six months, maintaining a high level of suspicion in interpreting results and a low threshold for proceeding to parathyroid surgery. The sensitivity of such screening may be enhanced by use of ionized calcium measurements, while specificity may be enhanced by maintenance of adequate vitamin D status.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical approach for HRPT2 mutation carriers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the rarity of <em>HRPT2</em>-related disorders, the lack of controlled studies, and varying findings in different reports of surgical experience (each with small numbers of cases), there is no consensus on the optimal surgical approach for <em>HRPT2</em> mutation carriers. The optimal approach to initial parathyroid surgery in hyperparathyroid patients with known <em>HRPT2</em> mutation should take into account the substantial malignant potential, tempered by the expectation from classic HPT-JT that most tumors will still be benign, together with the increased risk of multiglandular disease, asynchrony in tumor development, and observations that tumors can occasionally be nonfunctional [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-carcinoma/abstract/34,36,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,36,68</a>].</p><p>We generally advise that bilateral exploration be performed, identifying all parathyroid glands. This advice is strongly dependent on the availability of a highly experienced parathyroid surgeon. Grossly abnormal or suspicious-appearing glands should be resected, bearing in mind the risk of malignancy. Resection itself should be selective, and it seems reasonable for the surgeon to leave in situ any normal-appearing glands, marking their location to facilitate possible future operations.</p><p>An alternative, more limited surgical approach has also been advocated, more akin to the type of focused exploration commonly performed for typical parathyroid adenomas. This approach might be expected to carry a lower risk of surgical complications compared with bilateral exploration, and it can be successful in that <em>HRPT2</em> mutation carriers may often have developed a tumor in only one gland at the time of initial parathyroidectomy. On the other hand, this latter approach runs the risk of missing tumors, including potentially aggressive lesions, in additional parathyroid glands that may have evaded detection with preoperative imaging and may also be nonfunctional or poorly functional [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-carcinoma/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parathyroid-surgery-for-inherited-syndromes#H22965827\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parathyroid surgery for inherited syndromes&quot;, section on 'HPT-JT'</a>.)</p><p>Total parathyroidectomy has been advocated by some clinicians for <em>HRPT2</em> mutation carriers with hyperparathyroidism, given that all their parathyroid tissues have increased malignant potential. Currently, we do not favor this approach, because of the considerable morbidity associated with management of lifelong hypoparathyroidism, the significant but nonoverwhelming penetrance of malignancy, and the expectation that prospective surveillance should identify tumors sufficiently early to prevent death from metastatic cancer.

Such families may still have occult <em>HRPT2</em> mutations that evade detection because only the coding region of the gene is generally sequenced, and inactivating mutations would be expected to occur in regulatory regions in some families.</p><p>Therefore, a negative test does not provide strong reassurance that the index patient with sporadic parathyroid carcinoma is <em>HRPT2</em> mutation free. Under these circumstances, the likelihood of a familial syndrome might gain clinical support by jaw, kidney, and uterine imaging. Overall, however, this uninformative genetic test result means that the patient and family may still be at risk for harboring an occult mutation and should be treated and followed accordingly. Genetic counseling to assess the diminished, but not negligible, level of risk may be especially helpful in this setting.</p><p>How does one approach the patient with sporadic carcinoma for whom genetic testing will not or cannot be done, perhaps because of expense or personal choice? Jaw and kidney imaging of the patient and family may provide helpful information, but all family members who might have inherited the proband's potentially mutant <em>HRPT2</em> allele would be considered to be at risk and in general be subjected to the surveillance as described above.

The addition or substitution of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cinacalcet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cinacalcet</a> has been reported to successfully control hypercalcemia in some patients. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Denosumab</a> is an option for patients who have hypercalcemia refractory to both bisphosphonates and cinacalcet.
