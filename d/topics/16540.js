It has also been used for other inflammatory joint disorders and for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).</p><p>Initial studies in the 1940s suggested a beneficial effect in patients with RA, but the drug's efficacy was challenged by the findings of a negative, small, open-label 1949 report, which was influential despite a flawed study design [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfasalazine-pharmacology-administration-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Additionally, the introduction of cortisone during this period, an event then hailed as a modern medical miracle, further dampened enthusiasm for the use of SSZ in RA. However, a resurgence of interest in SSZ as a therapeutic agent for rheumatic disorders occurred after beneficial results were reported in a trial performed in the late 1970s and in the first placebo-controlled trial in 1983, and it is widely available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfasalazine-pharmacology-administration-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>The pharmacology, dosing, and adverse effects of SSZ as used in the treatment of RA and other forms of inflammatory arthritis are discussed here.

Approximately 30 percent of orally administered SSZ, which therapeutically is a relatively inactive chemical, is rapidly absorbed by the small bowel and is then returned, largely unaltered, via the enterohepatic circulation into the bile. Thus, approximately 90 percent of the ingested drug reaches the large intestine as an intact molecule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfasalazine-pharmacology-administration-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7</a>].</p><p>In the colon, SSZ is reduced by the bacterial enzyme azoreductase to its two components, sulfapyridine and 5-ASA. Thus, coliform bacteria are necessary to reduce the relatively inactive parent drug to its active moieties. Nearly all of the sulfapyridine is absorbed, while 5-ASA is largely excreted in the feces, consistent with the utility of 5-ASA in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).</p><p>Sulfapyridine is subsequently metabolized in the liver via hydroxylation and acetylation. The half-life of these components is prolonged in slow acetylators, a property which may affect toxicity but not efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfasalazine-pharmacology-administration-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7</a>].</p><p>No major drug-drug interactions have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfasalazine-pharmacology-administration-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, in vitro studies demonstrated that SSZ can interfere with cellular uptake of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX), a folate analogue, by the reduced folate carrier (RFC), which transports both folates and MTX across the cell membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfasalazine-pharmacology-administration-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This does not appear to adversely affect the clinical efficacy of most combination regimens of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) that include SSZ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfasalazine-pharmacology-administration-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The combination of MTX and SSZ was found less effective than MTX combined with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a> (HCQ). This lack of an additive or synergistic effect may be due to inhibition by SSZ of MTX uptake at the RFC.</p><p>It has also been shown in in vitro studies that SSZ downregulates multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP)-1, a protein that exports <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloroquine</a> from the cell, resulting in higher intracellular levels of HCQ, which could explain the finding in clinical trials that the same inhibitory effect of SSZ on MTX cellular transport did not detract from the proven overall efficacy of MTX-SSZ-HCQ triple therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfasalazine-pharmacology-administration-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF ACTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies directly comparing the efficacy of sulfapyridine with 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) suggest that sulfapyridine is the active moiety in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), rather than 5-ASA, which is the active metabolite in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfasalazine-pharmacology-administration-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. The mechanism of action of sulfapyridine in RA has not been identified, and a positive effect due to the parent molecule alone cannot be entirely excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfasalazine-pharmacology-administration-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sulfasalazine</a> (SSZ) and sulfapyridine have antiinflammatory, immunosuppressive, and other effects.</p><p>Sulfapyridine, like SSZ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfasalazine-pharmacology-administration-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], may have disease-modifying effects as its administration in patients with RA is associated with decreases in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and serum concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfasalazine-pharmacology-administration-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. However, there is little interest in further study of sulfapyridine alone because of potential toxicity issues, and the parent molecule remains the well-established agent used therapeutically.</p><p>There are several plausible mechanisms of action. One is the inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa B (NFkB). This protein, which is also suppressed by glucocorticoids, induces the transcription of central mediators of the immune response. An in vitro study found that the administration of SSZ strongly inhibited NFkB-dependent transcription in colonic cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfasalazine-pharmacology-administration-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Interestingly, these actions were unique to SSZ and were not observed with sulfapyridine or 5-ASA, thereby suggesting that the parent molecule may have important antiinflammatory properties. SSZ may also inhibit osteoclast formation via modulatory effects on the receptor activator of NFkB (RANK), osteoprotegerin (OPG), and RANK-ligand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfasalazine-pharmacology-administration-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>In addition, SSZ can inhibit tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha expression via apoptosis of macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfasalazine-pharmacology-administration-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Sulfapyridine may reduce secretion of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfasalazine-pharmacology-administration-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Another study has suggested that SSZ and its metabolites preferentially suppress B-cell function but not T-cell function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfasalazine-pharmacology-administration-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>An additional mechanism that has been proposed is through increased production of adenosine at sites of inflammation, which has been suggested to be an antiinflammatory property of SSZ that it shares with another effective antirheumatic drug, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfasalazine-pharmacology-administration-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p>Since sulfapyridine is a sulfonamide, an antibacterial effect has been entertained; however, the observation that other sulfonamides are ineffective in RA makes this hypothesis unlikely. One 24-week study, for example, directly compared sulfapyridine (1.25 g per day) with cotrimoxazole (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a>, 480 mg three times daily) in patients with RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfasalazine-pharmacology-administration-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

We check the CBC one week after each dose increase (before the next dose adjustment). During the first three months of therapy and when the dose is increased, evaluation of CBC, liver transaminases, and creatinine levels should occur every two to four weeks. During the third through sixth months of therapy, levels should be monitored every 8 to 12 weeks, and, after six months, levels should be monitored every 12 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfasalazine-pharmacology-administration-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>The dose of SSZ can be lowered to 1500 or 1000 mg per day if the patient develops mild toxicity (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects'</a> below). The dose can be increased to a maximum of 3 g daily, usually in divided doses, in patients who fail to respond to 2 g daily and who are without significant side effects.</p><p>This approach to titration and monitoring is consistent with the 2008 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines for the use of nonbiologic and biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and with the 2012 and 2015 updates of these recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfasalazine-pharmacology-administration-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/31,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,33,34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ADVERSE EFFECTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adverse reactions, including idiosyncratic and dose-related effects, are common with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a> (SSZ); relatively common among these are gastrointestinal, central nervous system, cutaneous, and hematologic adverse effects.

Since the number of circulating neutrophils is usually much higher than the number of lymphocytes, most leukopenic patients are neutropenic, although leukopenia may be due to either neutropenia or lymphopenia; as a result, the terms leukopenia, neutropenia, and granulocytopenia are often used interchangeably. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-induced-neutropenia-and-agranulocytosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug-induced neutropenia and agranulocytosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-neutropenia-in-children-and-adolescents#H1\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of neutropenia in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Introduction'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-unexplained-neutropenia#H1875273819\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with unexplained neutropenia&quot;, section on 'Introduction'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with leukopenia may require adjustment in drug dosing, although precise levels for such dose adjustment for SSZ have not been established. Our approach in patients with mild leukopenia (total WBC of less than approximately 4000) is to temporarily discontinue SSZ and then to resume treatment when the WBC improves, with a dose reduction and careful weekly monitoring for several weeks with gradually increasing monitoring intervals. SSZ should be discontinued permanently if severe leukopenia develops (total WBC of less than 3000 or absolute neutrophil count of less than 1500), and weekly monitoring of cell counts should be performed until they stabilize in a normal range.</p><p>Serious episodes of agranulocytosis, when they do occur, are usually observed within the first three months and often within the first six weeks of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfasalazine-pharmacology-administration-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/2,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,42</a>]. Agranulocytosis may be caused by immune-mediated destruction of circulating neutrophils by drug-induced antibodies or by direct toxic effects upon marrow granulocytic precursors. Agranulocytosis caused by a hypersensitivity reaction requires drug discontinuation without rechallenge.</p><p>Concurrent use of SSZ and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a> may result in a greater depression of neutrophil counts than that which occurs with the use of either agent alone. This was noted in a 2005 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warning in the prescribing information for etanercept that stated that the combination resulted in a mild decrease in mean neutrophil counts when compared with groups treated with etanercept or SSZ alone. However, the clinical significance of this finding and whether it applies to other TNF inhibitor combinations with SSZ is unknown.

Benefit in patients with RA is largely attributed to sulfapyridine, although the parent molecule may also have a role. Sulfapyridine is metabolized in the liver via hydroxylation and acetylation, and the half-life of these components is prolonged in slow acetylators, a property which may affect toxicity but not efficacy. No major drug-drug interactions have been reported. (See <a href=\"#H6980055\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of action'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The dose of SSZ should be increased gradually with regular laboratory monitoring to minimize the risk of adverse effects. A complete blood count (CBC), liver transaminases, and creatinine levels should be obtained prior to beginning treatment with SSZ, after significantly increasing the dose, and periodically during therapy, especially during the first three months following initiation of SSZ. The usual starting dose is 500 mg daily, and the usual maximum dose administered is 2 to 3 g daily in divided doses. (See <a href=\"#H363400849\" class=\"local\">'Dosing and monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adverse reactions are common with SSZ. Approximately 20 to 25 percent of patients withdrew from clinical trials because of intolerable side effects. Two-thirds of such withdrawals resulted from symptoms due to gastrointestinal and central nervous system toxicity, and approximately 4 to 5 percent of withdrawals were because of rash. However, SSZ is generally relatively well tolerated by most patients with RA. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The side effects of SSZ are either idiosyncratic (eg, hypersensitivity-related or immune-related) or dose-related (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Idiosyncratic effects include skin reactions, hepatitis, pneumonitis, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and hemolytic anemia. Hemolytic anemia may be more common in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)-deficient individuals. When such reactions occur, the drug should be immediately stopped, and the patient should not be rechallenged.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dose-related side effects include gastrointestinal upset, central nervous system symptoms, and some less severe hematologic toxicities. Symptoms and laboratory findings of such involvement include anorexia, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, gastric distress, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, and megaloblastic anemia.
