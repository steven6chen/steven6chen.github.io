Normal red blood cells are round. When people have sickle cell disease, some of their red blood cells can have an abnormal shape. The abnormally shaped cells get stuck in the blood vessels easily, and so they don't bring enough oxygen to the body's organs. This can cause pain or organ damage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35019089\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I do first?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your child is diagnosed with sickle cell disease, it's very important that he or she see a doctor who specializes in treating the disorder as soon as possible. Doctors who are experts in sickle cell disease are usually &quot;hematologists.&quot; When you find a sickle cell disease expert, talk to him or her about all the things you will need to do at home to take care of your child. Also, make sure your child keeps seeing the sickle cell disease expert, and not just his or her regular doctor.</p><p>Doctors have learned a lot about sickle cell disease in recent years. To keep your child as healthy as possible, the key will be to know how to spot problems early and to know what to do about them.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3510158809\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I help my child stay as healthy as possible?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One way is by making sure he or she gets regular check-ups with his or her sickle cell doctor. These are very important for children with sickle cell disease. It's also important to make sure you know how to contact the doctor or nurse in case of an emergency.</p><p>During routine visits your child will be checked for problems that can happen because of sickle cell disease. This includes blood tests. Your child will also get vaccines that can prevent certain serious infections. This will include a flu shot every year as well as some vaccines that children without sickle cell disease do not get. These vaccines are very important, because infections in children with sickle cell disease are dangerous.</p><p>You can also help your child by making sure he or she takes any medicines the doctor has prescribed. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Hydroxyurea</a> is one medicine given to people with sickle cell disease who have episodes of pain or other effects of the condition. It helps your child's body make red blood cells that can move around the blood more easily. Children with problems like pain or breathing problems are treated with hydroxyurea. It comes as a pill, but there are pharmacies that can make it into a liquid that is easier for children to swallow. Talk to your doctor about whether hydroxyurea is right for your child.</p><p>Some children have more serious problems with blood flow, such as strokes or blood getting stuck in the spleen (see <a href=\"#H3827297490\" class=\"local\">'The spleen'</a> below). For those children, blood transfusions may be needed. Blood transfusions are also given before surgery.</p><p>It's important to be aware of the problems that can happen in children with sickle cell disease. Below is a list of the most important things to watch for.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3827297490\"><span class=\"h1\">The spleen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The spleen is an organ in the body that filters blood and helps fight infections. It is in the upper left part of the belly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F61816\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61816 \">figure 1</a>). People with sickle cell disease can have two problems with the spleen:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sickled red blood cells can damage the spleen. After the first few months of life, the spleen no longer works well to help fight certain infections. This is why people with sickle cell disease need to take extra care to prevent infections and to treat infections right away. (See <a href=\"#H35019213\" class=\"local\">'Preventing and treating infections'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood can get trapped in the spleen and not be able to move to the rest of the body. When this happens, the spleen can get very large. If your child gets dizzy or passes out, call the doctor right away or go to the emergency department. There, doctors can check to see if a spleen problem is the cause.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Your child's doctor might also tell you to check your child's belly every day so you will know if the spleen is getting bigger. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35019213\"><span class=\"h1\">Preventing and treating infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any infection in a child with sickle cell disease can be serious. This is why it's so important for your child to get all of his or her vaccines. To further help prevent infection, your child might need to take penicillin (an antibiotic) twice a day starting soon after birth. The doctor will tell you when your child can stop taking daily penicillin. </p><p>You should bring your child to a doctor right away if your child <strong>ever</strong> gets a fever. Talk to your doctor about a plan so you know what to do when your child gets a fever, and what temperature is high enough for you to call. You should see a doctor or go to the emergency room even if the fever comes down quickly with or without medicines to bring down fever.</p><p>You should also call the doctor if your child shows other signs of infection, even without a fever. This includes feeling very tired, loss of appetite, stiff neck, headache, trouble breathing, or cough.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35019183\"><span class=\"h1\">Managing your child's pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with sickle cell disease can have bouts of pain or swollen, painful fingers or toes (called &quot;dactylitis&quot;). You can learn to spot the signs of pain in your child. Your child's doctor will talk to you about ways to reduce pain and how to treat pain at home. They might prescribe pain medicines. The doctor will also tell you what to do if the medicines aren't helping enough, including when to call the office or go to the emergency room.</p><p>Pain can look different in children of different ages:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A baby who is in pain will not always cry. Instead, he or she might be less active or just lie still. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A school-aged child who is in pain might lose interest in his or her usual activities or try to ignore the pain. If the pain is not treated early, it can become hard to control. Teach your child to always tell you or another adult if he or she is having pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An older child may complain of pain or may have trouble concentrating in school because of pain.</p><p/><p>There are also some things you can do to help prevent pain episodes, or make the episodes a little easier for your child to handle. The main one is to take <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">hydroxyurea</a> if your child's doctor has prescribed it. (See <a href=\"#H3510158809\" class=\"local\">'How can I help my child stay as healthy as possible?'</a> above.)</p><p>Other things that might help include making sure your child drinks enough fluids, eats a healthy diet, avoids very cold temperatures, takes his or her medicines, and gets enough sleep. If your child is dealing with stress at school or at home, it's also important to try to address this and help your child feel more relaxed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35019168\"><span class=\"h1\">Coughing and breathing problems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with sickle cell disease can get a dangerous condition called &quot;acute chest syndrome.&quot; It can cause symptoms like those of an infection in the lungs (called &quot;pneumonia&quot;). If your child ever has a bad cough or any wheezing or trouble breathing, take him or her to the doctor or emergency room right away.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35019151\"><span class=\"h1\">The risk of stroke</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with sickle cell disease are at risk of stroke. If your child ever has symptoms of a stroke, call the doctor who treats your child's sickle cell disease and take your child to the hospital. The symptoms of a stroke can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not being able to wake up</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble speaking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drooping of the face on one side</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weakness in an arm or leg</p><p/><p>Your child's doctor will do regular ultrasound tests called &quot;transcranial Doppler&quot; to find out your child's risk of getting a stroke. This test is usually done every year starting when a child is 2 years old. If the test shows that your child has a high risk of stroke, your doctor will suggest additional tests <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> treatments that can help prevent a stroke.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35019134\"><span class=\"h1\">Long-lasting erections in boys</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Boys with sickle cell disease can get a problem called &quot;priapism.&quot; Priapism is an erection that happens when blood gets trapped in the penis. It can be very painful and is not related to having sex or wanting to have sex. If your son gets an erection that is painful or does not go away, talk to his doctor. An erection that lasts more than 4 hours can cause long-term damage to the penis. If your son gets an erection that lasts 4 hours, take him to see the doctor or to an emergency room right away.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35019119\"><span class=\"h1\">If I have another child, will he or she have sickle cell disease too?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you are planning to have more children, there is a risk that your other children could also have sickle cell disease. Your doctor or a genetic counselor can talk to you about these risks.</p><p>There is also a chance that your child could pass sickle cell disease on to his or her future children. When your child gets older and starts thinking about planning a family, he or she should talk to a doctor about the risks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35019228\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sickle-cell-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sickle cell disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-marrow-transplant-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bone marrow transplant (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-babies-and-children-age-0-to-6-years-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for babies and children age 0 to 6 years (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-children-age-7-to-18-years-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for children age 7 to 18 years (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=priapism-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Priapism (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Stroke (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-bone-marrow-transplantation-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hematopoietic cell transplantation (bone marrow transplantation) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-infants-and-children-age-0-to-6-years-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vaccines for infants and children age 0 to 6 years (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-children-age-7-to-18-years-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vaccines for children age 7 to 18 years (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=adult-vaccines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Adult vaccines (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
