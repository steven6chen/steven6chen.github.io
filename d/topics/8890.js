As a result, there is a small amount of egg protein in these vaccines. Thus, there is a theoretical risk of inducing an allergic reaction when administering the influenza vaccine to an individual with egg allergy. However, many of these same patients are also at higher risk of an adverse outcome due to influenza infection (eg, age &lt;2 years, history of asthma) and would therefore benefit from vaccination.</p><p>This topic reviews the risks and benefits of administration of the influenza vaccine in patients with egg allergy. Other issues related to egg allergy (including prevalence) and allergic reactions to vaccines are discussed separately.

Seasonal influenza results in higher mortality rates among patients with certain chronic medical conditions (eg, asthma), pregnant women, and those at the extremes of age. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of seasonal influenza in adults&quot;, section on 'Complications of influenza'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seasonal-influenza-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seasonal influenza in children: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-and-pregnancy#H5795631\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Influenza and pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Clinical course in pregnancy'</a>.)</p><p>Influenza vaccination is recommended for all individuals six months of age and older and is particularly important in those at increased risk of complications.

These may include residual animal proteins, antibiotics, preservatives, stabilizers, virus-inactivating compounds, and latex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-vaccination-in-individuals-with-egg-allergy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Thus, episodes of anaphylaxis caused by the influenza vaccine may be due to components other than egg. As an example, there were 12 adverse events consistent with possible anaphylaxis after administration of an egg-free influenza vaccine (Flublok) that were reported between January 16, 2013 and July 31, 2014 through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-vaccination-in-individuals-with-egg-allergy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These reactions occurred in adults with self-reported egg allergy or a previous allergic reaction to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-virus-vaccine-inactivated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">inactivated influenza vaccine</a> (IIV). Had these patients received an egg-containing vaccine, their reactions may have been erroneously attributed to egg.</p><p>In another example, a particular brand of influenza vaccine used in Japan during the 2011 to 2012 season was associated with a high rate of anaphylaxis. These patients had elevated levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE) against the immunizing agent (hemagglutinin) compared with controls with and without egg allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-vaccination-in-individuals-with-egg-allergy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

No studies have directly compared the rate of anaphylactic reactions between the intranasal live-attenuated vaccine and the injectable trivalent inactivated vaccine.

Alternative methods of influenza virus propagation have been developed, although allergic reactions to these vaccines are still possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-vaccination-in-individuals-with-egg-allergy/abstract/25-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-32</a>].

This same vaccine (called Flucelvax) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2012 for individuals &ge;18 years of age and the quadrivalent form was approved for ages &ge;4 years in May 2016 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F79474\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79474 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-vaccination-in-individuals-with-egg-allergy/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. The seed strain used to make this vaccine is passaged in hens' eggs, and therefore the vaccine may contain minuscule amounts of ovalbumin, in the range of 5 x 10<sup>-8</sup> micrograms per 0.5 mL dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-vaccination-in-individuals-with-egg-allergy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The package insert does not mention egg allergy as a precaution or contraindication. This virtually egg-free vaccine has been evaluated in 6281 adults in seven randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-vaccination-in-individuals-with-egg-allergy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>] and in 1664 children aged 4 to 17 years in a single randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-vaccination-in-individuals-with-egg-allergy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The efficacy of Flucelvax was 84 percent in one of the trials, which is comparable with that reported for standard available influenza vaccines. In addition, rates of serious adverse events in the cell-based vaccine groups were similar to that seen in the egg-based vaccine groups and placebo groups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second trivalent influenza vaccine that is not produced in eggs (Flublok) was approved by the FDA in January 2013 for patients aged 18 to 49 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-vaccination-in-individuals-with-egg-allergy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>] and was approved for patients 50 years and older in 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-vaccination-in-individuals-with-egg-allergy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. This egg-free vaccine contains three full-length recombinant hemagglutinin influenza virus proteins (two influenza strain type A proteins and one type B protein) that are made using an insect virus (baculovirus) expression system and recombinant DNA technology. Significant antigenic mismatch between the vaccine antigens and circulating viruses in one randomized trial of 4648 healthy adults made efficacy against antigenically matched strains difficult to confirm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-vaccination-in-individuals-with-egg-allergy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. However, vaccine efficacy against all strains was 44.8 percent, similar to that seen with traditional influenza vaccines.

A randomized trial in 156 children 6 to 59 months found that Flublok was less immunogenic than standard IIV, particularly in children &lt;3 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-vaccination-in-individuals-with-egg-allergy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO EVALUATION AND VACCINE ADMINISTRATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H50073519\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin testing (prick or intradermal) with influenza vaccine prior to administration is no longer recommended for patients with egg allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-vaccination-in-individuals-with-egg-allergy/abstract/1,36,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,36,42</a>]. In studies of patients with egg allergy, the presence of a positive skin test to influenza vaccine is not predictive of a subsequent reaction. Skin testing with the vaccine is still appropriate when evaluating a patient with a history of a reaction to the influenza vaccine itself as opposed to a history of reaction to egg.

The amount of egg protein in the vaccines has decreased significantly over the years, and all egg-based vaccines now have low ovalbumin levels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F79474\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79474 \">table 1</a>). No serious reactions have been reported after administration of egg-based LAIV or IIV (containing &lt;0.24 mcg per 0.2 mL dose for LAIV and up to 0.7 mcg ovalbumin per 0.5 mL dose for IIV) in recipients with egg allergy, including in those with a history of anaphylaxis. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Vaccine egg protein content'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Risk of anaphylaxis to vaccines'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Safety of vaccines in patients with egg allergy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin testing with influenza vaccine prior to administration in patients with egg allergy is no longer suggested. Skin testing with the vaccine is still appropriate when evaluating a patient with a history of a reaction to the influenza vaccine itself, as opposed to a history of reaction to egg. Patients with a history of an allergic reaction to the influenza vaccine should be referred to an allergy specialist for evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H50073519\" class=\"local\">'Risk assessment'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergic-reactions-to-vaccines\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergic reactions to vaccines&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that all patients &ge;6 months of age with egg allergy, including those with a history of anaphylaxis, receive annual immunization with an influenza vaccine according to the indications for all other patients without egg allergy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Approach to evaluation and vaccine administration'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seasonal-influenza-in-children-prevention-with-vaccines#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seasonal influenza in children: Prevention with vaccines&quot;, section on 'Target groups'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults#H766698187\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seasonal influenza vaccination in adults&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We would administer any age-appropriate, approved injectable influenza vaccine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F79474\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79474 \">table 1</a>) in these patients according to the indications and contraindications outlined in the tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67562\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67562 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F60449\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60449 \">table 3</a>). The vaccine is administered in the usual manner (ie, in a single dose rather than in two or more doses as a graded challenge and without a special observation period following the vaccine). (See <a href=\"#H630395\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaccine providers and screening questionnaires do not need to ask about the egg allergy status of recipients of influenza vaccine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allergic reactions to the influenza vaccine, including anaphylaxis, may still occur, as with any vaccine. These reactions can be caused by the immunizing agent itself or to other <span class=\"nowrap\">proteins/haptens</span> besides egg that are introduced into the vaccine during the production process. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Risk of anaphylaxis to vaccines'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergic-reactions-to-vaccines\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergic reactions to vaccines&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any provider who administers any vaccine to any individual should have the personnel, medications, and resuscitative equipment available to treat potential anaphylaxis.</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-vaccination-in-individuals-with-egg-allergy/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Kelso JM, Greenhawt MJ, Li JT, et al.
