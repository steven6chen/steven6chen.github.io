Challenges in management include distinguishing acute stroke from other cerebrovascular manifestations of the disease such as meningitis, cerebral malaria, or seizure disorder, and distinguishing acute ischemic stroke from hemorrhagic stroke. Care of the patient with an acute stroke requires specialized expertise in exchange transfusion practices.</p><p>This topic discusses an approach to the acute assessment and treatment of stroke in children and adults with SCD.</p><p>Risk stratification and primary stroke prevention, as well as secondary prevention for individuals with SCD who have had an acute stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) are presented in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-stroke-initial-or-recurrent-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of stroke (initial or recurrent) in sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3240042857\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS AND IMMEDIATE MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals with SCD are at risk of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, especially those with HbSS or HbS-beta<sup>0</sup> thalassemia. It has been estimated that without intervention, 11 percent of patients with SCD will have a clinically apparent stroke by age 20 years, and one-fourth of patients with SCD will have a stroke by age 45. Stroke risk factors and epidemiology in patients with SCD are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-stroke-initial-or-recurrent-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of stroke (initial or recurrent) in sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of suspected stroke involves a rapid initial clinical assessment accompanied by neuroimaging to differentiate ischemia from hemorrhage and to exclude stroke mimics.</p><p>Cerebral infarction is defined as brain, spinal cord, or retinal cell death attributable to ischemia; the diagnosis is based on clinical, neuroimaging, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neuropathologic evidence of permanent injury. Hemorrhagic stroke includes intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), which involves bleeding directly into the brain and formation of hematoma; and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), in which bleeding occurs directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) under arterial pressure. The blood spreads quickly within the CSF, leading to a rapid increase in intracranial pressure. Death or deep coma may ensue if the bleeding continues.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1973097539\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute ischemic stroke due to vaso-occlusion in cerebral vessels is the first consideration in a patient known to have SCD who presents with new neurologic findings or severe headache. However, it is also important not to overlook other potential causes of neurologic deterioration, especially in adults.</p><p>Clinical assessment of the patient with SCD who presents with a potential stroke based on a new neurologic defect (focal or nonfocal) or altered level of consciousness includes consideration of the following diagnoses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-stroke-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute ischemic stroke</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute hemorrhagic stroke</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transient ischemic attack (TIA)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute meningitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizure, particularly when associated with prolonged postictal paralysis (Todd&rsquo;s)</p><p/><p>If clinical suspicion for an acute ischemic stroke is high, the patients should receive a simple transfusion before undergoing neuroimaging. (See <a href=\"#H364639770\" class=\"local\">'Immediate management (all patients)'</a> below.)</p><p>Additional nonvascular conditions that can mimic stroke include migraine, tumors and other structural brain lesions; familial alternating hemiplegia; reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome; metabolic derangements; intracranial infection (eg, brain abscess, meningoencephalitis, or cerebral malaria); demyelinating conditions such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, drug toxicity, postinfectious cerebellitis; musculoskeletal conditions; and psychogenic conditions. One consideration in particular for patients on chronic opioid therapy is the possibility of opioid overdose. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ischemic-stroke-in-children-and-young-adults-etiology-and-clinical-features#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ischemic stroke in children and young adults: Etiology and clinical features&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.) </p><p>The most common locations for an acute ischemic stroke in patients with SCD include large vessel territories and borderzone regions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50288\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50288 \">figure 1</a>). Hemorrhagic transformation of infarcts can occur in these sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-stroke-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Age may be somewhat helpful for predicting the ultimate diagnosis. Ischemic stroke is more common than hemorrhagic stroke in children and adolescents with SCD. Hemorrhagic stroke is more common than ischemic stroke in adults with SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-stroke-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, individuals of all ages with SCD may have any of these diagnoses. </p><p>The clinical features may suggest certain stroke subtypes, though no clinical features are pathognomonic for distinguishing different types of stroke:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ischemic stroke</strong> &ndash; Infants with stroke may present with focal weakness, but are more likely than older children to present with seizures and altered mental status. Older children usually have hemiparesis or other focal neurologic signs such as aphasia, visual disturbance, or cerebellar signs, although seizures, headache, and lethargy are not uncommon. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ischemic-stroke-in-children-and-young-adults-etiology-and-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ischemic stroke in children and young adults: Etiology and clinical features&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-evaluation-of-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the evaluation of stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intracerebral hemorrhage</strong> &ndash; The presentation of intracerebral hemorrhage depends primarily on the size of the hematoma, anatomical location, and extension of the hemorrhage into the ventricles. Typically, rapid onset of neurologic dysfunction and signs of increased intracranial pressure such as headache, vomiting, and decreased level of consciousness are seen. For patients with large volume hemorrhage, stupor or coma is typical. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Subarachnoid hemorrhage</strong> &ndash; The primary symptom of aneurysmal SAH is a sudden, severe headache, which may or may not be associated with a brief loss of consciousness, nausea or vomiting, and meningismus. Restricted subarachnoid hemorrhage may manifest with transient motor or sensory symptoms that suggest epileptic phenomena <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> frank seizures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonaneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonaneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot;</a>.) &#160; </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cerebral venous thrombosis</strong> &ndash; The clinical presentation of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT; also called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis) is highly variable because there may be associated brain swelling, edema, venous infarction, or hemorrhagic venous infarction caused by venous occlusion. The onset can be acute, subacute, or chronic. Headache (of gradual, acute, or thunderclap onset) is the most frequent symptom, and may occur as part of an isolated intracranial hypertension syndrome, with or without vomiting, papilledema, and visual problems. In other cases, headache may be accompanied by focal neurologic deficits, focal or generalized seizures, and encephalopathy with altered mental status or coma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cerebral-venous-thrombosis-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cerebral venous thrombosis: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The major management implication of the distinction between an acute ischemic versus hemorrhagic event is in helping to decide whether urgent exchange transfusion is appropriate. Urgent exchange transfusion is used for patients with acute ischemic stroke (and patients with hemorrhagic transformation of an acute ischemic stroke), but not for those with hemorrhagic stroke. Patients with TIA are not treated with urgent exchange transfusion, but they should undergo further evaluation for stroke risk and consideration of prophylactic transfusions. (See <a href=\"#H3666038758\" class=\"local\">'Transfusion'</a> below.)</p><p>The distinction between a vascular lesion such as infarction or bleeding and an infectious cause of acute symptoms is also essential. Prompt institution of broad spectrum antibiotics may be lifesaving for those with acute meningitis, as individuals with SCD are functionally asplenic and at risk for overwhelming infection with encapsulated and other organisms. Fever <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> leukocytosis may be a sign of meningitis or another infection such as acute chest syndrome (ACS) with pneumonia. Fever may also be seen with stroke in the absence of infection; however, all patients with SCD who present with fever and acute neurologic findings should be treated presumptively for a bacterial infection until this possibility is eliminated, unless there is a good rationale not to do so. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-fever-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of fever in sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As noted above, other rare stroke mimics must be considered if the initial evaluation and imaging do not reveal a cause for the patient&rsquo;s symptoms. A discussion of other causes of focal neurologic findings in the differential diagnosis of stroke is presented separately.

Use of additional management strategies to maximize cerebral perfusion, ventilation, and maintenance of a normoglycemic state are also critical. Hydration with normal saline rather than hypotonic saline will avoid the potential worsening of cytotoxic cerebral edema that may occur with infusion of hypotonic fluid; excessive fluids should be avoided, however. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-assessment-and-management-of-acute-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial assessment and management of acute stroke&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ischemic-stroke-in-children-evaluation-initial-management-and-prognosis#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ischemic stroke in children: Evaluation, initial management, and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Supportive measures'</a>.)</p><p>For those with moyamoya syndrome (bilateral cerebral artery stenosis with prominent collateral vessels) and acute stroke, acute treatment is mainly symptomatic and directed towards reducing elevated intracranial pressure, improving cerebral blood flow, and controlling seizures. Additional management issues related to moyamoya syndrome are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moyamoya-disease-treatment-and-prognosis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Moyamoya disease: Treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Acute management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1007030545\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuroimaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neuroimaging is critical for all patients with suspected stroke. In children, a head computed tomography (CT) is generally considered inadequate to diagnose ischemic stroke, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be required to reliably exclude stroke mimics. As noted above (see <a href=\"#H1973097539\" class=\"local\">'Clinical assessment'</a> above), patients with a high suspicion of acute ischemic stroke should receive a simple transfusion prior to neuroimaging. Transfusion may also reduce the risk of complications from sedation should sedation for the imaging procedure be required. </p><p>Brain MRI is more sensitive for acute ischemia than CT, particularly with use of diffusion-weighted imaging in the hyperacute time period. In addition, brain MRI provides better visualization of the posterior fossa, and is able to detect intracerebral hemorrhage with excellent sensitivity using high susceptibility sequences. Head CT can be substituted if MRI is not tolerated or will not be available within 48 hours after stroke onset. In adults, either CT or MRI may be used as the initial study, though brain MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging is preferred if available because it is more sensitive for the diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke than CT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ischemic-stroke-in-children-evaluation-initial-management-and-prognosis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ischemic stroke in children: Evaluation, initial management, and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Neuroimaging'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuroimaging of acute ischemic stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Limitations of MRI include a requirement for patient cooperation, which may not be possible for very young children, and cost. For young children who cannot cooperate, MRI may be performed with sedation, which carries additional risks and costs. In contrast, CT may be easier to obtain, and unenhanced CT may reveal an area of hemorrhage. However, CT is a source of radiation exposure. </p><p>Given these considerations, the imaging approach and local institutional practices may vary. When an MRI can be obtained rapidly this is the preferable imaging study. An alternative approach if MRI is not rapidly available is to perform an initial CT scan to evaluate the possibility of acute hemorrhage, and if this is normal, to obtain an MRI once the patient is stabilized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-stroke-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Neurovascular imaging with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or CT angiography should be obtained in all adults and children with acute stroke to look for large vessel arteriopathy (eg, dissection, moyamoya, atherosclerosis) and to exclude aneurysm. When cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is a consideration, brain MRI in combination with magnetic resonance venography (MRV) is the most sensitive technique for demonstrating the thrombus and the occluded dural sinus or vein. A more extensive discussion of neuroimaging in the diagnosis of acute stroke is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuroimaging of acute ischemic stroke&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cerebral-venous-thrombosis-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cerebral venous thrombosis: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Neuroimaging'</a>.)</p><p>As discussed separately, a large portion of the world&rsquo;s SCD population may not have access to neuroimaging, especially in the acute setting. For these individuals, it may be necessary to make a presumptive diagnosis based on clinical features alone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sickle-cell-disease-in-sub-saharan-africa#H12700447\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sickle cell disease in sub-Saharan Africa&quot;, section on 'Stroke'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3672809167\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory and other testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with SCD who have a suspected or confirmed stroke should have a complete blood count (CBC), reticulocyte count, percent hemoglobin S, type and crossmatch for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. The CBC and other hematologic studies are critical to management because RBC transfusion is the cornerstone of treatment, and it must be titrated to percent hemoglobin S and total hemoglobin, in order to lower the sickle hemoglobin sufficiently without precipitating hyperviscosity syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-sickle-cell-disease#H149628\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusion in sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Risk of hyperviscosity syndrome from simple transfusion'</a>.)</p><p>Coagulation studies (prothrombin time [PT] and activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT]) and basic metabolic profile with electrolytes, urea nitrogen, creatinine, and glucose should also be obtained as a baseline and to eliminate stroke mimics such as hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-stroke-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Other testing includes oxygen saturation, echocardiography, and electrocardiography. The role of these studies is discussed in more detail separately.

The goal is to lower the percentage of sickle hemoglobin to &le;30 percent of total hemoglobin and to aim for a total hemoglobin level of approximately, but not greater than, 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>. This is best achieved using exchange transfusion. However, as noted above, we give a simple transfusion right away because it takes time to mobilize resources for exchange transfusion (and may require transfer of the patient to another facility). (See <a href=\"#H364639770\" class=\"local\">'Immediate management (all patients)'</a> above.)</p><p>Evidence for the benefit of transfusion in patients with SCD and acute stroke includes our clinical experience and basic studies of the physiology of the disease, in which sickling and hypoxemia interact to worsen vaso-occlusion (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-stroke-initial-or-recurrent-in-sickle-cell-disease#H1689723805\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of stroke (initial or recurrent) in sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Mechanisms'</a>), and the expectation of significant morbidity and mortality if no intervention is made. There are no randomized trials comparing transfusion with other interventions in the setting of acute stroke in patients with SCD.</p><p>The potential benefits of providing simple transfusion initially include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less delay in starting therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Possible mitigation of the risks of the placement of an exchange catheter</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapid improvement in hemoglobin level </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allowance of time to prepare for exchange transfusion, which may include transfer to another facility with blood bank support for the procedure </p><p/><p>The rationale for our use of exchange transfusion rather than simple transfusion includes our clinical experience in this setting and the general observation that simple transfusion cannot lower the percentage of hemoglobin S sufficiently without causing hyperviscosity or transfusional volume overload. Randomized trials comparing exchange transfusion with simple transfusion for acute stroke in SCD are lacking. </p><p>Exchange transfusion may also reduce the risk of stroke recurrence. This was suggested by a retrospective study of 137 children with SCD who had an acute stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-stroke-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. For the 52 patients who presented within 24 hours of onset of initial stroke symptom for whom treatment information was available, second strokes were more likely in those who received simple transfusions (8 of 14 patients [57 percent]) compared with those who were treated with exchange transfusions (8 of 38 patients [21 percent]; RR 5.0, 95% CI 1.3-18.6), despite similar baseline risk factors. </p><p>Our approach is consistent with a 2014 consensus report on SCD management from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-stroke-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>The role of transfusion therapy in the immediate setting of a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or as a prophylactic measure following TIAs has not been studied in a systematic fashion. Despite the lack of such studies, guidelines published by the American Heart Association and the American Stroke Association recommend chronic transfusion therapy for such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-stroke-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Guidelines do not recommend prophylactic transfusions following TIA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-stroke-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The optimal duration of such therapy is also uncertain. A reasonable approach in a patient with no recurrence of TIAs on chronic transfusion and no evidence of significant cerebral vasculopathy or silent infarcts on <span class=\"nowrap\">MRI/MRA</span> studies would be to make a gradual transition to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> therapy after 6 to 12 months of chronic transfusion therapy.</p><p>Additional information about the differences between simple and exchange transfusion, an overview of transfusion practices in SCD, and a discussion of transfusion risks, are presented separately.

For patients with a greater likelihood of another cause of ischemic stroke such as embolism in the setting of atrial fibrillation, we would treat them similarly to the general population unless there is a strong reason not to do so. &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Thrombolytic therapy</strong> &ndash; We generally do not use thrombolytic therapy for patients with SCD and ischemic stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-stroke-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, thrombolytic therapy may be appropriate for selected patients such as an individual whose life is at risk and for whom no other therapies are available, or an individual with a stroke mechanism unrelated to SCD, such as atrial fibrillation or large artery atherosclerotic stenosis (ie, for whom an embolic stroke is highly likely). Input from an individual with expertise in this area is especially important in this setting, as there are no high-quality data to guide practice. There is also concern that the use of thrombolytic agent could precipitate intracranial hemorrhage, the risk of which is higher than average in individuals with SCD. An observational study of patients with acute ischemic stroke that compared 832 individuals with SCD and 3328 non-SCD controls found no difference in the fraction receiving thrombolytic therapy (8.2 versus 9.4 percent) or in the incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage complicating thrombolytic therapy (4.9 versus 3.2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-stroke-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, the effect of thrombolytic therapy on functional outcomes was not reported. Given that thrombolytic therapy is recommended therapy for ischemic stroke, these findings suggest that it may be appropriate in patients with SCD who meet criteria for its use.
