Both procedures require in vitro fertilization even if the couple is not sub-fertile, biopsy of in vitro embryos for genetic testing, and transfer of embryos based on the results of genetic testing. Genetic testing can also be performed on the first and second polar bodies obtained from mature oocytes prior to and after fertilization.</p><p>This topic will discuss issues related to PGS. PGD is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preimplantation-genetic-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preimplantation genetic testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H430015509\"><span class=\"h1\">ROLE OF PGS VERSUS PGD</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Preimplantation genetic screening (PGS)</strong> &ndash; The goal of PGS is to identify de-novo aneuploidy, including subchromosomal deletions and additions, in embryos of couples known (or presumed) to be euploid. Forty to 60 percent of preimplantation embryos are aneuploid, which is one potential etiology for the relatively low implantation efficiency of both natural conceptions and in vitro fertilization (IVF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-screening/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Theoretically, performing IVF, determining the genetic status (chromosomal copy numbers) of the preimplantation embryos, and then selecting only euploid embryos for embryo transfer should increase the rate of successful implantation per transferred embryo, and possibly reduce the chance of miscarriage; however, the live birth rate from the total cohort of embryos available will not be increased because of the limitations described below (see <a href=\"#H5938038\" class=\"local\">'Limitations of PGS'</a> below). Transferring a single embryo will reduce multiple pregnancy rates by allowing efficient single embryo transfers. Examination of embryo morphology and rate of development under the microscope or with a time-lapse system is not able to differentiate euploid embryos from aneuploid embryos.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD)</strong> &ndash; The goal of PGD is to establish a pregnancy that is unaffected by a specific gene mutation(s) when one or both biologic parents is a known carrier of a specific gene mutation(s). Additionally, PGD can be used to identify an unbalanced chromosomal complement when one parent is a carrier of a balanced translocation or chromosomal rearrangement. It is also used to select embryos for transfer that have a specific genetic complement, such as particular sex chromosomes or human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type. For example, if a child has Fanconi anemia, a sibling with a compatible HLA type and absence of Fanconi anemia could become a donor for hematopoietic cell transplantation.

This is mainly due to improvements in culture conditions, resulting in more consistent survival of cultured embryos to the blastocyst stage; improvements in biopsy techniques; improvements in cryopreservation of blastocysts, mainly vitrification; and evidence that cleavage stage biopsy may reduce the take-home baby rate compared with not performing the biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-screening/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Embryos usually reach the blastocyst stage of development five to six days following fertilization (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F55217\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55217 \">figure 1</a>). Occasionally, embryos develop into blastocysts after day 6 and a live birth from an embryo that developed into a blastocyst on day 7 has been reported, but the overall pregnancy rate from developmentally delayed embryos is low. Routinely, five to 10 trophectoderm cells overlying the anembryonic pole are removed for analysis (the blastocyst has approximately 40 trophectoderm cells and a total of 50 to 90 cells at this stage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-screening/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]). Some slower developing embryos, ie, compacted morulae and cavitating morulae, may also be biopsied, and fewer cells (three to five cells) may also provide accurate results. While outcomes data are not available for embryos biopsied at this stage, euploid embryos have been identified and pregnancies have resulted from transfer of these embryos, which might be useful for patients with limited numbers of embryos.</p><p>The availability of this many cells for testing reduces, but does not eliminate, the frequency of diagnostic errors inherent with sampling only one or two cells from a day 3 cleavage stage embryo, which normally contains only 6 to 10 cells. It also appears to be less disruptive to the embryo than cleavage stage biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-screening/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In a randomized trial, embryos that underwent blastocyst biopsy had a similar sustained implantation rate as non-biopsied controls (51 versus 54 percent), whereas cleavage-stage biopsy markedly reduced the rate of sustained implantation (30 percent versus 50 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-screening/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, the design of this study introduces the potential for bias against day 3 embryo biopsy, as poorer quality embryos were selected for day 3 biopsy, while better-quality embryos were biopsied on day <span class=\"nowrap\">5/6</span>. </p><p>Culture of embryos to the blastocyst stage is not without risk. Some embryos that appear to be developing normally on day 3 will not survive to the blastocyst stage. The actual rate of potentially viable embryos that do not survive in extended culture is impossible to determine accurately. Approximately 50 percent of embryos survive to day 3 of development, but only approximately 25 percent survive to form good-quality blastocysts. Therefore, extended culture to the blastocyst stage may increase the number of patients who have no embryos suitable for transfer and may result in fewer embryos available for cryopreservation. Additional issues of extended culture include a small increase in the risk of monozygotic twinning, an increased probability of having a male child, and a potential small increase in the risk of epigenetic modifications leading to increased risk for adverse neonatal outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-screening/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2604676380\"><span class=\"h3\">Alternative procedures</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3135898968\"><span class=\"h4\">Polar body biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In countries where biopsy of an embryo is illegal, genetic analysis of the first and second polar bodies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F53222\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53222 \">figure 2</a>) is an option since the genetic composition of the polar body is predictive of the genetic composition of the oocyte [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-screening/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. As long as it is performed by an experienced individual, removal of the polar body or bodies is not harmful to the oocyte since polar bodies are a byproduct of cell division.</p><p>One disadvantage of this approach is that the oocyte must be fertilized before the results of polar body biopsy are available, which results in unnecessary and costly testing of the 30 percent of oocytes that will either not fertilize successfully (ie, develop two pronuclei) or will not undergo postfertilization development. Another disadvantage is its limited ability to predict the genetic status of the embryo since analysis of polar bodies does not detect abnormalities that develop after syngamy (fusion of the male and female pronucleus) and therefore any mitotic abnormalities. Lastly, it may misdiagnose a meiotic aneuploidy that goes on to self-correct. (See <a href=\"#H5938038\" class=\"local\">'Limitations of PGS'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2306964638\"><span class=\"h4\">Cleavage stage biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genetic analysis can be performed on one nucleated cell (blastomere) removed three days after fertilization. The embryo typically contains 6 to 10 cells at this time (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F55217\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55217 \">figure 1</a>). A single cell can be easily teased apart from its sibling blastomeres with biopsy on the morning of day 3. The embryo can be transferred after results of genetic testing are available, possibly later on day 3 or after extended culture to the blastocyst stage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-screening/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>After compaction (when blastomeres change their shape and align tightly against one another to form the compact morula), removal of a single blastomere without damage to adjacent cells is not possible because the cells are tightly adherent to one another and the cell borders are unclear.</p><p>Additionally, removal of a single blastomere only gives information about the chromosomal complement of that particular cell &ndash; the chromosomal complement of the rest of the cells comprising the embryo must be inferred from the results of the cell that was analyzed. This assumption can lead to erroneous results due to the high prevalence of mosaicism caused by mitotic non-disjunction after the first mitotic cell division.</p><p>Removing two blastomeres for analysis does not improve diagnostic performance and significantly inhibits the developmental potential of the embryo, thus defeating the goal of increasing the rate of successful implantation, pregnancy, and live birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-screening/abstract/6,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10</a>].</p><p>Despite these issues, blastomere biopsy was performed on day 3 embryos for a number of years and much of the data regarding the lack of efficacy of PGS was based on studies using this technique.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1617570609\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETIC EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H225572213\"><span class=\"h2\">Array comparative genomic hybridization and single nucleotide polymorphism arrays</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH or microarray) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays are the most common methods of genetic analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-screening/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. All 23 pairs of chromosomes are evaluated and results can be available within several hours, usually overnight, which enables transfer of fresh embryos the next day. Disadvantages of array CGH are that it cannot detect polyploidies, changes in DNA sequences (eg, point mutations), or small gains and losses in regions of the genome not covered by the microarray [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-screening/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, use of SNP microarrays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-screening/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] or next generation sequencing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-screening/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>] can overcome these limitations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-chromosomal-microarray-in-obstetrics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of chromosomal microarray in obstetrics&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tools-for-genetics-and-genomics-cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics#H15538652\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tools for genetics and genomics: Cytogenetics and molecular genetics&quot;, section on 'Array comparative genomic hybridization'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H567160038\"><span class=\"h2\">Next generation sequencing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In next generation sequencing, segments of chromosomes are sequenced to determine ploidy and identify specific pathologic mutations in the DNA sequence. It is becoming more commonly utilized for aneuploidy detection; however, the increased detection rate along with potential sampling errors may lead to over-reading abnormalities and discard of potentially viable embryos. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=next-generation-dna-sequencing-ngs-principles-and-clinical-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS): Principles and clinical applications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If genetic results are not available before the embryo must be transferred (six days following oocyte retrieval), the embryos are cryopreserved until after the results of the analysis become available. Additional embryos in excess of those being transferred can also be cryopreserved. Blastocyst biopsy on either day 5 or 6 along with vitrification of the entire cohort of embryos while awaiting the results of the genetic testing, followed by transfer in a subsequent unstimulated cycle is the most common technique.</p><p>With contemporary vitrification protocols, the majority of vitrified blastocysts (&gt;90 percent) survive vitrification and subsequent warming. Implantation rates of surviving blastocysts are equivalent to fresh blastocysts, indicating no significant reduction in embryo viability if the embryo survives. Some programs have observed an improvement in their implantation rates when embryos are transferred back to a uterus that has not been hyperstimulated and exposed to high estrogen levels and possibly to prematurely increased progesterone levels, although this finding is not universal and may depend on the method of ovarian stimulation used. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=in-vitro-fertilization#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;In vitro fertilization&quot;, section on 'Cryopreservation'</a>.)</p><p>Next generation sequencing to obtain whole genomic sequences in humans is possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-screening/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], and targeted sequencing could be used for detecting nonmedical traits (eg, intelligence, height); however, neither of these applications is reliably clinically available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3622545770\"><span class=\"h2\">Karyomapping</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Karyomapping to detect embryos at risk for a specific disorder may be an option when the specific molecular defects have not been characterized. It involves SNP genotyping the parents and a close relative, such as an existing child, for a known disease and identifying the disease loci on the chromosome. The section of parental DNA closely linked with the disease mutation is subsequently compared with the same section of DNA from the embryo (obtained by blastomere or trophectoderm biopsy). If the DNA segments match, the embryo has a significantly greater likelihood of being a carrier (one copy of that mutation) or affected with the disorder (two copies of the mutation). </p><p>SNP information from karyomapping may give chromosome copy number assessment, but the accuracy is dependent on the number of &quot;key&quot; SNPs obtained from each individual and its clinical use has not been validated. Karyomapping is often used in conjunction with the other methods to determine chromosome copy number.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3530274888\"><span class=\"h2\">Fluorescence in situ hybridization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is another technique for genetic testing but has several disadvantages that have made FISH testing in PGS obsolete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-screening/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>FISH can be performed on multiple cells removed from the trophectoderm of a blastocyst or from a single blastomere removed from a cleavage stage embryo; however, biopsy of cleavage stage embryos may reduce embryo viability. In a meta-analysis of randomized trials, PGS with FISH of cleavage stage embryos resulted in a lower live birth rate than in vitro fertilization without PGS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-screening/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This likely resulted from the limited number of cells sampled, the limited number of chromosomes analyzed, use of day 3 embryos, and technical factors (eg, poor fixation technique, hybridization failure, signal overlap, splitting).</p><p>Although FISH probes exist for every chromosome, FISH panels only contain 9 to 12 chromosome probes because only a limited number of sufficiently unique fluorochromes can be reliably resolved in a single interphase nucleus. Misdiagnosis due to overlapping signals becomes a problem as more unique fluorochromes are added to the panel. The specific chromosomes in the panel depend on the patient's prior history and include those involved in the most common aneuploidies identified in spontaneous abortions. Data from spontaneous abortions suggest that 9 to 12 chromosome probe FISH panels identify only 57 to 67 percent of aneuploid embryos detected by methods analyzing all chromosome pairs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-screening/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. By comparison, array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH or microarray) and SNP arrays can detect abnormalities of all 23 chromosome pairs as well as deletions and duplications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5938038\"><span class=\"h1\">LIMITATIONS OF PGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The body of evidence indicates that PGS using fluorescence in situ hybridization on blastomeres from cleavage stage embryos does not improve implantation and live birth rates (see <a href=\"#H5938045\" class=\"local\">'Clinical use'</a> below). Technical factors related to in vitro fertilization or embryo biopsy may be one reason for the lack of improvement. Moreover, an abnormal result from genetic analysis by any method does not necessarily indicate that the embryo will be abnormal because of the biologic factors described below.</p><p>PGS on blastocysts using contemporary methodologies will improve implantation rates since only euploid embryos are selected for transfer. However, the number of babies that could be born from embryos derived from a single cycle of ovarian stimulation will not be affected by performing PGS since PGS only selects against transfer of potentially aneuploid embryos; it does not increase the number of available euploid embryos. Additionally, testing errors inherent in any test as well as the potential for damage to the embryo from biopsy, vitrification, and warming may reduce the number of viable babies born after PGS testing of blastocysts compared with transferring untested embryos.</p><p>Mitotic (postfertilization) non-disjunction results in an embryo that contains cells with different chromosomal complements (ie, a mosaic) and is a major limitation of the predictive value of genetic screening of a small number of cells from a preimplantation embryo. A mosaic embryo containing both euploid and aneuploid cells may or may not be identified by removing and analyzing a small proportion of cells. A growing number of reports now describe ongoing pregnancies and healthy births from transfer of mosaic embryos when no &ldquo;euploid&rdquo; embryos were available for transfer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-screening/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. One report identified eight transfers of embryos diagnosed with single monosomies resulting in the delivery of three normal children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-screening/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, autosomal monosomy for chromosomes 14, 15, 16 18, 20, 21, and 22 has also been associated with severe handicaps and early death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-screening/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Even if the testing method was able to detect mosaicism, this does not necessarily mean the fetus will be mosaic or abnormal. The biopsy may remove the entire abnormal cell line from the embryo if only a small number of cells are involved, the abnormal cells may be preferentially pushed towards trophectoderm (and thus placental) differentiation rather than inner cell mass, or the aneuploid cell line may preferentially undergo cell death. The proportion of aneuploid cells that will lead to abnormal development of the embryo is unknown. Evidence from multiple studies suggests that up to half of all embryos that are aneuploid at the cleavage stage and survive to the blastocyst stage become euploid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-screening/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>]. Theories to explain this phenomenon include the failure of abnormal cell lines to proliferate, self-correction of the abnormal cell line through loss of the aneuploid chromosome, and a false-positive or incorrect result from the earlier analysis. Studies of manufactured mouse embryos with different ratios of normal and aneuploid cell lines revealed that completely normal deliveries occurred even from embryos where abnormal cells constituted &gt;50 percent of the embryo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-screening/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. Human data also showed that embryos with &lt;50 percent abnormal cells on trophectoderm biopsy had a live birth rate of 42.2 percent, similar to that in euploid embryos, and those with &ge;50 percent aneuploid cells had reduced live birth rate of 15.1 percent but still resulted in births of healthy children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-screening/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. It is important to note that no evidence of mosaicism has been found in the children born from the transfer of these mosaic embryos to date [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-screening/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].However, caution is warranted regarding the limited data available concerning the possibility of a live-born and surviving child with chromosome 13 and 18. </p><p>PGS false-positive and negative rates are difficult to determine, in part because aneuploid blastocysts are often discarded without confirmation. In addition, aneuploid blastocysts falsely classified as euploid often fail to implant and thus do not result in a fetus subsequently found to be abnormal.</p><p>Failure of amplification may occur in up to 7 percent of cells removed for screening yielding no results; however, this failure rate can be as low as 1 percent in experienced laboratories.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5938045\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL USE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary population that has been targeted for PGS is couples undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) without evidence of genetic abnormalities and thought to be at high risk of having an aneuploid embryo, such as women over age 35 years, couples who have had multiple IVF failures with morphologically normal embryos, couples who have had a previous aneuploid pregnancy, and couples who have had recurrent early pregnancy losses. </p><p>Although PGS has also been used for selection of euploid embryos in couples at low risk of having aneuploid embryos, such as women under age 35 years having IVF who would like to avoid a multiple gestation by having a single embryo transferred. In this population, there is no evidence that PGS will improve any outcome (implantation rate, live birth rate, miscarriage rate, multiple pregnancy rate) compared with transferring a single untested blastocyst.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H377515202\"><span class=\"h2\">Settings where PGS has potential clinical utility</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H377515145\"><span class=\"h3\">Planned single embryo transfer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Single embryo transfer (eSET) is desirable because it dramatically reduces the risk of multiple gestation compared with double embryo transfer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-screening/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. PGS, however, is not required for eSET and eSET without PGS has been used in good prognosis populations without a significant impact on pregnancy rates. In an early study of elective single blastocyst transfer without PGS testing, a pregnancy rate of 61 percent was achieved without a single twin pregnancy compared with a pregnancy rate of 76 percent and twin pregnancy rate of 41 percent when two blastocysts were transferred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-screening/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In other trials, rates of multiple gestation for eSET with PGS versus double embryo transfer of untested embryos were 1.6 and 47 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-screening/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. Use of eSET increases the need to identify the embryo with the best potential for resulting in pregnancy and live birth. As discussed above, morphological examination is a relatively poor predictor of embryo potential. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Strategies to control the rate of high order multiple gestation&quot;, section on 'Single embryo transfer'</a>.)</p><p>For patients over the age of 35 at the time of oocyte collection, PGS appears to increase the efficiency of IVF with eSET as the number of embryo transfer cycles can be reduced by selecting euploid embryos for transfer first; however, cumulative pregnancy rates are not higher than those after serial transfer of all available embryos. In older patients, PGS will only help those who have an excess of embryos to select the best embryos to transfer first, although it may also erroneously lead to the discard of the only normal embryo due to a false-positive result.</p><p>For young, good prognosis patients, PGS testing does not improve outcomes since the rate of aneuploidy is low and the pregnancy rate quite high with the transfer of an untested embryo. A well-designed randomized trial showed that live birth rates for &quot;eSET with PGS&quot; were equivalent to those for &quot;eSET without PGS&quot; if a second &quot;eSET without PGS&quot; was performed with a <span class=\"nowrap\">frozen/thawed</span> embryo when the first &quot;eSET without PGS&quot; did not result in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-screening/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Follow-up studies by the same group also found that delivery rates with the second transfer of untested embryos were equal to the single tested embryo transfer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-screening/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. These data illustrate the importance of accounting for the availability and subsequent transfer of cryopreserved embryos when considering PGS live birth rates and costs. Since aneuploid embryos that have little chance of implanting are discarded with PGS, the pregnancy rate per transfer is higher; however, patients who do not undergo PGS generally have more surplus embryos for freezing and later use than patients who had their embryos tested. Once all embryos (fresh and frozen) from a single oocyte retrieval procedure have been transferred, patients who do not undergo PGS have similar cumulative clinical pregnancy and live birth rates as patients who undergo PGS but also higher rates of multiple gestation (as discussed above). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H377515151\"><span class=\"h2\">Settings where clinical utility of PGS is unproven</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H377515387\"><span class=\"h3\">Recurrent in vitro fertilization implantation failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite the transfer of multiple morphologically normal embryos, some patients do not achieve pregnancy. Some studies have observed a higher rate of aneuploidy in the preimplantation embryos of these couples compared with controls, which may account for their recurrent implantation failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-screening/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Although normal embryo morphology is predictive of euploidy, aneuploid embryos can also be morphologically normal so further evaluation is needed to identify these embryos [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-screening/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Also, implantation failure may be due to a number of potential causes besides aneuploidy and abnormal morphology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-screening/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]; these possibilities are beyond the scope of this topic.</p><p>Two randomized trials evaluated the impact of PGS on pregnancy rates in IVF patients with recurrent implantation failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-screening/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. Day 3 biopsies were performed and all patients had a blastocyst transfer. In both trials, patients undergoing PGS had similar implantation rates and pregnancy rates compared with the control groups that did not undergo PGS. </p><p>There are, as of yet, no data to support a recommendation to perform PGS to enhance pregnancy rates in women with recurrent IVF implantation failure. The American Society of Reproductive Medicine does not support the use of preimplantation aneuploidy screening to increase live birth rates in all women with previous implantation failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-screening/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. However, it may be reasonable in good prognosis patients who have failed multiple prior embryo transfers and have a large number of high quality of embryos [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-screening/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5938611\"><span class=\"h3\">Advanced maternal age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The increasing prevalence of infertility and miscarriage with advancing maternal age is attributed, in large part, to the increasing prevalence of aneuploidy with advancing age, including more complex aneuploidies (eg, involving two or more chromosomes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-screening/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. However, biopsy of one or more cells at the blastocyst stage is not representative of the entire trophectoderm, large biopsies may reduce implantation potential, trophectoderm ploidy does not reliably represent the inner cell mass, and ploidy may self-correct after the blastocyst stage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-screening/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Since women of advanced age are more likely than younger women to have few or no euploid embryos, choosing PGS can limit their opportunity for transfer of mosaic embryos that can result in live birth of euploid infants. In addition, since most abnormal embryos will not continue to develop or implant if transferred into the uterus or would result in an early miscarriage without need for medical intervention, PGS to identify abnormal embryos is not likely to result in an increase in the take-home baby rate and may prolong the time to conceive a pregnancy if patients are undergoing multiple cycles to have adequate numbers of embryos to perform PGS (ie, embryo banking). It can, however, reduce miscarriage rates. </p><p>We believe that available evidence does not support the use of PGS in older women undergoing IVF to increase the probability of a live birth. The American Society of Reproductive Medicine does not support the use of preimplantation aneuploidy screening to increase live birth rates in women of advanced maternal age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-screening/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. </p><p>Early randomized trials evaluating the utility of PGS on day 3 embryos for improving live birth rates in women of advanced maternal age have not shown a benefit. These trials used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), which has limited accuracy in this setting (ie, incomplete chromosome analysis and mosaicism) (see <a href=\"#H5938038\" class=\"local\">'Limitations of PGS'</a> above). In a 2011 meta-analysis including nine randomized trials, PGS using FISH reduced the live birth rate after IVF for women of advanced maternal age (risk difference -0.08, 95% CI -0.13 to -0.03; live birth rate 26 percent after IVF without PGS, 13 to 23 percent with PGS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-screening/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Although PGS selected euploid embryos, potentially resulting in higher implantation rates and pregnancy rates per transfer, pregnancy rates per woman or per started cycle were lower since fewer embryos were available for transfer and fewer transfers were performed.</p><p>In a trial of PGS by comparative genomic hybridization on day 3 embryos versus blastocyst transfer alone in women ages 38 to 41 years with at least five metaphase II oocytes, both groups had similar cumulative delivery rates per patient by six months after trial closure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-screening/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. PGS resulted in a higher rate of delivery from the first embryo transfer (53 versus 24 percent) and overall fewer embryo transfers per live birth (mean 1.8 versus 3.7) because of lower miscarriage rates (3 versus 39 percent). However, fewer cycles in the PGS group resulted in embryo transfer (68 versus 91 percent). The authors concluded that PGS was advantageous in women of advanced maternal age because&nbsp;it reduced the emotional burden of miscarriage and the time from initiation of IVF to live birth. Even though PGS resulted in fewer cycles reaching embryo transfer, patients in whom all embryos were chromosomally abnormal avoided the psychological, physical, and economic burden of unsuccessful embryo transfers (miscarriage, implantation failure). However, the possibility that an embryo considered abnormal by PGS testing due to a false-positive error could have resulted in a healthy child had it been transferred without testing is a real possibility, and patients with limited numbers of embryos must be made aware of this prior to testing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H120201020\"><span class=\"h3\">Recurrent early pregnancy loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of conceptions that end in spontaneous miscarriage and are successfully karyotyped demonstrate a chromosomal abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-screening/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. Embryos from some women with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) show a high rate of aneuploidy regardless of maternal age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-screening/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. Couples with RPL often have no difficulty conceiving a pregnancy and might have an overly receptive endometrial environment allowing abnormal embryos to implant. IVF with PGS has been proposed to select euploid embryos for transfer, which might increase the implantation rate, lower the spontaneous loss rate, and thus improve pregnancy outcome in couples who have experienced RPL and have a history of proven aneuploid abortuses. For women with RPL who have had proven euploid miscarriages, IVF with PGS is unlikely to be of benefit. </p><p>No randomized trials have been performed, but findings from some observational studies have provided some evidence that pregnancy rates among RPL patients who undergo PGS can be improved to rates comparable to those in control populations (eg, women undergoing PGD for sex-linked disorders, IVF because of male factor infertility) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-screening/abstract/49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-51</a>]. However, since the probability of subsequent successful pregnancy in patients with RPL without intervention is already high, approaching 70 percent, these studies do not prove the benefit of PGS in management of RPL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-screening/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. Randomized trials using contemporary blastocyst culture and trophectoderm biopsy techniques in patients with recurrent aneuploidy pregnancy losses have not been performed.</p><p>PGS may reduce the probability of miscarriage in patients with recurrent pregnancy loss as well as the sequelae of miscarriage and uterine trauma; however, there is no evidence that PGS will increase the eventual take-home baby rate in women with recurrent pregnancy loss.

One blastomere is removed from a day 3 (approximately 8 cells) embryo or multiple cells (5 to 10 cells) are removed from a blastocyst on day 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> 6. The goal is to identify de-novo aneuploidy in embryo(s) of couples known, or presumed, to be chromosomally normal to allow selection of only those embryos with normal karyotypes for transfer. (See <a href=\"#H120198825\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blastocyst trophectoderm biopsy with whole genome amplification and microarray analysis (comparative genomic hybridization or single nucleotide polymorphism) or next generation sequencing is the preferred technique. PGS using day 3 blastomere biopsy and fluorescence in situ hybridization decreases the chances of live birth. (See <a href=\"#H5938038\" class=\"local\">'Limitations of PGS'</a> above and <a href=\"#H225572213\" class=\"local\">'Array comparative genomic hybridization and single nucleotide polymorphism arrays'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major clinical utility of PGS is that multiple gestation rates can be significantly reduced without reducing delivery rates if a euploid result leads to single embryo transfer rather than double embryo transfer. However, studies evaluating the transfer of one fresh blastocyst and, if no pregnancy occurs, one <span class=\"nowrap\">frozen/thawed</span> blastocyst report the same success rates as transferring a single blastocyst after PGS. (See <a href=\"#H377515202\" class=\"local\">'Settings where PGS has potential clinical utility'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mosaicism, a common finding in preimplantation embryos, will limit the usefulness of PGS in identifying euploid embryos for transfer or selecting against aneuploidy embryos. (See <a href=\"#H5938038\" class=\"local\">'Limitations of PGS'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PGS should <strong>not</strong> be performed to select the best embryos for transfer in couples with no known chromosomal or genetic abnormality. There is no high-quality evidence that PGS improves cumulative live birth rates in these couples, including those of advanced maternal age and those who have experienced in vitro fertilization implantation failure or recurrent pregnancy loss. (See <a href=\"#H377515151\" class=\"local\">'Settings where clinical utility of PGS is unproven'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with karyotypically abnormal miscarriages, PGS may decrease the risk of subsequent miscarriage, but there is no evidence that it will increase the probability of having a liveborn child.
