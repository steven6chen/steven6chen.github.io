(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of action'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antenatal corticosteroid therapy reduces the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, sepsis, and neonatal mortality by approximately 50 percent. These effects are not limited by gender or race; efficacy in multiple gestations is unclear, as high-quality data are sparse. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Evidence of short-term clinical efficacy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10508416\" class=\"local\">'Multiple gestation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given these benefits, we recommend administration of antenatal corticosteroids to pregnant woman who are at 23+0 to 33+6 weeks of gestation and at increased risk of preterm delivery within the next seven days (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). In our practice, we restrict administration of the first course of antenatal corticosteroids to women who rupture membranes or are receiving tocolysis for active preterm labor, or in whom delivery for maternal or fetal indications is anticipated within the next seven days. This approach minimizes the need for salvage (rescue, booster) therapy while allowing most patients to receive a course of antenatal corticosteroids prior to preterm delivery. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A course of antenatal corticosteroids consists of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">betamethasone</a> suspension 12 mg intramuscularly every 24 hours for two doses <strong>or</strong> four doses of 6 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> intramuscularly 12 hours apart. We prefer betamethasone over dexamethasone. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Choice of drug and initial dose'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Observational data suggest neonatal benefits begin to accrue within a few hours of corticosteroid administration. Maximum efficacy appears to occur when delivery occurs two to seven days after administration of the first dose of antenatal corticosteroids. Efficacy is incomplete &lt;24 hours from administration and appears to decline after 7 days. (See <a href=\"#H2439085154\" class=\"local\">'Timing before delivery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We consider approximately 23+0 weeks of gestation the lower limit for administration of antenatal corticosteroids since only a few primitive alveoli are present below this gestational age. Earlier administration in the 22<sup>nd</sup> week is reasonable if aggressive neonatal intervention is planned after thorough counseling about the limit of viability. (See <a href=\"#H2439085631\" class=\"local\">'22+0 to 33+6 weeks'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contemporary obstetric practice in the United States, women delivered at 34+0 to 38+6 weeks of gestation for an obstetric indication are increasingly delivered without amniocentesis to test for fetal lung maturity. The following approach reflects our concern that widespread use of antenatal steroids at &ge;34+0 weeks will result in treatment of many pregnancies that will not benefit or will derive only a modest clinical benefit, while exposing them to the theoretical long-term hazards of steroid administration, particularly adverse neurodevelopment outcome in offspring (see <a href=\"#H2439085123\" class=\"local\">'34+0 or more weeks'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Potential long-term effects in children and adults'</a> above).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women scheduled for cesarean delivery at 34+0 to 36+6 weeks, we suggest a first course of antenatal corticosteroids (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Some clinicians and patients may choose not to use steroids after 34+0 weeks of gestation, given uncertainly in the balance between benefits and risks at &ge;34+0 weeks. Families should be informed regarding potential benefits and risks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women at 34+0 to 36+6 weeks who have already received a course of antenatal corticosteroids, or who are expected to deliver vaginally, or whose likelihood of delivery within the next seven days is uncertain, we suggest not administering a course of antenatal corticosteroids (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Repeat courses of steroids have not be studied at &ge;34+0 weeks, transient tachypnea of the newborn is less common after labor and vaginal birth, and most women with threatened preterm labor do not deliver preterm. This is a controversial area and some national obstetrical organizations have taken a more liberal approach to steroid administration at this gestational age. (See <a href=\"#H2366789110\" class=\"local\">'Other approaches'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We also suggest not administering steroids to women undergoing scheduled cesarean delivery at &ge;37+0 weeks (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The overall risk of neonatal respiratory problems at this gestational age is low and illness is rarely serious. Families should be informed regarding potential benefits and risks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The absence of consistent and long-term data precludes making a strong recommendation for the number of courses that are safe for the fetus, the appropriate time interval between courses, the optimal dose for repeated courses of therapy, or the full ramifications of the single course approach to therapy. Given the potential for harm from repeated courses of antenatal corticosteroid therapy:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest a single course of salvage (rescue, booster) therapy only if the patient is clinically estimated to be at high risk of delivery within the next seven days, more than two weeks have elapsed since the initial course of antenatal corticosteroid therapy, and the gestational age at administration of the initial course was &le;28 weeks of gestation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We also suggest that providers who elect to give salvage (rescue, booster) therapy use one dose of 12 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">betamethasone</a> and limit treatment to this one additional dose (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). One dose appears to be effective and may minimize complications related to steroid use; however, a two dose course is also reasonable. No more than one salvage dose or course is recommended over a single pregnancy. Patients should be informed of potential adverse effects.
