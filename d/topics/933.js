Weakness results from an antibody-mediated immunological attack directed at acetylcholine receptors (or receptor-associated proteins) in the postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction.</p><p>Anesthetic concerns for patients with MG include the interactions among the disease, the disease treatment, and the medications used for anesthesia, particularly neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs). Patients with MG are unpredictably sensitive to nondepolarizing NMBAs and are resistant to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a>, a depolarizing NMBA.</p><p>Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a rare autoimmune disorder of the neuromuscular junction, with antibodies directed against the presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels. It is often associated with an underlying malignancy, most commonly small cell lung cancer, though it is also associated with other autoimmune processes. Patients with LEMS are very sensitive to both depolarizing and nondepolarizing NMBAs.</p><p>This topic will discuss the anesthetic management of patients with MG and LEMS. Diagnosis, clinical manifestations, and management of MG and LEMS are discussed in detail separately.

The timing and dose of medication is individualized based on the patient&rsquo;s symptoms. The starting dose is often 30 mg orally (PO), with the dose then titrated to effect.

The plans for labor analgesia and anesthesia for potential instrumented or operative delivery should be determined well before the patient presents in labor. Like other surgical patients, obstetric patients should be assessed for the degree of bulbar dysfunction and respiratory muscle weakness, and also for the predicted ability to tolerate midthoracic levels of regional anesthetic block. Anesthesia concerns specific to labor and delivery include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Labor analgesia</strong> &ndash; Most patients require some degree of analgesia during labor. Neuraxial analgesia is the preferred method of pain control during labor for patients with MG because it reduces or eliminates the need for systemic opioid administration, thereby minimizing respiratory depression for patients with respiratory compromise. Excellent labor analgesia can be achieved with low levels of very dilute local anesthetic and opioid medications, which result in a minimal, if any, degree of motor block. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuraxial-analgesia-for-labor-and-delivery-including-instrumented-delivery#H535011679\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuraxial analgesia for labor and delivery (including instrumented delivery)&quot;, section on 'Neuraxial analgesia drug choice'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Instrumented delivery</strong> &ndash; The first stage of labor depends on uterine smooth muscle and is unaffected by MG. However, the second stage of labor requires the use of striated muscle, which may weaken, increasing the need for instrumented delivery. Neuraxial analgesia can be augmented to provide adequate lumbosacral levels of anesthesia for forceps- or vacuum-assisted delivery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cesarean section</strong> &ndash; While neuraxial anesthesia (ie, spinal and epidural) is used most commonly for cesarean section, patients with MG may not tolerate the high level of block required. Neuraxial anesthesia results in both sensory and motor block; for cesarean section, a midthoracic level of anesthesia is required, which often affects the accessory muscles of respiration. For patients with significant bulbar or respiratory compromise, general anesthesia should be performed for cesarean section.</p><p/><p>Anticholinesterases, used for treatment for patients with MG, may theoretically impair the hydrolysis of ester local anesthetics and result in prolonged block. The amide class of local anesthetic should therefore be used for patients who take anticholinesterase medication.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H697570705\"><span class=\"h1\">LAMBERT-EATON MYASTHENIC SYNDROME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a rare disorder of the neuromuscular junction, much less common than myasthenia gravis (MG).

Myasthenic crisis requires endotracheal intubation and ventilation, intensive care, and often rapid immunomodulating therapy. It should be distinguished from cholinergic crisis, which is the result of excessive administration of anticholinesterase medication and may also require ventilatory support.

The degree of bulbar and respiratory dysfunction should be assessed, as well as the ability to tolerate a midthoracic level of neuraxial anesthesia.
