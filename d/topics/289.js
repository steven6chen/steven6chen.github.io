The estimated frequency of acute liver failure (ALF) in all age groups in the United States is about 17 cases per 100,000 population per year, but the frequency in children is unknown. PALF accounts for 10 to 15 percent of pediatric liver transplants performed in the United States annually.</p><p>PALF is a rapidly evolving clinical condition. There are no adequately powered studies to inform diagnostic algorithms, to assess markers of disease severity and trajectory, and to guide decisions about liver transplant. The clinician must construct an individualized diagnostic approach and management strategy. Management requires a multidisciplinary team involving the hepatologist, critical care specialist, and liver transplant surgeon.</p><p>Management of PALF and its complications in children are discussed here. An organized approach to diagnosing the cause of PALF is presented separately.

The first step in management of PALF is to maintain a high index of suspicion because PALF can present in a child at any age and in any clinical setting. PALF should be considered when a child presents with the acute onset of jaundice, or is acutely ill, with or without jaundice or neurological dysfunction. When such patients are encountered, initial laboratory testing should include measurement of serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT), total and direct bilirubin, prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR), and glucose.</p><p>Next steps that should be taken when evidence of PALF is recognized will depend on the clinical setting:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-hospital setting &ndash; Transfer to the nearest emergency room.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Emergency room or hospital ward:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Establish an intravenous line to monitor and maintain glucose levels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Initiate contact and likely transfer to a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with experience in the diagnosis and management of PALF including emergent pediatric liver transplantation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) &ndash; Consultations will be dictated by the clinical circumstances; initial consultations should include specialists in pediatric gastroenterology <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hepatology.</p><p/><p>Management of PALF requires initial admission to a PICU in most cases, given the potential for rapid clinical deterioration and need for a team of pediatric specialists in critical care, <span class=\"nowrap\">gastroenterology/hepatology,</span> liver transplantation, and skilled nurses and ancillary personnel. This will allow for close monitoring of the patient, particularly for changes in mental status. Careful and frequent bedside assessment by an experienced nurse or clinician is essential, and cannot be replaced by indirect monitors such as a cardiorespiratory and oxygen saturation monitor. Care givers must carefully examine the child multiple times during the day and night to assess evidence of changing mental status or hepatic encephalopathy, increased respiratory effort, changing heart rate or changes in blood pressure that might be signs of infection, increasing cerebral edema, or electrolyte imbalance. Fluid balance (input and output) should be strictly monitored.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24093566\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory monitoring should include a complete blood count, electrolytes, renal function tests, glucose, calcium, phosphorous, ammonia, PT, INR, total and direct bilirubin, and blood cultures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The frequency of laboratory monitoring should be at least daily, but multiple tests obtained regularly throughout the day may be necessary to monitor the dynamic changes that can occur in PALF.</p><p>For measurement of ammonia, arterial samples are ideal but not always clinically practical. For children with stage 0 to II hepatic encephalopathy (HE), ammonia can generally be monitored with venous samples obtained from a free-flowing catheter, and promptly placed on ice and transported to the laboratory. Children with more advanced HE often require elective intubation and ventilatory support accompanied by placement of an arterial catheter. If available, ammonia samples should be obtained from the arterial catheter, but the arterial catheter should not be placed solely for ammonia testing.</p><p>Laboratory studies for diagnosing the cause of the PALF are also important, and should be planned based on the patient's age and presentation, prioritizing those diagnoses that may be amenable to specific treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-liver-failure-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation#H6018198\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute liver failure in children: Etiology and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Laboratory testing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24093585\"><span class=\"h2\">Fluids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the child is hemodynamically unstable, fluid resuscitation and pressor support is needed to stabilize cardiovascular status. However, patients with PALF are sensitive to fluid volume and can develop pulmonary and peripheral edema if they receive excessive fluid. Therefore, as a general rule, intravenous and oral fluid intake should be modestly restricted for most patients with PALF. An effort should be made to restrict total daily fluid intake (including medications and blood products) to between 90 and 95 percent of the maintenance fluid requirement.</p><p>Serum glucose should be maintained between 90 and 110 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> as both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia may affect critical homeostatic mechanisms and liver regeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A central venous catheter may be required if concentrations of intravenous glucose over 12.5 percent are needed to maintain the serum glucose while restricting fluid volume. Adjustment in fluid rates is based upon the clinical conditions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18340153\"><span class=\"h1\">CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18340160\"><span class=\"h2\">Encephalopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a neuropsychiatric syndrome associated with hepatic dysfunction. In a large registry of patients with pediatric acute liver failure (PALF), some degree of encephalopathy was present on admission in 50 percent of patients, and developed within the next seven days in an additional 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>HE is determined by serial clinical evaluations of behavior, cognition, neurological examination, and, occasionally, electroencephalogram (EEG) to categorize the patient into one of five clinical stages of encephalopathy, ranging from stage 0 (minimal or no evidence of neurological dysfunction) to stage IV (coma) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Stages of encephalopathy are defined slightly differently in infants and children up to 48 months of age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F83748\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83748 \">table 2</a>) as compared with older children and adults (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F62922\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62922 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F70740\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70740 \">figure 1</a>). Clinical staging of HE was originally developed to assess patients with cirrhosis rather than acute liver failure (ALF). Nonetheless, the scoring system has been found to have important clinical and prognostic implications in adults and children with ALF. The pathogenesis and diagnosis of HE in adults is discussed in separate topic reviews. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatic-encephalopathy-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatic encephalopathy in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatic-encephalopathy-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatic encephalopathy: Pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The role of other modalities to assess neurological function, such as visual evoked potentials, transcranial Doppler, cerebral near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), and biomarkers, in the detection of HE is unclear at the present time<em>. </em>While neurologic morbidity remains a major determinant of outcome following pediatric ALF, further studies are needed to improve early detection of neurologic injury, standardize management of seizures and HE, and to determine whether such interventions improve outcomes.</p><p>Hepatic encephalopathy is not always clinically apparent in infants and young children. Distinguishing hepatic based encephalopathy from other causes of an altered mental status such as sepsis, hypotension, electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, anxiety, or &quot;intensive care unit (ICU) psychosis&quot; is difficult for all age groups. Hyperammonemia plays a central role in the development of HE in most cases. Although a specific level of ammonia does not result in a predictable degree of encephalopathy, an ammonia level at or above 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L</span> has been associated with increased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Initial treatment of HE includes minimizing excess stimulation, head elevated at a 20 to 30 degree angle, treating suspected sepsis, and, if possible, removing sedative medications that might affect mental status. For patients with progressive HE associated with hyperammonemia, we suggest medical therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactulose-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lactulose</a>, which is used empirically although there is only weak evidence to suggest that it is effective. The starting dose of lactulose is 0.4 to 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> every two hours by mouth or via nasogastric tube, with the dose adjusted as needed to produce two to three soft stools daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Bowel &quot;decontamination&quot; with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifaximin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">rifaximin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neomycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">neomycin</a> can be used as a second-tier treatment, but ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity are potential risks when neomycin is used. Restriction of protein intake to no more than 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day</span> may help reduce ammonia production. Ammonia scavengers used to treat patients with urea cycle defects have not been adequately studied and are rarely used in acute liver failure (ALF). In a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled study in adults with ALF, the ammonia scavenger L-ornithine L-aspartate did not lower ammonia or improve survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. There is little evidence to support the use of enteral formulas designed for hepatic disease (see <a href=\"#H18340253\" class=\"local\">'Nutrition'</a> below). Medical management of HE has not been studied in children, and clinical practice has been extrapolated from the clinical experience in adults. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatic-encephalopathy-in-adults-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatic encephalopathy in adults: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some patients with HE develop a clinically important increase in intracranial pressure, which can have devastating consequences. Direct monitoring of intracranial pressure is the most sensitive and specific procedure to use when compared with less invasive neuroradiographic procedures, such as cranial computed tomography (CT) or transcranial ultrasonography. (See <a href=\"#H18340167\" class=\"local\">'Cerebral edema'</a> below.)</p><p>Children with ALF may experience generalized or focal seizures, or nonconvulsive (electrographic) seizures (NCS). In most cases, treatment begins with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenytoin</a>, but practices are variable and there is no definitive standard of care. For seizures which are refractory to phenytoin, therapeutic options may include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">midazolam</a> infusion, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenobarbital</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levetiracetam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">levetiracetam</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topiramate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">topiramate</a>. The selection of drug depends on the patient's mental status, physiologic stability, availability of EEG monitoring to titrate drug infusions, and institutional experience.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18340167\"><span class=\"h2\">Cerebral edema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cerebral edema is a life threatening complication of ALF. It may lead to ischemic and hypoxic brain injury, or brainstem herniation and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. It occurs most commonly in those with advanced hepatic encephalopathy (stage III or IV) and can progress rapidly. Detection of cerebral edema in the early stages is difficult, because noninvasive monitoring with clinical assessment or radiographic studies lacks sensitivity. The most sensitive measure of intracranial pressure (ICP) requires surgical placement of an ICP monitor. The decision about initiating ICP monitoring must balance the need for constant monitoring in an intubated and comatose patient against the risk of bleeding. Decisions to proceed should be made with consultation from specialists in pediatric neurology and neurosurgery. In general, ICP monitoring is reserved for patients with Stage III or IV encephalopathy. Reported risks include bleeding in 10 to 20 percent of patients, although the amount of bleeding is often minimal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Once the ICP monitor is in place and properly functioning, it can be a valuable tool to continually assess response to ICP and its treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The ICP monitor is also felt to be valuable during surgical procedures, including liver transplantation, to gauge fluid and medical management of the unconscious patient. Monitoring of intracranial pressure in children remains controversial due to associated complications of the procedure and lack of evidence that monitoring improves survival. The indications, types, and complications of ICP pressure monitoring in adults are discussed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-liver-failure-in-adults-management-and-prognosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute liver failure in adults: Management and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Intracranial pressure monitoring'</a>.)</p><p>The pathogenesis of cerebral edema is complex and likely involves the interaction among ammonia, cerebral blood flow, and inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Elevated levels of ammonia are generated as a consequence of the failing liver, which leads to increased intracerebral concentrations. Ammonia enters the astrocyte, which is rich in glutamine synthetase. Conversion of ammonia and glutamate to glutamine, a potent intracellular osmolyte, creates an osmotic gradient that favors astrocyte swelling and contributes to cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension. Changes in the inflammatory milieu, sepsis, fluid or blood product administration, and other factors can result in a sudden and often unanticipated increase in intracranial pressure.</p><p>Management of cerebral edema involves meticulous supportive care to maintain the following goals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oxygen saturation above 95 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Total daily fluid between 85 and 90 percent of maintenance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintain a diastolic pressure &gt;40 mmHg (except in infants).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimize agitation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Head elevation of 20 to 30&deg;.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consideration of empiric broad spectrum antibiotics to minimize the development of bacterial infection &ndash; In children with PALF, infection sometimes presents with neurological deterioration, rather than typical symptoms of infection. (See <a href=\"#H18340239\" class=\"local\">'Infectious'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Therapies targeted specifically to improve cerebral edema have not met scientific rigor. Common strategies include hypertonic saline to maintain serum sodium between 145 and 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">mannitol</a> to maintain serum osmolarity between 300 and 320 <span class=\"nowrap\">mOsm/L</span> to create a more favorable osmotic gradient to extract water from the brain. Mannitol is also used as a rescue medication for clinical signs of uncal herniation, which includes pupillary dilatation not responsive to light, bradycardia, and hypertension. Hypothermia has been used in adults with acute liver failure with some success, but has not been studied in children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-liver-failure-in-adults-management-and-prognosis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute liver failure in adults: Management and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Treatment of intracranial pressure elevation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18340174\"><span class=\"h1\">HEMATOLOGIC</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18340182\"><span class=\"h2\">Coagulopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prothrombin time (PT) and international normalization ratio (INR) are used to assess the severity of liver injury in the setting of acute liver failure (ALF), because these tests reflect hepatic production of clotting factors, particularly factors V and VII, which have the shortest half-lives. However, the PT and INR are not good markers for the risk of bleeding in patients with ALF. This is because ALF reduces both procoagulant proteins (eg, factor V, VII, X, and fibrinogen) and anticoagulant proteins (eg, antithrombin, protein C, and protein S) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-management/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemostatic-abnormalities-in-patients-with-liver-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemostatic abnormalities in patients with liver disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This balanced reduction in the procoagulant and anticoagulant proteins may account for the relative infrequency of clinically important bleeding in the pediatric acute liver failure (PALF) patient in the absence of a provocative event such as infection or increased portal hypertension. A single dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-k-phytonadione-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vitamin K</a> should be administered once to initially assess response of the coagulation profile. However, daily administration of vitamin K is unnecessary. Efforts to &quot;correct&quot; the <span class=\"nowrap\">PT/INR</span> with plasma or other procoagulation products such as recombinant Factor VII should be avoided, unless the patient is actively bleeding or an invasive surgical procedure is anticipated. Similarly, we transfuse platelets only if there is evidence of bleeding, or if a surgical procedure is planned in a patient with very low platelet count.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18340189\"><span class=\"h2\">Aplastic anemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bone marrow failure, characterized by a spectrum of features ranging from mild pancytopenia to aplastic anemia, occurs in a significant minority of children with ALF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Case series of plasma exchange in children or adults with acute liver failure (ALF) have demonstrated improvement in coagulation profiles, vasopressor requirements, and encephalopathy grade scores, but not in patient survival and neurological outcome. An exception is that for patients with ALF due to Wilson disease, plasma exchange can be valuable because it rapidly removes large amounts of copper (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wilson-disease-treatment-and-prognosis#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wilson disease: Treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Acute liver failure'</a>).

Furthermore, a randomized, doubly masked, controlled trial in PALF demonstrated that intravenous N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was not beneficial in children with non-acetaminophen-induced ALF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-management/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Among these, only PELD is specific to the pediatric age group, but it was developed for chronic rather than acute liver disease, and includes factors such as growth failure that are less relevant to prognosis in acute liver failure (ALF). KCHC is commonly used to predict prognosis and need for liver transplantation in adults with ALF, and is stratified by whether the ALF is caused by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a> toxicity. However, KCHC are not useful in PALF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-management/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

While this represents an improvement compared with the other scoring systems mentioned above, LIU is not sufficient to make critical decisions about liver transplantation. We believe the ideal scoring system should reflect the dynamic nature of PALF and incorporate periodic clinical changes into deriving the likelihood of death or survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18340290\"><span class=\"h1\">LIVER TRANSPLANT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18340298\"><span class=\"h2\">Liver transplant decisions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the era before liver transplantation (LT) was available, the natural history of pediatric acute liver failure (PALF) was for children to either survive or die. LT interrupts the natural course of PALF, and can save the life of a patient with acute liver failure (ALF) if he or she has a condition that is not amenable to treatment or fails to respond to treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F83763\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83763 \">figure 2</a>). However, because the cause of PALF often is not known, and the course of PALF is difficult to predict, it is likely that some patients may receive LT in situations in which spontaneous recovery may have occurred.</p><p>LT decisions are difficult because of uncertainty regarding the patient's outcome without transplant, the potential morbidity and mortality of the transplant procedure, and the limited number of organs available. Moreover, long-term outcomes following LT for PALF are less favorable as compared with LT for chronic liver diseases such as biliary atresia. This is likely due to multiple factors, including the severity of illness at the time of LT, and the possibility that LT was performed in circumstances in which death was inevitable regardless of LT. When living donor LT is considered, the decision also includes consideration of potential risks to the donor.</p><p>As discussed above, none of the scoring systems are adequate to direct decisions about LT for patients with PALF. A more reliable modeling scheme is needed to readily and effectively distinguish the patient who would die from the one who would survive without LT and recognize when it would be futile to proceed with LT. Until then, the best solution is a global clinical assessment by a team of clinicians with experience in PALF and LT, incorporating the prognosis associated with the cause of the ALF, and the patient's dynamic course, based on repeated assessments of the probability of survival with native liver from one time interval to the next.</p><p>LT decisions are particularly challenging for patients with PALF caused by a mitochondrial disease. Multisystem mitochondrial dysfunction is a contraindication to liver transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-management/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, patients who do not have extrahepatic manifestations of disease may have isolated hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction and could be candidates for liver transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-management/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Unfortunately, multisystem involvement may not be apparent at the time of LT, placing the child at risk for developing symptoms in the future. Moreover, patients whose ALF was triggered by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">valproate</a> have a very poor prognosis after LT, due to a high likelihood of mitochondrial disease (especially <em>POLG</em> mutations), and extrahepatic disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-management/abstract/24,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26,27</a>].

Organ allocation in the United States is managed by United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), and is based largely on disease severity scores for adults (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease [MELD]) and children (Pediatric End Stage Liver Disease [PELD]) to support organ allocation for patients with chronic liver disease. PELD is calculated by UNOS or by using a calculator (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-peld-score-for-end-stage-liver-disease-patients-less-than-12-years-old\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). MELD is used for patients 12 years and older and is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>PELD and MELD are used to allocate organs for patients with chronic liver disease; they were not designed for use in ALF. The urgency of liver transplantation for PALF is typically not reflected by their <span class=\"nowrap\">PELD/MELD</span> score. Patients with ALF and in need of liver transplantation are given priority over those listed with a <span class=\"nowrap\">PELD/MELD</span> score and are listed as Status 1A, the category with the highest priority status. Status 1A is reserved for children in an intensive care unit (ICU) in one of four diagnostic categories, including fulminant liver failure. The three other diagnostic categories qualifying for Status 1A are primary graft non-function following liver transplantation, hepatic artery thrombosis, and acute decompensated Wilson disease.</p><p>To qualify for Status 1A for fulminant liver failure, UNOS uses the following criteria:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Onset of hepatic encephalopathy within eight weeks of the first symptoms of liver disease in the absence of preexisting liver disease, AND one of the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ventilator dependence</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Need for dialysis, continuous venovenous hemofiltration, or continuous venovenous hemodialysis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>INR &gt;2.0</p><p/><p>Children who are classified as Status 1A require reassessment of their listing status after seven days. At any time, the child can be removed from the transplantation list if <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> becomes too ill to undergo transplantation or recovers to a point that transplantation is not necessary. If the child is still on the list after seven days, options would be to continue to list the patient as Status 1A by providing supportive clinical information, remove the child from the list, or &quot;demote&quot; the urgency by changing the listing status from Status 1A to the calculated PELD score.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18340312\"><span class=\"h2\">Types of grafts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LT has improved overall survival for children with ALF. Because the supply of appropriately sized organs from deceased donors is inadequate, some children with PALF die while waiting for LT, and pretransplant mortality is worse than for patients with chronic liver failure. As a result, technical variants to whole grafts such as split and living donors have been introduced.</p><p>In a report of LT for PALF from centers in the United States and Canada, deceased-donor whole livers were used in 46 percent of transplants, split or cut-down grafts were used in 38 percent, and grafts from living donors were used in 14 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-management/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Outcomes for patients receiving donor or split liver grafts were not different from those receiving whole liver grafts. However, in a separate study that focused on patients with ALF and concurrent multiorgan failure, living donor LT was associated with improved 30-day and 6-month survival compared with recipients of a deceased donor liver allograft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-management/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Improved outcome for patients receiving a living donor LT is likely related to a reduced cold ischemia time and wait time, resulting in a more expeditious time to transplant for these seriously ill children. While most patients are maintained on long-term immunosuppression after a living donor LT, some pediatric recipients of parental living donor liver transplantations are eventually able to withdraw from immunosuppression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=living-donor-liver-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Living donor liver transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Auxiliary liver transplantation is an alternative approach that consists of placement of a graft adjacent to the patient's native liver (auxiliary heterotopic liver transplantation) or in the hepatic bed after a portion of the native liver (auxiliary orthotopic liver transplantation) has been removed. This technique has been used as a &quot;bridge&quot; to provide need time for the native liver to regenerate, but challenges remain as to the timing for withdrawal of immunosuppression, which leads to involution of the transplanted graft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-management/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Hepatocyte transplantation may serve as a bridge to transplant or, perhaps, a &quot;cure&quot; for some children with metabolic diseases. It has been used in a small number of children with ALF. However, technical challenges as well as lack of a readily available source for hepatocytes have limited the opportunity for this procedure at most centers.

More recently, with improvements in management of critically ill children, coupled with a more lenient definition of pediatric acute liver failure (PALF), outcomes have improved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-management/abstract/1-3,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,33,34</a>]. However, it should be noted that all current studies of outcomes are affected by decisions about liver transplantation (LT), because LT interrupts the natural course of PALF. Some children who receive LT may have recovered spontaneously, and some die as a consequence of LT rather than of the underlying PALF. Patient outcome depends on a number of factors including the etiology, disease severity, supportive management, and treatment. However, outcomes vary among children with seemingly similar etiology, disease severity, and treatment. Additional factors are likely involved to explain these variations perhaps including the inflammatory milieu, end-organ damage, immune activation, and potential for liver regeneration.</p><p>Data from the Pediatric Acute Liver Failure Study Group (PALFSG) in North America and Europe revealed that 21-day outcome varied by diagnosis, age, and degree of encephalopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-management/abstract/1,33,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,33,35</a>]. Spontaneous survival (survival with the native liver) varies with the underlying cause of the PALF. Spontaneous survival was highest amongst those with liver failure due to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a> (94 percent), and was lower for those with liver failure due to metabolic disease (44 percent), for those with non-acetaminophen drug-induced disease (41 percent), and for those with an indeterminate diagnosis (45 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. For children with an established diagnosis, between 20 to 33 percent received a LT; and of those with acetaminophen-induced PALF, only 2 percent received an LT. In comparison, among patients with a diagnosis of indeterminant PALF, 46 percent underwent LT. Therefore, children who do not have a specific diagnosis are more likely to receive an LT. The major causes of death for children with PALF who do not receive LT are multiorgan system failure, cerebral edema and herniation, and sepsis.</p><p>In the PALFSG cohort, patients with higher stages of encephalopathy had lower spontaneous survival, as might be expected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-management/abstract/1,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,35</a>]. Excluding patients with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a> toxicity, spontaneous survival was 79 percent among those who never developed encephalopathy, versus 45 percent among those with encephalopathy at study enrollment, and 25 percent among those who developed encephalopathy during the first seven days after enrollment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-management/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, it is notable that 4 percent of those who never developed encephalopathy died, and 17 percent had LT, suggesting that hepatic encephalopathy is not a reliable predictor of outcome. PALF participants whose encephalopathy was observed to either progress from one stage to another or persist during the seven days encephalopathy was recorded had a high likelihood of receiving a liver transplant. Patients presenting without hepatic encephalopathy were typically younger and less likely to have presented with fever or seizures.</p><p>Both early and late graft loss and death is higher among children who undergo LT for ALF than for those with chronic liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-management/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Reasons for these findings are uncertain, but one possibility includes immune dysregulation that may be associated with PALF, which could lead to increased susceptibility to infection or graft rejection. Among patients undergoing LT for PALF, overall survival rates are 74 percent at one year, and 69 percent at four years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-management/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>A cross-sectional analysis of neuropsychological functioning and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes among long-term PALF survivors demonstrate an average intellectual quotient (IQ) and visual spatial ability, but impairments in motor skills, attention, executive function, HRQOL, and fatigue were noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-management/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

Serial clinical evaluations of behavior, cognition, neurological examination, and electroencephalogram (EEG) are important to assess the presence and progress of HE and possible onset of cerebral edema. We suggest that patients with HE be treated initially with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactulose-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lactulose</a>, although the evidence to support this approach is weak (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H18340160\" class=\"local\">'Encephalopathy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of cerebral edema requires meticulous supportive care, sometimes guided by surgical placement of an intracranial pressure monitor. (See <a href=\"#H18340167\" class=\"local\">'Cerebral edema'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prothrombin time (PT) and international normalization ratio (INR) are used to assess the severity of liver injury in the setting of PALF because these tests reflect hepatic production of clotting factors. However, the <span class=\"nowrap\">PT/INR</span> is not a good marker for the risk of bleeding in patients with PALF, because PALF reduces both procoagulant proteins and anticoagulant proteins. Therefore, we suggest NOT administering with plasma or other procoagulation products except in patients with active bleeding or in anticipation of an invasive surgical procedure (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H18340182\" class=\"local\">'Coagulopathy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a feared renal complication associated with PALF. Unlike prerenal azotemia, the urine sodium typically is low, and there is no improvement with volume expansion. Renal replacement therapy with hemofiltration or dialysis may be necessary in some cases, but only liver transplantation (LT) can reverse HRS. (See <a href=\"#H18340225\" class=\"local\">'Renal'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metabolic disturbances often seen in patients with PALF include hypoglycemia, hypokalemia hypophosphatemia, and acid-base disturbances. Management requires close monitoring and replacement. Hypoglycemia may require a continuous infusion of hypertonic glucose solution via a central venous catheter. (See <a href=\"#H18340232\" class=\"local\">'Metabolic'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with PALF are susceptible to bacterial infection and sepsis because of immune system dysfunction. Evidence of infection may be subtle, and fever may not be present. Thus, blood cultures should be obtained with any evidence of clinical deterioration, and antibiotics should be initiated if there is a clinical concern for sepsis. (See <a href=\"#H18340239\" class=\"local\">'Infectious'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decisions about whether and when to perform a LT for a patient with PALF are difficult because of uncertainty regarding the patient's outcome without LT and the potential morbidity and mortality of the LT procedure. None of the scoring systems are adequate to direct decisions about LT. (See <a href=\"#H18340283\" class=\"local\">'Disease severity assessment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H18340298\" class=\"local\">'Liver transplant decisions'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Outcomes for patients with PALF vary substantially by diagnosis; acetaminophen-related PALF typically has the highest likelihood of survival without LT (94 percent) as compared with non-acetaminophen drug-induced PALF (41 percent) or indeterminant PALF (45 percent). Other important prognostic factors include age, timing of diagnosis for treatable disorders, and degree of encephalopathy (although a significant minority of patients without encephalopathy die or require LT). </p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-children-management/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Squires RH Jr, Shneider BL, Bucuvalas J, et al.
