For HIV-uninfected patients, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) using antiretroviral medications is an evidence-based way to prevent new infections among those at greatest risk.</p><p>This topic will review how to identify candidates for PrEP. A discussion of antiviral therapy for PrEP, as well as other strategies to prevent HIV infection (eg, antiretroviral therapy for HIV-infected patients, post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV-uninfected patients, and male circumcision) are discussed elsewhere.

Among those who are adherent, PrEP can reduce the risk of HIV transmission by greater than 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-hiv-pre-exposure-prophylaxis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], although rare infections may still occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-hiv-pre-exposure-prophylaxis/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H4284439574\" class=\"local\">'Assessing risk of HIV acquisition'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient should then be evaluated for the presence or absence of conditions that could put them at risk of developing adverse outcomes related to daily therapy with TDF-FTC (eg, acute HIV, reduced kidney function, active hepatitis B virus infection, osteoporosis). Clinicians should also determine if the patient has potential barriers that would prevent them from adhering to a daily medication regimen. (See <a href=\"#H1394697050\" class=\"local\">'Assessing risk of treatment'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The use of PrEP as an HIV prevention strategy has been modestly increasing in the United States since TDF-FTC was approved for PrEP in 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-hiv-pre-exposure-prophylaxis/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. In one analysis more than 79,000 people in the United States started PrEP between early 2012 and the end of 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-hiv-pre-exposure-prophylaxis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Despite this reported increase, the number of individuals initiating PrEP represents a small fraction of the estimated 1.2 million people who have indications for PrEP in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-hiv-pre-exposure-prophylaxis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Uptake has been particularly limited in populations at greatest risk for HIV infection (eg, African Americans) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-hiv-pre-exposure-prophylaxis/abstract/13,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4284439574\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSING RISK OF HIV ACQUISITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important for clinicians to obtain a detailed sexual and drug use history to assess a patient's risk for HIV acquisition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-hiv-pre-exposure-prophylaxis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The risk of HIV acquisition is based upon the type of exposure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F60145\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60145 \">table 2</a>). A more detailed discussion of risk factors for HIV infection is found elsewhere.

We obtain information regarding the patient's sexual behaviors, as well as the HIV status and the risk behaviors of the patient's sex partners. This includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the patient has had condomless penile-anal or penile-vaginal sex with partners other than their main partner</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the patient is in a monogamous relationship, the HIV serostatus of the partner</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If they have sex while using drugs </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If they have had any sexually transmitted infections (STIs)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The number of sexual partners</p><p/><p>It is important that the clinician ask about the patient's sexual behaviors with both main and casual partners. Although some studies have reported a higher number of transmissions from casual partners, one study estimated that 68 percent of HIV transmissions among men who have sex with men (MSM) were from a main partner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-hiv-pre-exposure-prophylaxis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>When discussing the level of risk, it is also important to understand the context of different social and situational factors. Clinicians and patients may make more informed decisions if an individual's patterns of behavior can be clarified. As an example, does the patient have discussions about HIV status with their partners or does the patient have anonymous partners of unknown HIV status?</p><p>Some providers may not feel comfortable talking a detailed sexual history; for such clinicians, several online resources (eg, the <a href=\"http://www.lgbthealtheducation.org/&amp;token=2hNC/5IZDPUD6qfUJhkH1KbGtRF+4PjACF6RPlh3d63rpnfy/Gez5ovkyzHjN+PL&amp;TOPIC_ID=113426\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Fenway National Center for LGBT Health</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/prep/index.html&amp;token=R4Uiw8/bmPVaqNHRDqpXLD5iadF4UN3QIIj0BWCqFSXeEfDjrBkKH9NRVaEOiOqd/SqPqvo7raaXALNLCAHj1Q==&amp;TOPIC_ID=113426\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">CDC website</a>) are available to help guide HIV risk assessment. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1092510904\"><span class=\"h3\">STI screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who are being considered for PrEP should be screened for common bacterial STIs. Although HIV risk behaviors, if elucidated, are likely to be reliable, some patients may not be comfortable disclosing sensitive information to providers. Thus, relying on self-reported risk alone may not be sufficient to make an informed decision about PrEP initiation, and other indicators of risk (eg, syphilis, anogenital gonorrhea, or chlamydia), which have been highly associated with HIV acquisition, must be considered. </p><p>STI screening should include serologic testing for syphilis, and nucleic acid amplification testing for gonorrhea, and chlamydia at relevant mucosal sites (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F103391\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103391 \">table 3</a>). STI testing should be performed even in the absence of symptoms. A more detailed discussion of STI testing is found elsewhere.

HIV-infected patients should be treated with a combination antiretroviral regimen that typically consists of three antiretroviral agents, and the use of TDF-FTC alone would put them at risk for developing drug-resistant virus.

However, we do not use this approach, since the likelihood that patients with acute HIV infection will have a negative fourth generation test and a positive HIV RNA test is low in the absence of symptoms or recent exposures. In addition, HIV RNA testing is more expensive than testing with an <span class=\"nowrap\">antigen/antibody</span> test.</p><p>Although the preferred HIV screening test is a fourth generation <span class=\"nowrap\">antigen/antibody</span> assay, a third generation assay is acceptable if an antigen-antibody test is not available and the clinical history suggests that acute HIV infection is unlikely.

In this study, 410 of the almost 5000 subjects who were screened with rapid third generation tests were HIV infected. In addition, of the 110 participants who seroconverted during the study, 10 had a negative antibody test at baseline but were found to have a positive HIV RNA when testing was done on stored samples from enrollment. Five of these patients had symptoms consistent with acute infection, underscoring the significance of eliciting a full history prior to the initiation of PrEP, and testing for HIV RNA if symptoms are suggestive of acute infection. Most cases of HIV drug resistance occurred in patients with undiagnosed HIV at baseline.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-osteoporosis-in-men#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of osteoporosis in men&quot;, section on 'Candidates for bone density testing'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-premenopausal-osteoporosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of premenopausal osteoporosis&quot;, section on 'Screening'</a>.)</p><p>We then decide whether to initiate PrEP, as well as the need for future monitoring, on a case-by-case basis. Although we do not routinely evaluate bone density for those at low risk for osteoporosis, we discuss the potential risks of bone loss associated with TDF-FTC. </p><p>Clinical trials of PrEP in adults found that HIV-uninfected patients assigned to TDF-FTC had greater declines in z-scores at the hip, lumbar spine, and forearm compared with those taking placebo; however, there were no differences in the rate of fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-hiv-pre-exposure-prophylaxis/abstract/26,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,34</a>]. As an example, in the iPrEx trial, 247 patients who received TDF-FTC and 251 who received placebo were evaluated with DXA scans every six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-hiv-pre-exposure-prophylaxis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. After 24 weeks, modest but significant declines in bone mineral density were seen in those who received TDF-FTC (spine: net difference -0.91 percent [95% CI -1.44 to -0.38 percent]; hip: -0.61 percent [95% CI, -0.96 to -0.27 percent]). There were only smaller further decreases in bone mineral density to week 96. A subsequent study found that bone loss normalized in most patients approximately six months after PrEP was discontinued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-hiv-pre-exposure-prophylaxis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>The bone loss seen with TDF may pose additional risks in adolescent men who have sex with men (MSM) that have not been seen in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-hiv-pre-exposure-prophylaxis/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Importantly, in adolescents, bone loss seems to occur before peak bone mass was attained. In a study that included 135 MSM, 18 to 22 years old, patients who took &ge;4 doses per week of TDF-FTC had modest declines in bone mineral density, whereas those who took &lt;4 doses of TDF-FTC had a 1.54 percent increase in spine bone mineral density [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-hiv-pre-exposure-prophylaxis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p>There are no proven strategies to attenuate bone loss in patients taking PrEP. Vitamin D3 plus calcium supplementation was found to mitigate bone loss in HIV-infected patients taking a TDF-based antiretroviral therapy regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-hiv-pre-exposure-prophylaxis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Although, there are no data on the use of vitamin D to attenuate PrEP-related bone loss, measures to maintain adequate vitamin D levels could theoretically be helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-hiv-pre-exposure-prophylaxis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

Although rates of preterm birth, congenital anomalies, and postnatal growth throughout the first year were also similar, PrEP was discontinued when pregnancy was detected; therefore, the effect of taking TDF with or without emtricitabine during the later stages of pregnancy was not assessed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H643013545\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSING WILLINGNESS TO ADHERE TO PrEP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Potential barriers to adherence (eg, depression, active substance use, stigma) should be identified and addressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-hiv-pre-exposure-prophylaxis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

In these circumstances, clinicians should try to better understand the patient's reasons for wanting to use PrEP and convey the risks and benefits of therapy. Patients who engage in high-risk behaviors may not be comfortable disclosing this information. Thus, we typically provide PrEP if we feel the potential risks and benefits of treatment are fully understood, and there are no underlying behavioral health issues that would impact their decision. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H342205528\"><span class=\"h2\">Adolescents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, TDF-FTC has only been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for PrEP in patients over 18 years of age. However, some clinicians who treat adolescents at high risk for HIV are prescribing PrEP and monitoring them closely. Young MSM are at particularly high risk of acquiring HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-hiv-pre-exposure-prophylaxis/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. Among MSM aged 13 to 24 years, the rate of new infections increased by 43 percent from 2003 to 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-hiv-pre-exposure-prophylaxis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. </p><p>The Adolescent Trials Network studied daily TDF-FTC PrEP in 78 patients 15 to 17 year of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-hiv-pre-exposure-prophylaxis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. TDF-FTC was well tolerated among those who took their medication; however, adherence was suboptimal for many of the youth (protective levels of tenofovir were found in approximately 50 percent at 12 weeks, but only 22 percent at 48 weeks). Thus, potential barriers to adherence should be identified and addressed. (See <a href=\"#H643013545\" class=\"local\">'Assessing willingness to adhere to PrEP'</a> above.) </p><p>In addition to addressing adherence, clinicians must weigh the potential risk of bone effects with the relative risk of acquiring HIV. The bone loss seen with TDF may pose additional risks in adolescent compared with adult men, as described above (see <a href=\"#H374745388\" class=\"local\">'Osteoporosis'</a> above). Although studies are underway to determine if there are ways to reduce these effects (eg, calcium and vitamin D supplementation, less osteotoxic antiretrovirals), at present, TDF-FTC is the only FDA-approved medication for PrEP. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H577629457\"><span class=\"h1\">ADMINISTRATION OF PrEP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who initiate pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate-and-emtricitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-emtricitabine</a> should be taken daily. In addition, patients should receive counseling on other risk reduction methods.
