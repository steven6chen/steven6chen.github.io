Acetaminophen poisoning may occur following a single acute ingestion or through the repeated ingestion of supratherapeutic amounts. The management of the acetaminophen-poisoned patient may include stabilization, decontamination, and administration of N-acetylcysteine, a specific antidote. The duration of N-acetylcysteine treatment is determined by the type of ingestion and the presence or absence of elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentrations.</p><p>The treatment of APAP poisoning is reviewed here. The diagnosis of APAP poisoning, both acute and chronic, and the management of hepatic injury or failure are discussed separately.

Most patients who present early (within 24 hours) after an acute acetaminophen ingestion are asymptomatic, while others may require treatment for symptoms related to coingestants.</p><p>As there are no early symptoms that predict <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> toxicity, poisoning severity following an acute ingestion is quantified by plotting a timed serum acetaminophen concentration on the modified Rumack-Matthew nomogram (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83590\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83590 \">figure 1</a>). Patients with serum acetaminophen concentrations that fall above the treatment line following an acute overdose are treated with N-acetylcysteine. In addition, N-acetylcysteine is given to all patients at significant risk for hepatotoxicity following an ingestion of acetaminophen. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Antidote: acetylcysteine'</a> below.)</p><p>Use of the nomogram, as well as risk factors for hepatotoxicity and the diagnosis of both acute and chronic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> poisoning, are discussed separately.

This is accomplished by initiating treatment within eight hours of an acute ingestion.

Patients who develop anaphylaxis during N-acetylcysteine infusion and are able to continue the infusion should be monitored in a critical care setting for the remainder of the infusion. Patients who tolerate the initial infusion without reaction do not require critical care monitoring for the remaining doses (but may require monitoring for other conditions). </p><p>Limited observational evidence is available regarding the continuation of IV N-acetylcysteine in patients with anaphylaxis, and we encourage consultation with a regional poison control center or medical toxicologist to determine whether the infusion should continue after an allergic reaction has occurred.

IV N-acetylcysteine should <strong>not</strong> be restarted. Oral N-acetylcysteine therapy should be provided as an alternative. These patients will generally tolerate oral N-acetylcysteine.

The palatability of N-acetylcysteine can be improved by diluting it to a 5 percent solution in cola or juice, covering the cup, and drinking through a straw.</p><p>It is reasonable to administer an antiemetic to nauseated patients or patients who have vomited prior to receiving oral N-acetylcysteine. Serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ondansetron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ondansetron</a>) are effective antiemetics that are widely used in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acetaminophen-paracetamol-poisoning-in-adults-treatment/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Although treatment with ondansetron was associated with higher peak ALT values in one trial, the clinical relevance of these findings remains unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acetaminophen-paracetamol-poisoning-in-adults-treatment/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>If a patient vomits within 60 minutes of an oral dose of N-acetylcysteine, the dose should be repeated.

Our approach is based upon a small number of case reports in which patients had toxic acetaminophen concentrations at the end of the 20 hour IV treatment protocol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acetaminophen-paracetamol-poisoning-in-adults-treatment/abstract/20,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,38,39</a>].</p><p>Other guidelines recommend measuring serum <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, INR, serum bicarbonate, and serum creatinine at the end of treatment and continuing treatment if any value is abnormal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acetaminophen-paracetamol-poisoning-in-adults-treatment/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The ALT is used to monitor the degree of hepatic injury and the other tests are used to determine the need for liver transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acetaminophen-paracetamol-poisoning-in-adults-treatment/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

However, in some cases, there is no practical way to ascertain the time of ingestion, making it impossible to use the acetaminophen poisoning nomogram for risk stratification. We recommend the following approach to these patients: </p><p>If the history suggests a single ingestion and it is possible to narrow the ingestion time to a specific window (eg, patient had been continually observed until 12 hours prior to admission so the ingestion could not have occurred more than 12 hours ago), it may be possible to construct a worst-case scenario and plot the measured serum concentration using the &ldquo;last known time prior to ingestion&rdquo; as the &ldquo;time of ingestion.&rdquo; N-acetylcysteine would be given based upon this scenario.</p><p>If it is not possible to estimate a time of ingestion (due to lack of information or multiple ingestions), there is no universally accepted approach to risk stratification. Given the unknown risks, we take a conservative approach. We suggest starting treatment with N-acetylcysteine for any patient with a detectable serum <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> concentration. In addition, we suggest treating any patient with elevated serum transaminase concentrations and a history consistent with acetaminophen exposure regardless of the serum acetaminophen concentration.

Extracorporeal removal may be useful for lowering serum acetaminophen concentrations if N-acetylcysteine is not available, but there are no systematic studies to evaluate the effectiveness of this treatment. Hemodialysis should never be considered an alternative to N-acetylcysteine therapy.</p><p>In the rare instance when severe <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> poisoning is complicated by acute kidney injury (acute renal failure), hemodialysis is necessary. Otherwise, in the authors&rsquo; experience, hemodialysis is rarely needed even for severe poisoning and should be obtained only when standard indications independent of the poisoning are present. For patients with a massive overdose and evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction (such as severe lactic acidosis without liver failure), some experts advocate early hemodialysis in addition to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetylcysteine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetylcysteine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acetaminophen-paracetamol-poisoning-in-adults-treatment/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. However, this recommendation is based on expert opinion and there are many reported cases of recovery with acetylcysteine therapy alone. While hemodialysis is a reasonable treatment, it should not be considered a standard therapy for these cases.</p><p>Of note, hemodialysis removes N-acetylcysteine as well as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, so some toxicologists recommend doubling the standard dose during hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acetaminophen-paracetamol-poisoning-in-adults-treatment/abstract/75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,76</a>]. However, it is not clear that the amount of N-acetylcysteine removed affects clinical outcomes, so increasing the rate is not universally recommended and should not be considered a standard of care.

No deaths have been reported in any of the large studies of acetaminophen overdose provided NAC was given within 10 hours of ingestion, regardless of the initial serum acetaminophen concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acetaminophen-paracetamol-poisoning-in-adults-treatment/abstract/10,11,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,77</a>]. As an example, one study of 333 consecutive acetaminophen overdose cases found that hepatotoxicity occurred in only 4 percent of patients and mortality was less than 1 percent when NAC was rapidly administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acetaminophen-paracetamol-poisoning-in-adults-treatment/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Thus, when fulminant hepatic failure and death occur from acetaminophen poisoning, they result from a delay in seeking medical attention, recognition of poisoning, or the institution of appropriate therapy.</p><p>Studies are underway to discover combinations of biomarkers that can identify early in their presentation those patients at greatest risk for acute liver injury following <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> overdose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acetaminophen-paracetamol-poisoning-in-adults-treatment/abstract/79-82\" class=\"abstract_t\">79-82</a>].

Patients who present within 24 hours after an acute ingestion are generally asymptomatic. Patients who present later may manifest symptoms and signs of hepatic injury. There are no early symptoms that predict acetaminophen toxicity; poisoning severity in acute ingestion is quantified by plotting a timed serum acetaminophen concentration on the modified Rumack-Matthew nomogram (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83590\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83590 \">figure 1</a>). A summary table to facilitate emergent management is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51346\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51346 \">table 1</a>).

The key to effective treatment is to start therapy before the onset of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation. This is accomplished by initiating treatment within eight hours of an acute ingestion. Suggestions for treatment with N-acetylcysteine in difficult clinical circumstances (eg, time of ingestion unknown, patient is pregnant) are provided in the text (see <a href=\"#H71550036\" class=\"local\">'Antidote treatment in special circumstances'</a> above).
