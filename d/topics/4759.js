In 1985, the median predicted survival was 25 years of age, while in 2016 it had increased to 42 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-investigational-therapies/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In an effort to further prolong the life span of patients with CF, many potential new treatments are being actively investigated. This topic review will summarize some of the promising experimental therapies that have advanced to clinical trials. They include approaches to replace the abnormal Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, reverse the consequences of the genetic defect on protein function, promote clearance of respiratory secretions, reduce or eliminate bacterial infection, and reduce the deleterious pulmonary inflammatory response. Those trials that are listed in the <a href=\"http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/&amp;token=NK91I08KOJ1eJ1hT1o/oHgJu4vbbEBRl2V0d48fIIMDpbZTpeZvuNaOE2M5VxYDS&amp;TOPIC_ID=13510\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NIH Clinical Trials Registry</a> will be designated by including their NCT identifier codes, and further details about each trial are available through links to that database. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3393757\"><span class=\"h1\">GENE THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The drive for developing gene therapy to treat CF began in earnest in 1989 with the identification and cloning of the Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Because mutations in CFTR account for virtually all cases of CF, correcting abnormalities in this single gene should theoretically cure the disease (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Genetics and pathogenesis&quot;</a>). Despite early progress in the gene therapy field, many significant obstacles impede the development of this approach as a treatment for CF including vector efficiency, transgene persistence, and evasion of host immune responses. To overcome these barriers, research in this field is focusing on developing more efficient and safe vectors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-investigational-therapies/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. </p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.cfgenetherapy.org.uk/&amp;token=bmTq7ZuIcyocF4e9UyYv8sY2WTAgWN/7g41RAa+FQXiQ0wcnWHKxxVnZJJzPQP2d&amp;TOPIC_ID=13510\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">UK Cystic Fibrosis Gene Therapy Consortium</a> has tested a cationic lipid formulation (GL67A) to transfer a cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG)-free plasmid encoding functional human CFTR cDNA to the airway epithelium (where CpG-free refers to plasmids lacking a specific DNA sequence known to induce inflammation in experimental animals) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-investigational-therapies/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Twelve monthly administrations of the <span class=\"nowrap\">lipid/plasmid</span> formulation resulted in prolonged CFTR gene expression (&gt;140 days) in the lungs of mice, with minimal toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-investigational-therapies/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The results of a randomized, double-blind, phase 2b clinical trial in CF subjects have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-investigational-therapies/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Participants with CF received a CFTR-containing plasmid in GL67A or placebo every 4 weeks for 48 weeks, and the primary endpoint was the relative change in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>). A subgroup also received intranasal administrations so that nasal transepithelial potential difference could be tested to directly assess for successful expression of the CFTR channel. Subjects who received the CFTR-GL67A formulation demonstrated a modest 3.7 percent increase in percent predicted FEV<sub>1</sub> at week 48 compared with the placebo group (95% CI 0.1%&ndash;7.3%; p = 0.046). The CFTR-GL67A-treated patients also had improvement in several secondary endpoints including forced vital capacity (FVC) and a CT measurement of gas trapping (p = 0.048). However, other secondary endpoints including quality of life were not different between the two groups. A subset of patients underwent bronchoscopy to evaluate CFTR gene expression. Vector-specific DNA was detected in 12 of 14 CFTR-GL67A-treated patients and was below the limit of measurement in all (n = 7) placebo samples (p = 0.00); however, there was no vector-specific mRNA detected in bronchial samples from either group. Nasal potential difference measurements did not change significantly during the study. In summary, these results indicate that substantial improvements to this approach will need to be made for it to move forward in the treatment of CF lung disease. </p><p>Preclinical work is progressing on the development of lentivirus-based [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-investigational-therapies/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] and adeno-associated virus-based [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-investigational-therapies/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] vectors for CFTR gene transfer to airway epithelium. Advancements in gene editing technology hold promise, but applications of techniques such as <span class=\"nowrap\">CRISPR/Cas</span> to CF are in only very early stages of development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-investigational-therapies/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3393763\"><span class=\"h1\">REVERSING THE CONSEQUENCES OF CFTR MUTATIONS ON PROTEIN FUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivacaftor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ivacaftor</a>, a small molecular weight compound developed to treat CFTR class III (gating) mutations, was the first mutation-specific drug to receive Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for use in CF. This drug was initially approved for treatment of patients with the G551D gating defect and was then expanded to eight other gating mutations (G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N, or S549R). As of May 2017, the list was further expanded, so that ivacaftor is approved by the FDA for the treatment of 33 CFTR mutations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113340\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113340 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-investigational-therapies/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] &#160; Although the approval of ivacaftor represented a remarkable advance, these gating and residual function mutations are present in only approximately 10 percent of CF patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease#H1066239125\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Overview of the treatment of lung disease&quot;, section on 'Ivacaftor for gating and residual function mutations'</a>.) </p><p>Using the same drug discovery strategy, lumacaftor was developed to improve the intracellular trafficking of F508del-CFTR, the most common CF-causing mutation that is present in 86 percent of individuals in the CF Foundation Patient Registry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-investigational-therapies/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The combination of lumacaftor with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivacaftor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ivacaftor</a> was found clinically beneficial for patients homozygous for F508del, leading to FDA approval. (See <a href=\"#H2308200431\" class=\"local\">'Lumacaftor-ivacaftor'</a> below.) </p><p>The success of using small molecules to correct the basic defect in CF has motivated the development of additional drugs that target other mutations. In general, the strategy to correct the different mutations is dictated by how the different classes of mutations affect CFTR protein synthesis, structure, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> function, as outlined below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Genetics and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Genetic changes in CFTR'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3393769\"><span class=\"h2\">Class I mutations: Defective protein production</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonsense mutations in CFTR introduce premature stop codons so that the messenger ribonucleic acid (RNA) is truncated and no mature CFTR protein is produced. This type of mutation accounts for 2 to 5 percent of cases of CF worldwide, but is much more frequent in some populations (eg, Ashkenazi Jews). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Genetics and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Class I mutations: Defective protein production'</a>.) </p><p>One approach to correcting Class I mutations is to repair the abnormal mRNA generated by the mutant gene.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>QR-010</strong> &ndash; QR-010 (ProQR therapeutics) is an oligonucleotide based therapy that targets F508del mRNA and has entered clinical trials (<a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02532764&amp;token=nbsXe3i4qfUea5RCPRHtOS7yhoEzH+MCpwZ1/1ekxPPgQeQXof8Gw5iX3oaYQGkxztCnMZZTR1EL1y3Orab2Yg==&amp;TOPIC_ID=13510\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NCT02532764</a>). </p><p/><p>Another treatment strategy for patients with this type of mutation includes drugs that allow the ribosome to read through premature stop codons during translation, while still honoring true stop codons. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ataluren</strong> &ndash; Ataluren (formerly known as PTC124) is an orally available drug that allows the ribosome to read through premature stop codons during translation. This agent has been tested in both adults and children with CF. After some initially promising results, subsequent phase 3 trials failed to show clinical benefit (<a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02139306&amp;token=nbsXe3i4qfUea5RCPRHtOS7yhoEzH+MCpwZ1/1ekxPNCECsJO3BipkrfVsYLkB1XNHHUUMkKll4HqpF64pxIUw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=13510\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NCT02139306</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-investigational-therapies/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Based on these negative results, a decision was made by the pharmaceutical company to discontinue further clinical trials of this drug for CF patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-investigational-therapies/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H57140018\"><span class=\"h2\">Class II mutations: Defective protein processing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mutations in this class cause defective protein processing and are the most common cause of CF worldwide. These include the F508del mutation, which causes improper folding of the CFTR protein during its synthesis. F508del is by far the most prevalent CFTR mutation with 46.1 percent of patients with CF being homozygous and another 40.3 percent being heterozygous for this mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-investigational-therapies/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Genetics and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Class II mutations: Defective protein processing'</a>). The incorrectly folded F508del protein is recognized by the cell as defective and the majority of it is degraded in the proteasome. As a result, very little mature F508del CFTR protein is trafficked to its targeted location on the apical surface of cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-investigational-therapies/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Importantly, the F508del CFTR that does make it to the cell surface also exhibits defective gating (Class III mutation). Hence, treatments to correct folding of F508del are typically paired with a potentiator drug to enhance F508del function on the cell surface. (See <a href=\"#H3393781\" class=\"local\">'Class III mutations: Defective regulation'</a> below.)</p><p>Because of the high frequency of F508del mutations in CF, a concerted effort has been put forth to identify drugs that can assist with F508del folding and permit its transfer to the apical surface of expressing cells. High-throughput screening of large combinatorial chemical libraries identified candidate molecules (called &quot;correctors&quot;) that allow F508del CFTR to be transported to the apical surface. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2308200431\"><span class=\"h3\">Lumacaftor-ivacaftor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lumacaftor (VX-809) is one such drug that when combined with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivacaftor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ivacaftor</a> was proven efficacious for patients homozygous for F508del mutations. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lumacaftor-and-ivacaftor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lumacaftor-ivacaftor</a> has now received FDA approval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-investigational-therapies/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, the observed improvement in forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) from lumacaftor-ivacaftor was modest, and the combination was not efficacious in patients heterozygous for F508del. Furthermore, the treatment has a relatively high frequency of adverse respiratory side effects causing a significant number of patients to stop the drug within several month of starting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-investigational-therapies/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Moreover, lumacaftor is a strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inducer that results in substantial <span class=\"nowrap\">drug/drug</span> interactions (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease#H1066239299\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Overview of the treatment of lung disease&quot;, section on 'Lumacaftor-ivacaftor for F508del'</a>).

Strategic targets include the following: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gene therapy</strong> &ndash; Small improvements in lung function have been achieved with cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene transfer using a cationic lipid-based vector. However, multiple barriers including vector efficiency, durability of transgene expression, and host immune responses must be overcome to achieve a more robust benefit. Preclinical work is now investigating viral vectors for CFTR gene transfer and CRISPR-Cas for gene editing. (See <a href=\"#H3393757\" class=\"local\">'Gene therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Correction of dysfunctional CFTR protein</strong> &ndash; These therapies are classified based on their effect on CFTR processing and include: 1) CFTR correctors that promote F508del protein folding, 2) CFTR potentiators which amplify gating function and increase the activity of normal CFTR, and 3) CFTR amplifiers which increase the amount of protein at the cell surface. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Several therapies in this class, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivacaftor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ivacaftor</a> (a potentiator) and ivacaftor with lumacaftor (a corrector), are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for CF patients with select mutations. (See <a href=\"#H2308200431\" class=\"local\">'Lumacaftor-ivacaftor'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Several novel correctors are in development for patients with misfolded CFTR caused by the F508del mutation. Tezacaftor has advanced furthest in clinical trials, and several phase 3 studies of combined tezacaftor and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivacaftor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ivacaftor</a> have recently concluded. Investigators observed benefits of this combination therapy in subjects with a F508del homozygous genotype and with a F508del mutation and a second CFTR mutation with residual function. (See <a href=\"#H3996275511\" class=\"local\">'Tezacaftor-ivacaftor'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>To improve protein processing of the F508del mutation, novel agents that work in concert with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lumacaftor-and-ivacaftor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lumacaftor-ivacaftor</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tezacaftor-and-ivacaftor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tezacaftor-ivacaftor</a> are being developed. These small molecules are designated &quot;next generation&quot; correctors, and VX-440 and VX-152 have entered Phase II clinical trials. In vitro studies suggest that the combination of tezacaftor-ivacaftor with a next generation corrector is potent. If this translates into clinical benefit, this treatment approach has the potential to significantly impact the health of patients carrying a F508del mutation. (See <a href=\"#H2364085747\" class=\"local\">'Additional compounds with f508del corrector properties'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Strategies to treat the downstream effects of CFTR dysfunction include</strong>: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Agents that improve airway hydration &ndash; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Mannitol</a> is an osmotic agent that is now being evaluated in a 3<sup>rd</sup> phase III trial following mixed efficacy and safety outcomes in preceding studies.
