(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-classification-etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-shock-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, classification, etiology, and pathophysiology of shock in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Multiple shock categories are often present during surgery. For example, a trauma patient with hemorrhage (hypovolemic shock) may also have a tension pneumothorax (obstructive shock) or spinal cord injury (neurogenic shock). Another example is severe ischemic myocardial dysfunction (cardiogenic shock) caused by hypotension due to sepsis (distributive shock). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-and-initial-approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-undifferentiated-hypotension-and-shock#H793384199\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of and initial approach to the adult patient with undifferentiated hypotension and shock&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Simultaneous evaluation and resuscitation may be necessary before and during emergency surgery in a shock patient (see <a href=\"#H3150619658\" class=\"local\">'Initial resuscitation'</a> below). In some cases, life-saving treatment must be initiated without a complete history, laboratory results, or diagnostic images (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F99357\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef99357 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F100420\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef100420 \">algorithm 2</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4125008393\"><span class=\"h2\">General assessment</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vital signs</strong> &ndash; Clinical features of shock typically include tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension. Hypotension may be absolute (systolic blood pressure [BP] &lt;90 mmHg, mean arterial pressure &lt;65 mmHg) or relative (eg, a decrease that is &ge;40 mmHg below the patient's baseline).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Hypotension may not be evident in the earliest stages of shock because of cardiovascular homeostatic mechanisms. Since systemic BP is dependent upon both cardiac output (CO) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR), BP may be temporarily maintained by vasoconstriction in a patient with reduced CO, or by increasing the CO in a patient with reduced SVR.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Pulse pressure (PP) is the difference between systolic and diastolic BP (P<sub>systolic</sub> - P<sub>diastolic</sub>), as measured by invasive or noninvasive methods. The PP represents the dynamic between CO and SVR (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F109760\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef109760 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F85848\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef85848 \">figure 2</a>). Assessment of PP may be helpful for categorizing shock into a high or low CO state, but should be considered in the context of the diastolic BP (rather than as an absolute value):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Reduced PP</strong> &ndash; Reduced PP may be due to a low cardiac output with vasoconstriction, which occurs in most types of shock. For example, a vasoconstricted shock patient with BP <span class=\"nowrap\">90/60</span> mmHg has a small PP of only 30 mmHg, which is less than the diastolic BP.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Increased PP</strong> &ndash; Increased PP may be due to a high cardiac output with vasodilation, which occurs in distributive shock. For example, a vasodilated patient with BP <span class=\"nowrap\">90/35</span> has a large PP of 55 mmHg, which is higher than the diastolic BP. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Available preoperative tests</strong> &ndash; The electrocardiogram and results of laboratory tests are examined. These may include arterial blood gases, serum lactate, renal and liver function tests, cardiac biomarkers, and complete blood count, as well as imaging studies (eg, portable chest radiograph, computed tomography [CT] of the head, spine, chest, abdomen, pelvis, or pulmonary artery). </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1612473459\"><span class=\"h2\">Point-of-care ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Point-of-care ultrasonography may be useful to diagnose or confirm the cause(s) of shock in the preoperative area or after arrival in the operating room (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F100420\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef100420 \">algorithm 2</a>).
