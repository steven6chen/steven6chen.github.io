High-risk patients require admission to hospital for intravenous antibiotics and often require a prolonged length of stay. By contrast, low-risk patients may be treated with oral antibiotics as outpatients after a brief period of observation or a short hospital admission.

Patients with neutropenic fever who have ongoing comorbidities or evidence of significant hepatic or renal dysfunction are also considered to be high risk, regardless of the duration of neutropenia. Other criteria that confer a high-risk status can be found in the Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F67027\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67027 \">table 1</a>).
