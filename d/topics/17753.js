IMRT was associated with improved overall survival (five-year overall survival 79.6 versus 67.1 percent) and decreased toxicity. Similarly, a single institution analysis of 1593 patients treated over a 16-year period demonstrated a progressive improvement in overall survival with more conformal techniques (five-year rates 85 versus 81 versus 78 percent for IMRT, three-dimensional conformal, and two-dimensional conformal RT techniques) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-and-locoregionally-advanced-nasopharyngeal-carcinoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two randomized studies in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma have shown that IMRT is superior to conventional RT in preserving parotid function and resulted in less severe late xerostomia without affecting local control in patients with early stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-and-locoregionally-advanced-nasopharyngeal-carcinoma/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. </p><p/><p>Since the dose gradient for IMRT is quite steep, it is important to ensure adequate patient immobilization and verify daily treatment set-up accuracy. Image-guided RT (IGRT) is often used with IMRT for verification of set-up accuracy and for consideration of adaptive replanning in cases where there is a significant change in the patient's anatomy due to rapid tumor shrinkage or weight loss. Although some institutions have performed dosimetric comparisons between IMRT and intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) for nasopharyngeal carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-and-locoregionally-advanced-nasopharyngeal-carcinoma/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>], clinical data on the use of IMPT in nasopharyngeal carcinoma are lacking.

A similar dosing schedule is used for more advanced disease, with 66 to 70 Gy to involved lymph nodes. In patients with N0 neck, it may be safe to cover the upper neck down to level III and to omit level IV and supraclavicular nodes. However, this approach is controversial since prophylactic treatment of level IV lymph nodes is minimally morbid with proper IMRT technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-and-locoregionally-advanced-nasopharyngeal-carcinoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1795247112\"><span class=\"h3\">Alternative RT schedules</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conventional fractionation using five daily fractions of RT per week remains the standard of care in nasopharyngeal carcinoma when delivered with chemotherapy. Although accelerated fractionation has been tested as an alternative, randomized trials suggest that it is not superior to a conventionally fractionated schedule of five treatments per week.

Four hundred and eighty six patients were randomized to the conventional fractionation group and 316 patients to the accelerated group. Because of accrual issues, the protocol was amended to allow the centers that had logistical difficulty with arranging six RT fractions per week to opt out of the accelerated fractionation portion of the trial. </p><p>Preliminary results from this trial showed that accelerated fractionation did not confer any outcome benefit but was associated with increased toxicity, specifically acute mucositis and dehydration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-and-locoregionally-advanced-nasopharyngeal-carcinoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In addition, at least two other trials with altered fractionation schedules have either increased toxicity or not improved survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-and-locoregionally-advanced-nasopharyngeal-carcinoma/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of the neck</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nasopharyngeal cancer has a propensity for early, bilateral spread to regional lymph nodes in the neck.

In a randomized trial, 301 patients with node negative disease were randomly assigned to treatment to either the upper neck only (down to and including level III) or to whole neck irradiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-and-locoregionally-advanced-nasopharyngeal-carcinoma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. At a median follow-up of 39 months, there were no patients in either group who had a cervical lymph node relapse. </p><p>For patients with lymph node involvement, RT should encompass the whole neck.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3610826314\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery is not used as first-line treatment at the primary site because of the deep anatomical location of the nasopharynx and its close proximity to critical neurovascular structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-and-locoregionally-advanced-nasopharyngeal-carcinoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, neck dissection may be indicated after RT for residual nodal disease or for an isolated neck recurrence; nasopharyngectomy may be an option for a small localized recurrence and is used more commonly in Asia.

For more advanced disease, concurrent chemoradiation reduces the rate of distant metastasis, and improves local control and overall survival compared with RT alone. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'General treatment principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment approaches are based upon the stage of the disease. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that treatment should differ based upon World Health Organization (WHO) histopathologic classification despite differences in prognosis. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Endemic versus nonendemic disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with early (stage I (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110658\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110658 \">table 1</a>)) disease, we recommend RT alone rather than a combined modality approach (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Early (stage I) disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with intermediate (stage II) disease, we suggest concurrent chemoradiation rather than RT alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Intermediate (stage II) disease'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with advanced (stage III, IVA, and IVB) disease, we recommend concurrent chemoradiotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). While adjuvant chemotherapy has been a standard part of many concurrent chemoradiotherapy regimens, its benefit is uncertain, and toxicity is substantial.

Low-dose weekly cisplatin (30 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> weekly) concurrent with RT is an alternative option.

However, some experts do choose sequential therapy for large or extensive primary tumors, or advanced nodal disease. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Sequential chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given the propensity of nasopharyngeal carcinoma for early and bilateral spread to regional lymph nodes, we recommend bilateral neck irradiation for all patients, including those with a clinically negative neck (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). For those with a clinically and radiographically negative neck, the role of RT to the low neck level IV and supraclavicular nodes is controversial. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Management of the neck'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We obtain a posttreatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the skull base and neck, and a full body combined positron emission tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET)/computed</span> tomography (CT) scan at approximately three months after treatment completion to evaluate treatment response and to serve as a baseline. (See <a href=\"#H321632033\" class=\"local\">'Posttreatment follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nasopharyngeal carcinoma has a propensity to recur much later than other head and neck cancer sites, both locally and distantly.
