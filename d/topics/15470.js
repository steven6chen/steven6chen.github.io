Testicular cancer occurs more frequently among white men than among men of other races.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Possible risk factors</strong> &ndash; Other factors not conclusively shown to increase the risk for testicular cancer include environmental exposures, infertility, and testicular microlithiasis (microcalcification).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Not a risk factor</strong> &ndash; Vasectomy has <strong>not</strong> been shown to be a risk factor for developing testicular cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2303366\"><span class=\"h1\">RATIONALE FOR NOT SCREENING ROUTINELY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest NOT screening asymptomatic male adolescents or adults who do not have known risk factors for testicular cancer on the basis of uncertain benefits of screening and some likelihood of harms.</p><p>Systematic reviews found no randomized trials comparing screening with not screening for testicular cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-testicular-cancer/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2615394845\"><span class=\"h2\">Limited benefits</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, for screening to be beneficial, detection of an asymptomatic cancer at a preclinical stage needs to increase the potential for cure, minimize harms including treatment-related morbidity, and be reasonably cost-effective. The low incidence and high cure rate of testicular cancer make it unlikely that screening for testicular cancer would appreciably decrease the cancer mortality rate.</p><p>As detailed elsewhere, testicular cancer occurs relatively infrequently (see <a href=\"#H18074155\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above). A primary care clinician doing routine examinations could expect to diagnose one patient with testicular cancer every 20 to 25 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-testicular-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Another factor in the decision whether to screen is the comparative morbidity and mortality between treatments initiated at early and later stages of disease. For testicular cancer, the cure rate is high even when diagnosed at an advanced stage of disease and two-thirds of tumors are Stage I at diagnosis, so the potential that screening would spare treatment-related morbidity or mortality associated with more advanced disease is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-testicular-cancer/abstract/2,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,14</a>].</p><p>Furthermore, to screen effectively, there must be useful methods, and for testicular cancer, there are no screening tests proven to be useful, as discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H944569883\"><span class=\"h2\">Limitations and potential harms of testicular examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Periodic palpation of the testes by the patient (self-examination) or clinician could lead to detection of testicular cancers before they cause noticeable symptoms. However, there are no studies of the sensitivity or specificity of clinician or self-examination for testicular cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-testicular-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], so the utility of testicular examination for screening is unknown.</p><p>Harms of screening for testicular cancer with clinician or self-examination are likely minimal but could include false-positive results, anxiety, over-diagnosis, and adverse effects of subsequent diagnostic tests or procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-testicular-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Opportunity costs (time and effort required<em> </em>by patients and the health system) of screening are also a consideration. Systematic reviews have found no studies evaluating harms of screening with testicular examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-testicular-cancer/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H167459261\"><span class=\"h2\">No role for screening with biomarkers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no blood tests considered to be useful for screening asymptomatic men for testicular cancer.
