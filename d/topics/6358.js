Symptoms that warrant further evaluation for ovarian cancer are those that are of new onset, coexist with other symptoms, occur almost daily, and are more severe than expected. The Gynecologic Cancer Foundation, American Cancer Society, and Society of Gynecologic Oncologists issued a consensus statement regarding early symptoms in 2007 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76135\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76135 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>There are anecdotal reports that women with tubal carcinoma present with more intense pain than those with an ovarian carcinoma, possibly due to tubal distension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The role of pelvic or abdominal symptoms in the detection of ovarian cancer is discussed in detail separately.

If malignancy is recognized intraoperatively, intraoperative consultation from a gynecologic oncologist should be requested, if available. If a gynecologic oncologist is not available and a surgeon is not experienced in operative management of ovarian cancer (eg, lymphadenectomy), it is prudent to terminate the surgery and arrange for prompt consultation with a specialist for a second procedure. (See <a href=\"#H13734725\" class=\"local\">'Referral to a specialist'</a> below.)</p><p>If ovarian cancer is discovered only upon histologic evaluation following surgery, the patient should be referred to a gynecologic oncologist. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13733315\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO EVALUATION OF WOMEN WITH SUSPECTED OVARIAN CANCER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of epithelial ovarian (EOC), fallopian tubal, or peritoneal carcinoma requires surgical exploration. The primary reason for this is that women with early stage disease (ie, no malignant cells in ascites or peritoneal cytology) benefit from removal of the adnexal mass intact, since incising or rupturing the mass results in a more advanced stage of disease and adversely affects prognosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113545\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113545 \">table 2</a>). Thus, image-guided ovarian biopsy is generally not performed and unfortunately, many women undergo surgical procedures to identify the few who have a malignancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oophorectomy-and-ovarian-cystectomy#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oophorectomy and ovarian cystectomy&quot;, section on 'Spillage of malignant cells'</a>.) </p><p>There are some exceptions to diagnosis via a surgical procedure. These include women who are poor candidate for aggressive initial surgical cytoreduction due to imaging findings of extensive disease (liver or pulmonary metastases, disease in the porta hepatis, or massive ascites) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> with a poor performance status. These women may be best treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. These women are typically evaluated with imaging and either paracentesis, thoracentesis, or image-guided biopsy rather than surgery prior to treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=first-line-chemotherapy-for-advanced-stage-iii-or-iv-epithelial-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-cancer#H250841373\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;First-line chemotherapy for advanced (stage III or IV) epithelial ovarian, fallopian tubal, and peritoneal cancer&quot;, section on 'Neoadjuvant chemotherapy'</a> and <a href=\"#H13733571\" class=\"local\">'Assessing for metastatic disease'</a> below.)</p><p>The most important element of the evaluation is the finding of an adnexal mass on imaging. The usual indication for a surgical evaluation for ovarian or fallopian tubal carcinoma the finding of an adnexal mass that is suspicious for malignancy. In general, other features (eg, symptoms, risk factors, laboratory results) may contribute to the clinical suspicion of malignancy, but are usually not a sufficient indication for surgery. One exception to this is that some experts perform diagnostic laparoscopy for women who have both EOC-associated symptoms and an elevated tumor marker. </p><p>Women with peritoneal carcinoma may present either with or without an adnexal mass. For these women, the decision to proceed with surgery is based upon either the combination of EOC-associated symptoms and an elevated tumor marker or upon imaging findings consistent with peritoneal carcinomatosis. (See <a href=\"#H6099199\" class=\"local\">'Pelvic and abdominal symptoms'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-an-adnexal-mass#H543206\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with an adnexal mass&quot;, section on 'Laboratory studies'</a>.)</p><p>The evaluation of women with features suggestive of EOC is typically a two-phase process:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An initial evaluation of women to determine whether an adnexal mass or elevated tumor markers are present and whether there is sufficient clinical suspicion of malignancy to proceed with surgery (see <a href=\"#H6099223\" class=\"local\">'Initial evaluation'</a> below). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If there is no indication for diagnostic surgery (adnexal mass, EOC-associated symptoms and an elevated tumor marker, or peritoneal carcinomatosis), the clinician should pursue an evaluation for other etiologies of the patient&rsquo;s symptoms or signs. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If an adnexal mass is found and based upon the initial evaluation, there is a suspicion of EOC, surgical evaluation is performed.

The goals of the preoperative evaluation are to exclude metastatic disease, a synchronous primary cancer, and the possibility that the adnexal mass is due to metastases from an extraovarian (or extratubal) primary cancer. This evaluation may also result in the decision to treat with neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to surgery.

Traditionally, clinicians attempted to distinguish between these malignancies and assigned an apparent primary site (ie, ovary, tube, or peritoneum) and designating the primary site is advised as part of staging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H13733315\" class=\"local\">'Approach to evaluation of women with suspected ovarian cancer'</a> above.)</p><p>There should be a high index of suspicion for peritoneal carcinoma if peritoneal carcinomatosis is found on imaging.

Women with postmenopausal bleeding should be assessed for uterine pathology before proceeding with an evaluation for ovarian cancer. For women with both abnormal uterine bleeding and an adnexal mass, an evaluation of both the endometrium and of the adnexal mass should be pursued.
