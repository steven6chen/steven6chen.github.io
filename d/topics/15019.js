A general approach to counseling women with leiomyomas about reproductive issues will be reviewed here. Effects of fibroids during pregnancy and other fibroid-related issues are discussed in detail separately (see individual topic reviews). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy in women with uterine leiomyomas (fibroids)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ASYMPTOMATIC LEIOMYOMAS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A uterine leiomyoma in an asymptomatic woman is usually an incidental finding. Although some of these tumors will naturally regress, others will continue to grow and new leiomyomas may develop. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-epidemiology-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-natural-history#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine leiomyomas (fibroids): Epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and natural history&quot;, section on 'Natural history'</a>.)</p><p>Use of low dose estrogen-progestin contraceptives does not cause leiomyomas to grow; therefore, administration of these drugs is not contraindicated in women with leiomyomas who wish to use this method of contraception. One possible exception is girls with exposure to estrogen-progestive contraceptives between the ages of 13 and 16 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reproductive-issues-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In adolescents, the advantages of estrogen-progestin contraceptives need to be weighed against this potential risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-epidemiology-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-natural-history#H5291214\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine leiomyomas (fibroids): Epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and natural history&quot;, section on 'Hormonal contraception'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PRECONCEPTIONAL PLANNING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest that women with leiomyomas not postpone pregnancy for a prolonged period of time, if possible. Our rationale is that fertility naturally declines with age, especially after age 35 years, and leiomyomas may impair fertility and adversely affect pregnancy outcome (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Infertility and miscarriage'</a> below).</p><p>There are no well-designed studies that provide high-quality data on whether leiomyomas adversely affect pregnancy outcome. Instead, the available information consists largely of observational case series and case reports that are limited by different patient populations; different criteria regarding the size, location, and number of leiomyomas; small numbers of adverse events; ascertainment bias in selecting study participants; and inadequate adjustment of confounders.</p><p>However, in a large retrospective cohort of 2058 women who were found to have uterine leiomyoma at the second trimester of pregnancy, the risks of preterm birth less than 37 weeks (15.1 percent versus 10.5 percent, odds ratio [OR] 1.5, 95% CI 1.3-1.8), and intrauterine fetal death in women with a fetus with growth restriction (3.9 percent versus 1.5 percent, OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.2-5.0) were higher compared with those without leiomyoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reproductive-issues-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>In the absence of high-quality data, we suggest not performing prophylactic myomectomy to prevent pregnancy complications. Myomectomy can be considered in selected patients with a history of obstetrical complications that appear related to the presence of leiomyomas (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy in women with uterine leiomyomas (fibroids)&quot;</a>). In general, we perform myomectomy before pregnancy if it is symptomatic. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">INFERTILITY AND MISCARRIAGE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Leiomyomas are estimated to account for 1 to 2 percent of infertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reproductive-issues-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Fibroids, particularly those that impinge upon the endometrium, may affect fertility by interfering with implantation over the myoma site, rapidly distending the uterus in early pregnancy, or impairing uterine contractility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reproductive-issues-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p>The location of a fibroid, and not its size, is the key factor regarding fertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reproductive-issues-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Leiomyomas that distort the uterine cavity (submucosal or intramural with an intracavitary component) result in difficulty conceiving a pregnancy and an increased risk of miscarriage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reproductive-issues-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. In contrast, subserosal fibroids do not impact fertility. The role of intramural fibroids in infertility is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reproductive-issues-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>This was illustrated in a meta-analysis of 23 studies that compared infertile women with and without leiomyomas (including one randomized trial) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reproductive-issues-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Women with fibroids that were submucosal or intramural with an intracavitary component were less likely to become pregnant (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.18&ndash;0.74) and more likely to have a spontaneous abortion (RR 1.7, 95% CI 1.4&ndash;2.1). Consistent with these findings, women with cavity-distorting fibroids who did versus did not undergo myomectomy had a significant increase in conception rate (RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.08&ndash;3.83). Interestingly, there was no significant decrease in the risk of miscarriage in women who did versus did not undergo myomectomy (38.5 versus 50 percent; RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.36&ndash;1.66); however, this result was based on a single study of 52 women and lacks adequate statistical power [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reproductive-issues-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The data regarding intramural fibroids are less clear. Overall, studies of women with fibroids that did not distort the uterine cavity were less likely to become pregnant (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70&ndash;0.94) and more likely to have a spontaneous abortion (RR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2&ndash;2.5). However, most of these studies may have included women with fibroids causing intracavitary distortion since fibroid location was determined by imaging methods (HSG, ultrasound) less reliable than hysteroscopic documentation, thus biasing the results.</p><p>Clinical questions remain about the effects of intramural fibroid positions other than extension into the uterine cavity. As an example, it is possible that a fibroid near a fallopian tube ostium or near the cervix may impede fertilization. The two small series that evaluated whether treatment of occluding fibroids improves fertility reported conflicting results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reproductive-issues-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Couples should complete a full infertility evaluation before addressing the role of leiomyomas in their infertility. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Preparing for in vitro fertilization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effect of leiomyomas on IVF is dependent upon their location: submucosal myomas decrease the chance of success, whereas subserosal myomas do not appear to have any effect. Observational data suggest that intramural myomas may also have a negative impact on IVF outcomes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=in-vitro-fertilization#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;In vitro fertilization&quot;, section on 'Pre-cycle factors associated with success'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">OPTIONS FOR TREATMENT OF LEIOMYOMAS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most medical therapies for uterine leiomyomas preclude conception, cause adverse effects when employed long-term, and result in rapid symptom rebound when discontinued. Therefore, medical treatment of leiomyomas in infertile patients attempting to become pregnant is usually unsuccessful. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of treatment of uterine leiomyomas (fibroids)&quot;, section on 'Medical therapy'</a>.)</p><p>One medical treatment of uterine leiomyoma is a selective <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a> modulator, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ulipristal-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ulipristal</a>. It is associated with rapid decrease in uterine bleeding, slight reduction in myoma size, and minimal menopausal symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reproductive-issues-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. If needed, ulipristal can be administered for another three months after two menstrual periods. In our practice, we use 5 mg orally per day for three months, and the longest treatment has been four courses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Myomectomy versus embolization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We prefer myomectomy over uterine artery embolization (UAE) for treatment of most women with uterine leiomyomas who wish to conceive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reproductive-issues-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, we suggest UAE in women at high surgical risk, such as those with previous multiple laparotomies or diffuse uterine leiomyomas where myomectomy might not be technically feasible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-treatment-with-uterine-artery-embolization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine leiomyomas (fibroids): Treatment with uterine artery embolization&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We generally avoid UAE in women who wish to conceive because the safety of the procedure with respect to subsequent pregnancy outcome has not been established; fewer than 150 pregnancies following UAE have been reported. Cohort studies suggested that the miscarriage rate after UAE was higher than after myomectomy (17 to 30 versus 15 percent); the rate of preterm delivery was also higher following UAE than myomectomy (16 to 22 versus 3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reproductive-issues-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. In two studies, the rate of postpartum hemorrhage was high (18 versus 1 to 5 percent in the general obstetrical population), which could have been related to abnormal placentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reproductive-issues-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Interpretation of these data is limited because all of the studies involved a small number of patients and had no age-matched controls. Women in the UAE group were of older age, which could at least partially account for these results.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Route of myomectomy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Hysteroscopic myomectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hysteroscopic myomectomy is the procedure of choice for submucosal myomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reproductive-issues-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

The operative time, blood loss, and hospital stay are comparable to that with abdominal hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reproductive-issues-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The risk of unplanned hysterectomy at the time of myomectomy is less than 1 percent for experienced surgeons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reproductive-issues-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-myomectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal myomectomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>After abdominal myomectomy, the risk of uterine rupture prior to labor is very low (about 0.002 percent) compared to after classical cesarean delivery (about 3.7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reproductive-issues-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]), although these data are based upon small series without complete pregnancy follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reproductive-issues-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The common clinical practice of counseling women who have had a myomectomy with a transmural uterine incision to undergo an elective cesarean delivery clearly biases and under-reports the risk of rupture at term.</p><p>Women who undergo myomectomy with significant uterine disruption should wait several months before attempting to conceive; recommendations for delay range from three to six months. In addition, if a woman is having difficulty conceiving following a myomectomy, early assessment of the uterine cavity and fallopian tubes with a hysterosalpingogram is advisable to make sure there is no obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reproductive-issues-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Myomectomy, particularly near the oviduct, can cause adhesions that may impair fertility.</p><p>Pregnancy rates reported from 2 to 14 years after abdominal myomectomy range from 42 to 87 percent, depending on age and history of infertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reproductive-issues-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Laparoscopic myomectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With advances in laparoscopic suturing technique and instrumentation, most myomectomies can be performed laparoscopically. The results are comparable to those of myomectomy by laparotomy. Moreover, the laparoscopic approach is associated with faster recovery, and less adhesion formation. However, without proper suturing of the uterine defect, there is a risk of uterine rupture during the subsequent pregnancy or in labor. Multilayered closure and meticulous hemostasis are mandatory. Only surgeons who are familiar with laparoscopic suturing should perform laparoscopic myomectomy.

Factors reported to lead to an increased risk of conversion to an open procedure include size &ge;5.0 cm, intramural or anterior location, and preoperative use of a GnRH-agonist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reproductive-issues-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The magnitude of increased risk depends on the surgeon's experience and laparoscopic skills.</p><p>Whether reapproximation of the myometrium via laparoscopic suturing gives the uterine wall the same strength as multilayer closure at laparotomy is an area of controversy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reproductive-issues-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/20,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,24</a>]. Ten cases of uterine rupture in women who underwent laparoscopic myomectomy have been reported, one was at 17 weeks of gestation and the remainders were at 27 to 35.5 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reproductive-issues-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. On the other hand, one of the largest series of pregnancies after laparoscopic myomectomy reported no uterine ruptures in 106 deliveries; 27 of the deliveries were vaginal. Only 10 uterine cavities in this series had been entered at myomectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reproductive-issues-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].
