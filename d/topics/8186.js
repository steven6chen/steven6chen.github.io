The disease is mostly reported from Europe and North America, but is expected to occur in all ethnic groups. A prevalence of two per million was estimated in Denmark [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-coproporphyria/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In Europe, an incidence of approximately 0.15 new cases per year has been estimated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-coproporphyria/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Although acute attacks are generally milder than those seen in AIP, they can be severe and even fatal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-coproporphyria/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].

Urinary ALA and PBG are elevated during acute attacks, but elevations of these porphyrin precursors are less than those seen during attacks of AIP and decrease to normal more quickly. Elevation of urinary uroporphyrin accompanies the elevation of porphyrin precursors, as in AIP and VP. Uroporphyrin can form non-enzymatically from PBG in urine prior to voiding. It is also possible in this and other acute porphyrias that excess ALA transported to tissues other than the liver may re-enter the pathway to form excess porphyrinogens enzymatically.</p><p>In contrast to VP, plasma porphyrins are generally normal or only modestly increased in HCP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-coproporphyria/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], but are expected to be more elevated in the few patients who have cutaneous manifestations.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The excess coproporphyrin in urine and feces in HCP, with a marked predominance of isomer III, is distinctive.

The rare acute porphyria ALA dehydratase porphyria (ADP), which is also associated with acute neurovisceral attacks, is diagnosed in part by demonstrating increased levels of ALA and coproporphyrin III in the urine along with normal levels of PBG.

Not uncommonly, HCP is misdiagnosed in patients based solely on nonspecific urinary coproporphyrin elevations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26901919\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genetic testing for a CPOX mutation is appropriate to confirm the diagnosis of HCP in patients found to have elevated urinary and fecal coproporphyrin III (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F89036\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89036 \">table 4</a>). Genetic testing can also be used to confirm the diagnosis of HCP during an asymptomatic period, and to facilitate testing of asymptomatic family members for latent HCP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8012763\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major considerations in the differential diagnosis of HCP are other causes of abdominal pain, other causes of neuropathic or psychiatric symptoms, liver disease, and other acute porphyrias that can present with the same symptoms. Elevated urinary porphobilinogen (PBG) distinguishes HCP from non-porphyria conditions, and excretion patterns of heme intermediates (PBG, delta-aminolevulinic acid [ALA], porphyrins) distinguish the different acute porphyrias from each other.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other causes of abdominal pain</strong> &ndash; Abdominal pain can occur in numerous clinical settings and is often difficult to diagnose. Unlike HCP (and other acute porphyrias), other causes of abdominal pain do not cause elevations of urinary PBG. However, other causes of abdominal pain may be associated with elevations in urinary porphyrins (eg, hepatobiliary disease) or ALA (eg, lead poisoning). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with abdominal pain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-abdominal-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of abdominal pain in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Importantly, an individual known to have porphyria may present with another cause of abdominal pain (eg, appendicitis, diverticulitis, pancreatitis, inflammatory or ischemic bowel disease, renal stones), and these conditions can precipitate an acute porphyria attack. Therefore, an elevated PBG is diagnostic for acute porphyria but does not exclude these other conditions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other causes of neuropathy</strong> &ndash; Neuropathies can have a variety of clinical presentations and etiologies. Unlike HCP, other causes of neuropathy do not cause elevations of urinary PBG. However, lead poisoning causes elevations of urinary ALA and porphyrins. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-polyneuropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of polyneuropathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hereditary-neuropathies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hereditary neuropathies&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other causes of neuropsychiatric symptoms</strong> &ndash; There are a variety of causes of non-specific neuropsychiatric symptoms (eg, anxiety, agitation, insomnia, hallucinations). Examples include neurodegenerative disease, alcohol and drug use, psychiatric illness, and psychotropic medications. Like HCP, some of these other conditions may be associated with hyponatremia and the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH). Unlike HCP, these other causes of neuropsychiatric symptoms do not cause elevations of urinary PBG. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with visual hallucinations&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other causes of seizures</strong> &ndash; Seizures may occur in a setting of acute medical illness including hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, uremia, and drug or alcohol intake. Unlike acute porphyria, these other causes of seizures do not cause elevations in PBG. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-the-first-seizure-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of the first seizure in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Liver disease</strong> &ndash; Like HCP, liver disease may be associated with elevated urinary porphyrin excretion, especially coproporphyrin. This occurs because coproporphyrin is excreted in both bile and urine, and more appears in the urine when hepatobiliary function is impaired. Unlike HCP, patients with liver disease do not have elevated PBG, although they may have slight elevations in ALA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-abnormal-liver-biochemical-and-function-tests\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with abnormal liver biochemical and function tests&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other acute porphyrias</strong> &ndash; Like HCP, other acute porphyrias can cause acute attacks of abdominal and neuropsychiatric symptoms and increases in urinary porphyrin precursors (PBG, ALA) and porphyrins. Other acute porphyrias have different patterns of porphyrin precursors and porphyrins in blood, urine, erythrocytes, and stool (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F60572\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60572 \">table 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F89036\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89036 \">table 4</a>); and some have skin manifestations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F51032\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51032 \">table 7</a>). Because attacks of all acute porphyrias are treated in the same manner, it is not important to differentiate them before treatment is started; however, samples needed for differentiating these disorders should be collected before treatment. Genetic testing is best obtained after biochemical diagnosis of one of these acute porphyrias. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=porphyrias-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Porphyrias: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>AIP</strong> &ndash; Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is an acute porphyria like HCP. Of the two, AIP is more common. Like HCP, AIP is characterized by elevated urinary PBG, especially during an acute attack; PBG elevations may be higher in AIP than HCP. AIP is not associated with blistering photosensitivity, which occurs in a small proportion of HCP patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-intermittent-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute intermittent porphyria: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>VP</strong> &ndash; Variegate porphyria (VP) is an acute neurovisceral porphyria like HCP. Like HCP, VP is characterized by elevated urinary PBG, especially during an acute attack. VP commonly causes blistering photosensitivity much more often than HCP. VP is characterized by substantially increased fecal porphyrins, with a predominance of both coproporphyrin III and protoporphyrin, versus elevation of coproporphyrin III but much less elevation of protoporphyrin in HCP. Also, plasma porphyrins are often normal in HCP, but very likely to be increased in VP, with a characteristic peak fluorescence at approximately 626 nm when plasma is diluted at neutral pH; this finding distinguishes VP from all other types of porphyria. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=variegate-porphyria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Variegate porphyria&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>ADP</strong> &ndash; Delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase porphyria (ADP) is an acute neurovisceral porphyria like HCP. ADP is extremely rare. Unlike HCP, ADP is characterized by elevated urinary ALA rather than PBG, and markedly increased zinc protoporphyrin in erythrocytes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ala-dehydratase-porphyria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ALA dehydratase porphyria&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cutaneous porphyrias</strong> &ndash; Rarely, other blistering cutaneous porphyrias that can cause elevations in porphyrin levels, such as congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP), porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), and hepatoerythropoietic porphyria (HEP), may be misdiagnosed as HCP (or VP) if a concurrent condition is causing abdominal pain or other symptoms that suggest an acute porphyria. Erythropoietic protoporphyria causes nonblistering photosensitivity and can cause abdominal pain due to biliary stones or protoporphyric hepatopathy. Unlike HCP, patients with these cutaneous porphyrias lack elevations in urinary PBG. A biochemical evaluation will determine the type of acute porphyria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F89035\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef89035 \">algorithm 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F89123\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef89123 \">algorithm 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9950319\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9950328\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute attacks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of an acute attack in a patient newly diagnosed as having one of the acute porphyrias, based on a substantial increase in urinary PBG, can begin before the cause of the PBG elevation is determined to be AIP, HCP, or VP. If a patient with an established diagnosis of HCP and a history of prior attacks presents with recurrent symptoms, the diagnosis of an acute attack is based on clinical evaluation to determine whether the current presentation is similar to previous attacks, and to exclude other causes of the symptoms (eg, appendicitis, pancreatitis, etc.). </p><p>Prior laboratory documentation of HCP, including both biochemical and molecular confirmation, should be available to the treating physician from the medical records or from records provided by the patient. In such patients, it is advisable to obtain a spot urine for PBG, but in many instances treatment can be started before the result is available. In the absence of such prior documentation, an elevation in urinary PBG should be documented before initiating treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hemin</a>, unless delay would be potentially detrimental. </p><p>As in AIP, the preferred treatment for acute attacks is intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hemin</a>, although attacks that are mild (without pain requiring narcotics, hyponatremia, seizures or motor weakness) are sometimes treated with carbohydrate loading [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-coproporphyria/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].
