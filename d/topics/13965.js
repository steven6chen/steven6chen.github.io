Some disorders that cause hypoglycemia predominantly in the postprandial state are the noninsulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycemia syndrome (NIPHS), postgastric bypass hypoglycemia, and insulin autoimmune hypoglycemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F70726\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70726 \">table 1</a>). It is important to appreciate that sometimes patients are unable to differentiate fasting from postprandial occurrences of hypoglycemia, and some disorders can produce both fasting and postprandial hypoglycemia.</p><p>The diagnosis, evaluation, and management of patients with hypoglycemic symptoms that predominantly occur in the postprandial state will be reviewed here. Other causes of hypoglycemia and the diagnostic approach to hypoglycemia are discussed separately.

Its presence requires an evaluation to determine the cause of hypoglycemia.</p><p>The term reactive hypoglycemia is often erroneously used to describe a functional or idiopathic disorder observed in patients with nondescript postprandial symptoms and no biochemical evidence of hypoglycemia after ingestion of a high carbohydrate meal and with resolution of symptoms after dietary modification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postprandial-reactive-hypoglycemia/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>] (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Postprandial syndrome'</a> below). The danger in considering postprandial (reactive) hypoglycemia as a disease itself, rather than a descriptor of the timing of hypoglycemia, is the failure to search for the underlying cause of the hypoglycemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Postprandial syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the remote past, patients with symptoms suggestive of increased sympathetic activity (anxiety, weakness, tremor, perspiration, or palpitations) occurring after meals were considered to have functional hyperinsulinism or functional hypoglycemia, as a reaction to the ingestion of food. The diagnosis was based upon reproduction of the patient's hypoglycemia symptoms in association with a blood glucose value of &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> after an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postprandial-reactive-hypoglycemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, the value of an OGTT in diagnosing reactive hypoglycemia has been discredited based upon the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At least 10 percent of normal subjects have nadir blood glucose concentrations less than 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> during a four-to-six-hour OGTT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postprandial-reactive-hypoglycemia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no correlation between blood glucose concentrations and the occurrence of symptoms during the test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postprandial-reactive-hypoglycemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], and any abnormalities are poorly reproducible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postprandial-reactive-hypoglycemia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many patients with postprandial adrenergic symptoms have similar symptoms after administration of a placebo instead of glucose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postprandial-reactive-hypoglycemia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum cortisol or epinephrine concentrations often do not increase when blood glucose concentrations are low or symptoms are present, suggesting that the fall in blood glucose was not sufficient to activate counterregulation and making it difficult to relate the symptoms to autonomic activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postprandial-reactive-hypoglycemia/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiologic response to hypoglycemia in normal subjects and patients with diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study in which plasma glucose responses to a mixed meal were compared with those after oral glucose administration, none of the patients who had plasma glucose values less than 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> after oral glucose had hypoglycemia after a mixed meal or any electroencephalography (EEG) evidence of hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postprandial-reactive-hypoglycemia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In this and other reports, the patient's typical symptoms occurred during both tests even though there was no hypoglycemia after the mixed meal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72850\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72850 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postprandial-reactive-hypoglycemia/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. These findings provide especially strong evidence that OGTTs should not be performed as part of the evaluation of patients with symptoms of hypoglycemia in the postprandial period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postprandial-reactive-hypoglycemia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Few patients who have symptoms suggestive of postprandial hypoglycemia have low blood glucose concentrations at those times, as measured in central laboratories on self-collected capillary specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postprandial-reactive-hypoglycemia/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].</p><p/><p>Because of the above findings, many experts do not believe that functional hypoglycemia is a true hypoglycemic disorder. This disorder is sometimes referred to as postprandial syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postprandial-reactive-hypoglycemia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of a postprandial hypoglycemic disorder cannot be diagnosed solely on the basis of postprandial sympathoadrenal symptoms. Postprandial sympathoadrenal symptoms may be highly suggestive of hypoglycemia, but they cannot be ascribed to hypoglycemia unless the glucose concentration is low (&lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [2.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> at the same time, and the symptoms are relieved when it is raised. This triad of symptoms is called Whipple's triad:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A low plasma glucose concentration measured with a precise method (not a glucose monitor)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relief of those symptoms after the plasma glucose level is raised</p><p/><p>Only those patients in whom Whipple's triad is documented require evaluation and management of hypoglycemia.

When this has been performed in patients with postprandial sympathoadrenal symptoms, the glucose concentrations have almost invariably been normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postprandial-reactive-hypoglycemia/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. On careful evaluation, most patients with these symptoms after meals have some type of psychoneurosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postprandial-reactive-hypoglycemia/abstract/6,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,17,18</a>].</p><p>However, patients who have documented biochemical hypoglycemia (plasma glucose &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [2.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> at the time of the postprandial symptoms or have neuroglycopenic symptoms after meals require a comprehensive evaluation for a hypoglycemic disorder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypoglycemia-in-adults-without-diabetes-mellitus-diagnostic-approach#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypoglycemia in adults without diabetes mellitus: Diagnostic approach&quot;, section on 'Approach to testing'</a>.)</p><p>Patients should be evaluated in the postprandial state either during the occurrence of spontaneous symptoms or during a mixed meal test. For a mixed meal diagnostic test, the patient consumes a meal of solid and liquid composition that usually leads to symptoms and is then observed for up to five hours. Patients who have had Roux-en-Y gastric bypass should have a test meal that is appropriate for post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass patients; they should avoid caloric intake in liquid form. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postgastrectomy-complications#H8245417\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postgastrectomy complications&quot;, section on 'Dumping syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>Samples are collected for plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin prior to ingestion of the meal and every 30 minutes thereafter for five hours. If severe symptoms occur prior to five hours, samples for the above lab tests should be collected before the administration of carbohydrates (to assess for correction of symptoms). All glucose samples are sent for analysis. Analysis of the samples for insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin may be limited to those in which plasma glucose is &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [3.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]</span> as a cost-saving effort (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F56314\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56314 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>If Whipple's triad is demonstrated, sulfonylureas, meglitinides, and antibodies to insulin should also be measured. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypoglycemia-in-adults-without-diabetes-mellitus-diagnostic-approach#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypoglycemia in adults without diabetes mellitus: Diagnostic approach&quot;, section on 'Postprandial evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Although standards for the interpretation of the mixed meal test have not been established from the study of volunteers with non-insulin-mediated postprandial hypoglycemia, it is reasonable to assume that, in subjects with an intact upper gastrointestinal tract, hypoglycemia should not occur. The interpretation of beta-cell polypeptides (insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin) in the postprandial period is more difficult as concentrations represent the net sum of secretion and clearance. C-peptide has a half-life of approximately 35 minutes, whereas insulin has a half-life of approximately 5 minutes. Therefore, elevations of beta-cell polypeptides in the postprandial period may represent incomplete clearance after secretion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypoglycemia-in-adults-without-diabetes-mellitus-diagnostic-approach#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypoglycemia in adults without diabetes mellitus: Diagnostic approach&quot;, section on 'Interpretation of data'</a>.)</p><p>An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) done in an effort to replicate postprandial symptoms should not be performed, because misleading results may be obtained. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Postprandial syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postprandial (reactive) hypoglycemia is a descriptor of the timing of hypoglycemia (within four hours after meals) and is not a diagnosis per se.

(See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Postprandial syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p>Symptoms ascribed to but never confirmed as hypoglycemia have been reported in 5 to 37 percent of patients who have undergone upper gastrointestinal surgery (gastrectomy, gastroenterostomy, or vagotomy and pyloroplasty) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postprandial-reactive-hypoglycemia/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. These symptoms were of the autonomic type and occurred approximately one to two hours after eating. Among patients who had one of these operations, blood glucose values less than 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> after oral glucose administration were more common than symptoms considered to be due to hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postprandial-reactive-hypoglycemia/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. These observations should not be construed as a denial of the existence of postprandial hypoglycemia when properly diagnosed.</p><p>The dumping syndrome should be distinguished from hypoglycemia although it causes similar symptoms. The dumping syndrome occurs early (within one hour after eating), is not associated with hypoglycemia, and is presumed to be caused by contraction of the plasma volume due to fluid shifts into the gastrointestinal tract.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Post-bariatric surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients who have undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass as treatment for morbid obesity have experienced postprandial hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postprandial-reactive-hypoglycemia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Insulin secreted in response to a meal binds to the antibody and then (it is proposed) disassociates in an unregulated fashion causing late postprandial hyperinsulinemia and hypoglycemia. In addition to a history of postprandial symptoms, diagnostic clues include evidence of other autoimmune phenomena and very high plasma total insulin concentrations.

These histologic findings are characteristic of nesidioblastosis, a term that refers to neoformation of islets of Langerhans from pancreatic duct epithelium.</p><p>The predominant clinical feature of NIPHS is postprandial hypoglycemia, occurring two to four hours after meals.

However, blood glucose concentrations have rarely been measured during spontaneously occurring symptoms in these patients.
