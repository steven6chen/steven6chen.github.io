It is characterized by headache that is often throbbing in character and accompanied by symptoms such as photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, vomiting, and movement sensitivity.</p><p>The epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of migraine headaches in children are reviewed here. Classification and treatment of migraine headaches in children and an approach to the general evaluation of headaches in children are discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-migraine-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of migraine in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Migraine is thought to have a polygenetic and multifactorial etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Despite the strong genetic underpinnings of migraine, the specific genes underlying migraine have not been fully delineated, with the exception of the rare subform of familial hemiplegic migraine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemiplegic-migraine#H81876416\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemiplegic migraine&quot;, section on 'Familial hemiplegic migraine'</a>.)</p><p>No single theory or hypothesis has yet explained all of the phenomena that occur with migraine. The once popular vascular theory of migraine, which suggested that the headaches were caused by the dilatation of blood vessels while the aura resulted from vasoconstriction, has been discredited. In spontaneous migraine attacks imaged with magnetic resonance angiography, there is no extracranial artery dilation and only minimal intracranial artery dilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Successful treatment of the attacks with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sumatriptan-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sumatriptan</a> did not cause intracranial vasoconstriction. The throbbing nature of migraine head pain does not represent perception of one's own arterial pulse, as the throbbing percept rhythm and the arterial pulse rhythm are distinct from, and out of phase with, one another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A central oscillation in nociceptive processing may underlie the throbbing percept of migraine head pain. </p><p>The mechanism appears to be a primary neuronal dysfunction that leads to an increased sensitivity to a broad range of stimuli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A genetic predisposition can make individuals susceptible to an acute migraine attack, depending upon the balance between excitation and inhibition at various levels of the nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Both genetic and environmental factors are likely to be important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>A primary event may occur in the brainstem involving diffuse projections from the locus ceruleus to other parts of the brain. This causes an unstable trigeminovascular reflex, and allows excessive discharge of part of the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve and basal thalamic nuclei. Support for this role of the brainstem is derived from a study that used positron emission tomography to examine changes in regional cerebral blood flow as an index of neuronal activity in the human brain during spontaneous migraine attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. During the attacks, increased blood flow was found in the cerebral hemispheres in the cingulate, auditory, and visual association cortices, and in the brainstem. However, only the brainstem activation persisted after the injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sumatriptan-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sumatriptan</a> had induced complete relief from headache, phonophobia, and photophobia. These findings support the idea that the pathogenesis of migraine is related to an imbalance in activity in the brainstem and other areas.</p><p>Antidromic stimulation of the trigeminal nerve results in the release of substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and other vasoactive polypeptides that cause pain and vasodilatation in experimental models, and lead to the sequence of events labeled as &quot;neurogenic inflammation.&quot; Locus ceruleus projections to the cerebral cortex may initiate cortical hypoperfusion and spreading depression, which can explain the aura of migraine. One group of investigators has established a causal link between the aura and headache by providing evidence that cortical spreading depression, a wave of neuronal depolarization that spreads across the cerebral cortex and is thought to cause aura, activates trigeminal nerve afferents that, through central and peripheral reflex mechanisms, cause inflammatory changes in the pain-sensitive meninges to generate the headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A second group has also reported temporary sensitization of central trigeminal neurons during acute migraine attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Cortical spreading depression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is thought to be the underlying cause of migraine aura [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

The exact mechanism of serotonin action is obscure. A decline in serotonergic function has been noted during acute migraine attacks in adults, resulting in vasodilation of cranial vessels and sensitization of meningeal afferents of the trigeminal nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Between attacks, patients who have migraine without aura appear to have increased brain serotonin synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Prophylactic antimigraine drugs may act via centrally modulating serotonergic neuronal networks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], while abortive medications such as triptans terminate migraine attacks through agonist activity at certain serotonin receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Beta blocking drugs used for migraine prophylaxis may regulate serotonin synthesis through action at the serotonin receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of CGRP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is thought to play a central role in migraine pathophysiology. CGRP is a 37 amino acid neuropeptide that is expressed in trigeminal ganglia nerves and is enriched in dural nerves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>].</p><p>CGRP is involved in pain signaling both within the peripheral and central nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. An infusion of CGRP can trigger a migraine attack in migraineurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. CGRP levels have been reported to be elevated during migraine attacks in both adults and children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/20,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,23</a>], and higher in adults with chronic migraine compared with those who have episodic migraine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. An elevated CGRP level during acute migraine may predict response to triptans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Elevated CGRP levels are normalized in migraine patients following administration of the serotonin <span class=\"nowrap\">1B/1D</span> receptor agonist <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sumatriptan-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sumatriptan</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], suggesting that triptans may act to control migraine at least in part by reducing CGRP levels. Monoclonal antibodies to CGRP are under development and have shown promise in preliminary studies for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Right to left cardiac shunt</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A few studies in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>] and children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>] have suggested that migraine with aura is associated with right to left cardiac shunts, usually in the setting of a patent foramen ovale or, much less often, an atrial septal defect. It may simply be that this is an association without causation, as there is no compelling evidence that closure of a patent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect is effective treatment for migraine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preventive-treatment-of-migraine-in-adults#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preventive treatment of migraine in adults&quot;, section on 'Closure of right-to-left cardiac shunt'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3765709169\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Migraine occurs at all ages and may even begin in infancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. The prevalence of migraine increases throughout childhood and in particular during adolescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. By age 10, the prevalence of migraine is approximately 5 percent. The prevalence of migraine may be as high as 2.5 percent of children less than seven years of age. Prior to puberty girls and boys are affected equally; during puberty migraine starts to affect more girls than boys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Family history is positive in the majority of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].</p><p>Chronic migraine, meaning migraine occurring at least 15 days per month for at least three months, affects approximately 1 to 2 percent of adolescents aged 12 to 17 years and &lt;1 percent of schoolchildren 5 to 12 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. Chronic migraine is associated with more missed school and poorer performance in school. Children from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds are at higher risk of developing chronic migraine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Episodic migraine is a disorder of recurrent attacks, while chronic migraine is headache that occurs &ge;15 days per month for &ge;3 months, with &ge;8 days per month meeting criteria for migraine. Migraine attacks unfold through a cascade of events that occur over the course of hours to days. A typical attack of migraine without aura progresses through three phases: the premonitory phase, the headache phase, and the postdrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. In an attack of migraine with aura, the aura is an additional phase that may occur before or with the headache, as at least in adults the headache is already present during aura in a majority of attacks. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults#H203275055\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of migraine in adults&quot;, section on 'Migraine aura'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H483945917\"><span class=\"h2\">Premonitory phase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The premonitory phase of migraine consists of affective, vegetative, and sensitivity symptoms that appear hours to even a day prior to the onset of the headache phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>]. Frequently reported premonitory symptoms include euphoria, fatigue, irritability, social withdrawal, food cravings, urinary or bowel changes, neck stiffness, and increased yawning. The prevalence of premonitory symptoms in pediatric migraine needs further investigation, but one study of pediatric migraineurs noted that at least one premonitory symptom was reported by 67 percent of subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The most commonly experienced symptoms were fatigue, irritability, and face changes such as pallor or shadows under the eyes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H483946002\"><span class=\"h2\">Migraine aura</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aura, when it occurs, is most often visual. A slowly enlarging scotoma, scintillations, and fortification spectra (ie, a jagged line, typically black and white and crescent shaped) are the most common manifestations. Other forms of aura include sensory, language, motor, brainstem-type, and retinal. &#160;</p><p>As cortical spreading depression is thought to underlie aura, key clinical features of aura are spread and progression. The slow spread of positive symptoms (scintillations or tingling) followed by negative symptoms (scotoma or numbness) is quite characteristic of migraine aura [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The aura symptom should spread over at least five minutes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> there should be progression from one symptom to the next (eg, from visual to sensory) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Therefore, the migraineur who simply sees a flash of light for a few seconds would not be considered to have aura. The most typical duration of aura is 5 to 60 minutes. However about one-quarter of migraineurs will experience aura symptoms that last longer than an hour with at least some of their attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>A sensory aura usually begins as a tingling in one limb or on one side of the face. As the tingling sensation migrates across one side of the face or down the limb, numbness is left in its wake and may last up to an hour. The sensory aura may also move inside the mouth, affecting the buccal mucosa and half the tongue.</p><p>Language or dysphasic auras may range from mild wording difficulties to frank dysphasia with paraphasic errors. This symptom can sometimes be challenging to distinguish from concentration problems that begin in the premonitory phase. In motor aura, the limbs and possibly the face on one side of the body become weak. Motor aura is separated out from the other forms of aura and classified as hemiplegic migraine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemiplegic-migraine\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemiplegic migraine&quot;</a>.)</p><p>While aura can precede headache, headache is most often already present during aura [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In fact, the headache can begin before, during, or after the aura [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Therapeutically, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sumatriptan-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sumatriptan</a> response rates appear to be slightly lower in adults with migraine with aura [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. As stroke risk is slightly elevated in young women who have migraine with aura, and the risk is increased further with use of estrogen-containing contraceptives, there should be careful counseling about potential risks and benefits of oral contraceptive pill use in adolescent girls who have migraine with aura [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>Children should be asked specifically if they see anything unusual at the beginning of their headache.

However, the symptoms of migraine vary with age. In toddlers, who generally are unable to voice complaints about headache, symptoms appreciated by caregivers include episodic pallor, unusual decreased activity, and vomiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/34,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,51</a>].

The International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition (ICHD-3) diagnostic criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F50876\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50876 \">table 1</a>) note that certain features of migraine in children may differ from typical features in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Migraine attacks may last 2 to 72 hours</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Migraine headache is often bilateral in children, and an adult pattern of unilateral pain usually emerges in late adolescence or early adulthood</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Photophobia and phonophobia may be inferred from behavior in young children</p><p/><p>The ICHD-3 criteria provide a reasonable guide to migraine headache characteristics in children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F50876\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50876 \">table 1</a>). However, because the ICHD-3 criteria require at least five attacks to fulfill the diagnosis of migraine, they may have suboptimal sensitivity in the setting of the emergency department, where children may be more likely to present with a first episode of moderate to severe headache. In the emergency department setting, diagnostic emphasis is usually on ruling out dangerous secondary causes of headache.</p><p>Headache drawings may be a useful adjunct to the history and physical examination in differentiating migraine from nonmigraine headaches. In one study, pediatric neurologists masked to the clinical history evaluated pictures drawn by 226 children, ages 4 to 19 years, illustrating how their headache felt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Drawings with features consistent with migraine (eg, pounding pain, <span class=\"nowrap\">nausea/vomiting,</span> photophobia) had a sensitivity and specificity of 93.1 and 82.7 percent and a positive predictive value of 87.1 percent for migraine.</p><p>The child should have normal general physical and neurologic examinations. Children with an established history (more than six months) of typical intermittent headaches and a normal examination usually do not need neuroimaging. Imaging should be performed if there are abnormal neurologic examination findings, or features of the history concerning for elevated intracranial pressure such as diplopia, ataxia, or worsening of headache when supine. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuroimaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no specific neuroimaging findings associated with migraine in children. In a retrospective case-control study, incidental white matter lesions were slightly more common among pediatric patients who had migraine with aura compared with controls (10 versus 4 percent), but the difference was not statistically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>Most patients with a history of migraine headaches and no signs or symptoms of neurologic dysfunction or increased intracranial pressure do not need neuroimaging.</p><p>The American Academy of Neurology, American Academy of Family Physicians, American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine, and four other groups formed a consortium that took an evidence-based approach to evaluating the need for brain imaging in patients with headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. This report noted that the odds of finding a significant abnormality on neuroimaging in patients with nonacute headache were increased by the following symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapidly increasing headache frequency</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of lack of coordination</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of localized neurologic signs or subjective numbness or tingling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of headache causing awakening from sleep (although this can occur with migraine headache)</p><p/><p>However, the odds of finding a significant abnormality were not lowered by the absence of these symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>The consortium recommended that neuroimaging is usually not warranted in patients whose history is consistent with migraine and who have a normal neurologic examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. In addition, data were insufficient to make a specific recommendation regarding the relative sensitivity of MRI compared with CT in patients who have an imaging study performed. However, given the potential radiation risks of CT, MRI is generally preferable in the nonemergent imaging of children with headache. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory testing rarely is helpful in the evaluation of childhood headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/60-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-63</a>]. In children with complicated syndromes or migraine variants, testing will depend upon the differential diagnosis. Lumbar puncture (LP) may be necessary to diagnose an intracranial infection or increased intracranial pressure.

Useful features for distinguishing these various types of transient neurologic attacks include the nature of the symptoms, their progression, duration and timing, associated symptoms during and after the attacks, and presence of focal or nonfocal symptoms. The symptoms of TIA and migraine are fully reversible, and neuroimaging is often unrevealing in both conditions. However, both a TIA and an ischemic stroke typically have a sudden onset of symptoms rather than a gradual progressive spread of one aura symptom after another. Ischemic events are also less likely to have positive symptoms such as visual scintillations or paresthesia, and are less likely to have migrainous symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia.
