Medical thoracoscopy is most commonly used for pleural fluid drainage, pleural biopsy, and pleurodesis. Although the equipment and some applications are similar to those used in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), it is typically more limited in its diagnostic and therapeutic functions and performed by pulmonologists, thus the term &quot;medical&quot; thoracoscopy. While its use varies among clinicians and countries, this review is limited to its most common applications. </p><p>The indications and contraindications for medical thoracoscopy are discussed in this review while the technique, equipment, and complications are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-thoracoscopy-pleuroscopy-equipment-procedure-and-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical thoracoscopy (pleuroscopy): Equipment, procedure, and complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2792540739\"><span class=\"h1\">COMMON APPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medical thoracoscopy is generally a second line tool for diagnostic or therapeutic procedures of the pleura. It should not replace preliminary diagnostic approaches, including thoracentesis for the evaluation of a pleural effusion or bronchoscopy for the evaluation of pulmonary parenchymal processes. For patients in whom parietal pleural biopsy is indicated, whether closed needle biopsy should be done before thoracoscopic biopsy is not clearly established. However, most experts prefer thoracoscopy given the higher diagnostic yield, ability to simultaneously perform additional procedures (eg, drainage and pleurodesis) and waning expertise in closed needle biopsy. However, image-guided (ultrasound or computed tomography)-closed needle biopsy may be preferred in cases where thoracoscopy is unavailable. Similarly, for those with pleural effusions in whom chemical pleurodesis is indicated, choosing whether to deliver sclerosant via a chest tube (slurry) or a thoracoscope (poudrage) is unclear and usually depends upon the medical circumstances (eg, medical condition, physical performance status), goals and preferences of the patient, and institutional practice. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of malignant pleural effusions&quot;, section on 'Pleurodesis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-refractory-nonmalignant-pleural-effusions#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of refractory nonmalignant pleural effusions&quot;, section on 'Pleurodesis'</a>.) &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic evaluation of an exudative pleural effusion of unknown etiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medical thoracoscopy is most commonly performed when multiple attempts at thoracentesis (typically two) have failed to achieve a diagnosis in patients with an exudative pleural effusion of unclear etiology. This approach, which is supported by the 2010 British Thoracic Society Pleural Disease Guideline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-thoracoscopy-pleuroscopy-diagnostic-and-therapeutic-applications/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>], is based upon the high diagnostic accuracy of thoracoscopic biopsy in this setting compared with closed needle or image-guided biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-thoracoscopy-pleuroscopy-diagnostic-and-therapeutic-applications/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Choosing among medical thoracoscopy or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is dependent upon the complexity of the procedure, the possible need for concurrent minimally invasive surgery, as well as institutional expertise. Medical thoracoscopy can be safely performed in those who have an uncomplicated pleural space in whom no additional surgery (eg, lobectomy, wedge resection, decortication) is anticipated while VATS may be preferred in those with a complicated pleural space (eg, multiple adhesions), those in whom concurrent additional surgery is anticipated, or when medical thoracoscopy is not available.

In addition, fluid can be completely drained from the pleural space and biopsies can be taken under direct visualization from involved and uninvolved parts of the parietal, and less commonly, visceral pleural membrane. </p><p>Endoscopic characteristics of pleural malignancy include nodules, polypoid lesions, and &quot;candle wax drops&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F114104\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114104 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F114103\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114103 \">picture 2</a>).

Pleural effusions due to lung cancer (usually non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC]) represent M1a disease (ie, unresectable disease). Repeated thoracocentesis is nondiagnostic in about one-third of patients with suspected NSCLC, thereby necessitating pleural biopsy. Thoracoscopic biopsy (medical or VATS) in this setting is preferred rather than image-guided or closed needle biopsy since it has a higher diagnostic sensitivity (up to 98 percent). In most cases confirmation of cancer leads to accurate staging and molecular genotyping, resulting in appropriate therapy, and in rare cases when no evidence of pleural cancer is found, it may open up the possibility of curative resection. Data supporting this approach are discussed separately.

Repeated thoracentesis has a low sensitivity (&lt;35 percent) and closed needle biopsy specimens are rarely of sufficient size to allow a definitive histologic diagnosis. Even by thoracoscopy, the accuracy of diagnosing mesothelioma may be lower than that for lung cancer due to inadequate visualization due to extensive adhesions or the nonspecific appearance of lesions (affected regions may appear as areas of inflammation) and inherent difficulties in pathological identification of the tumor. </p><p>The historical gold standard for diagnosis of pleural mesothelioma was open biopsy but this procedure is associated with significant morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-thoracoscopy-pleuroscopy-diagnostic-and-therapeutic-applications/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Thus, in an effort to avoid this morbidity, most experts use thoracoscopy first for diagnosis. While some older studies reported that a diagnosis was established thoracoscopically in 60 to 75 percent of patients with mesothelioma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-thoracoscopy-pleuroscopy-diagnostic-and-therapeutic-applications/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>], newer studies suggest that larger specimen size taken with a 5-mm or 7-mm rigid forceps may be comparable with open biopsy and in the 90 percent range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-thoracoscopy-pleuroscopy-diagnostic-and-therapeutic-applications/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Some experts use newer instruments including an insulated tip knife (via a semi-rigid thoracoscope) or a cryobiopsy forceps, although the diagnostic accuracy of these tools are uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-thoracoscopy-pleuroscopy-diagnostic-and-therapeutic-applications/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].

Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has a well-established role in the performance of these procedures since they are in general more complicated, more invasive, and may require additional interventions for complications such as air leak or hemorrhage and need deeper anesthesia than that typically provided during medical thoracoscopy.

Medical thoracoscopic lung biopsy can help establish the diagnosis of diffuse pulmonary disease, pulmonary infiltrates, or peripheral lesions of unknown cause. In addition, it can provide tissue for microbiologic or mineralogic studies, when either pulmonary infection or pneumoconiosis is being considered. The main advantage compared with bronchoscopy is that thoracoscopy provides larger biopsy specimens and the biopsy can be directed to abnormal areas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-lung-biopsy-in-the-diagnosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of lung biopsy in the diagnosis of interstitial lung disease&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Compared with VATS, data are limited to support the use of medical thoracoscopy in this setting. Two older retrospective studies reported a sensitivity that ranged from 70 percent for localized peripheral lesions to 100 percent for diffuse lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-thoracoscopy-pleuroscopy-diagnostic-and-therapeutic-applications/abstract/23,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,26</a>]. In a retrospective study of 118 samples from 24 consecutive patients with interstitial lung disease, biopsy findings plus clinical and radiologic data revealed a relevant diagnosis in 75 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-thoracoscopy-pleuroscopy-diagnostic-and-therapeutic-applications/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p>Although one concern is that hemorrhage and air leak may be more difficult to manage with medical thoracoscopy compared with VATS, limited data suggest that these complications are negligible if the biopsy site has been adequately secured with staples or cautery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-thoracoscopy-pleuroscopy-diagnostic-and-therapeutic-applications/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Until this role is clarified, chest tube drainage (with or without fibrinolysis) followed by VATS (when chest tube drainage is insufficient), is the approach of choice. The management of parapneumonic effusions and empyema are discussed in detail separately.

Medical thoracoscopy is most commonly used for pleural fluid drainage, pleural biopsy, and pleurodesis. Although the equipment and some applications are similar to those used in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), it is typically more limited in its diagnostic and therapeutic functions and performed by pulmonologists, thus the term &quot;medical&quot; thoracoscopy. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common indication for medical thoracoscopy is the acquisition of parietal pleural biopsy in patients with an exudative pleural effusion of unclear etiology in whom multiple attempts at thoracentesis (typically two) have failed to achieve a diagnosis. This approach is based upon the high diagnostic accuracy of thoracoscopic biopsy in this setting compared with closed needle or image-guided biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-thoracoscopy-pleuroscopy-diagnostic-and-therapeutic-applications/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Choosing between medical thoracoscopy or VATS is dependent upon the complexity of the procedure, the possible need for concurrent minimally invasive surgery, as well as institutional expertise. Diagnostic yields are best for lung cancer (sensitivity up to 98 percent) and tuberculosis (94 to 100 percent) and lower for mesothelioma (75 to 90 percent). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation of an exudative pleural effusion of unknown etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical thoracoscopy can also be used to perform chemical pleurodesis, most often with talc, for recurrent malignant or benign pleural effusion. (See <a href=\"#H4076148666\" class=\"local\">'Chemical pleurodesis for recurrent pleural effusion'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chemical-pleurodesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chemical pleurodesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=talc-pleurodesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Talc pleurodesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical thoracoscopy is rarely used for lung biopsy, blebectomy, pleural abrasion, drainage of a complicated parapneumonic effusion, foreign body removal, or sympathectomy, although practice may differ among clinicians and regions in this regard. VATS has a well-established role in the performance of these procedures since they are in general more complicated, more invasive, and may require additional interventions for complications such as air leak or hemorrhage and need deeper anesthesia than that typically provided during medical thoracoscopy. (See <a href=\"#H3423662840\" class=\"local\">'Uncommon applications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complex minimally invasive thoracic surgical procedures are not generally performed by medical thoracoscopy but are reserved for surgeons skilled in VATS. These include lobectomy, pneumonectomy, pleurectomy, decortication, wedge resection, vagotomy, pericardial window, bronchopleural fistula repair, and evaluation of mediastinal tumors or lymphadenopathy.
