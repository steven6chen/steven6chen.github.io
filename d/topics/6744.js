Most cases of acute pharyngitis are caused by respiratory viruses and are self-limited. However, symptoms of viral pharyngitis broadly overlap with pharyngitis caused by important treatable causes, such as group A <em>Streptococcus </em>(GAS). Using a systematic approach to diagnosis can help reduce inappropriate antibiotic use by identifying which patients require testing and treatment for GAS and can also help determine which patients have serious conditions, such as acute HIV infection, or life-threatening complications, such as airway obstruction.</p><p>The epidemiology, clinical features, and evaluation of acute pharyngitis in adults are reviewed here. The treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis and the symptomatic management of pharyngitis are discussed separately.

The two most common infectious causes are respiratory viruses and group A <em>Streptococcus</em> (GAS).</p><p>Most patients with pharyngitis of any cause present with a sore throat that worsens when swallowing. Neck pain or swelling due to regional lymphadenopathy commonly accompany sore throat. Fever, headache, fatigue, and malaise are variably present. The specific microbiologic cause of pharyngitis can rarely be distinguished based on clinical features alone. However, understanding the relative prevalence of the causes of pharyngitis and their clinical features can help focus evaluation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2487425990\"><span class=\"h2\">Infectious causes</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3290921889\"><span class=\"h3\">Respiratory viruses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Respiratory viruses are the most common causes of acute pharyngitis, accounting for approximately 25 to 45 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-acute-pharyngitis-in-adults/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. Adenovirus, rhinovirus, and coronaviruses are among the leading causes of viral pharyngitis. Other respiratory viruses that cause pharyngitis include enteroviruses, influenza A and B, parainfluenza viruses, and respiratory syncytial virus.</p><p>Patients with pharyngitis caused by respiratory viruses usually have other signs and symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection, such as fatigue, nasal congestion, and cough. Coryza, conjunctivitis, sneezing, hoarseness, ear pain, sinus discomfort, oral ulcers, and a viral exanthem (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F83682\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83682 \">picture 1</a>) are additional features that support the diagnosis of viral pharyngitis. Fever associated with viral upper respiratory tract infection is typically low grade except in patients with influenza. Cervical lymphadenopathy may be present but is generally not prominent.

Suppurative complications of GAS pharyngitis are due to invasion of the organism beyond the pharynx and include otitis media, peritonsillar cellulitis or abscess, sinusitis, meningitis, bacteremia, and necrotizing fasciitis. Nonsuppurative complications of GAS pharyngitis are immune mediated and include acute rheumatic fever, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, and reactive arthritis. Prevention of these complications is a key reason for treating GAS pharyngitis with antibiotics.

Pharyngitis caused by group C or G <em>Streptococcus</em> is clinically indistinguishable from GAS pharyngitis.

Pharyngitis caused by <em>A. haemolyticum</em> is similar to streptococcal pharyngitis and is most common in adolescents and young adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-acute-pharyngitis-in-adults/abstract/9,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,17,18</a>].

Thus, it is possible that the organism's ecologic niche broadens with pharyngeal inflammation and that <em>F. necrophorum</em> is a secondary invader rather than a causative pathogen. By contrast, <em>F. necrophorum</em> plays a causal role in Lemierre syndrome (septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein).

The clinical syndrome of diphtheria is characterized by pharyngitis, low-grade fever, malaise, and cervical lymphadenopathy. Symptom onset is usually gradual. The hallmark of diphtheria, the formation of a tightly adherent gray membrane that bleeds when dislodged, occurs in at least one-third of patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F52701\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52701 \">picture 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F51058\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51058 \">picture 6</a>).

Testing for GAS or other pathogens is not needed, unless risk factors for a specific treatable cause are present (eg, risk factors for sexually transmitted infections). (See <a href=\"#H7331955\" class=\"local\">'Identifying patients with respiratory viral syndromes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testing for GAS is indicated for patients who have a clinical syndrome compatible with GAS pharyngitis (eg, fever, tonsillar exudates, and cervical lymphadenopathy) and lack features of a viral upper respiratory tract infection. When the need for testing is unclear based on clinical features alone, we use the Centor criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F116709\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116709 \">table 8</a>) to help guide our decision. We generally test for streptococcal pharyngitis in patients with &ge;3 Centor criteria. (See <a href=\"#H2463144321\" class=\"local\">'Determining whom to test for GAS'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using a sensitive rapid antigen test (RADT) alone is usually sufficient for diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis. Follow-up throat culture is reserved for selected patients who are at high risk for complications, those who are in close contact with persons at high risk for complications, or for persons who live in areas where the prevalence of GAS <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> acute rheumatic fever is high. (See <a href=\"#H3083859811\" class=\"local\">'Testing for GAS'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation should also include a sexual history (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61677\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61677 \">table 9</a>) and assessment of risk factors for HIV. While HIV and sexually transmitted infections are uncommon causes of acute pharyngitis, these are treatable conditions with important public health implications. (See <a href=\"#H133296471\" class=\"local\">'Assessing risk for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although rare, recognizing signs and symptoms of severe or invasive infections and upper airway obstruction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F116703\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116703 \">table 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F116704\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116704 \">table 6</a>) is a critical part of evaluation. Patients with these signs and symptoms may require urgent stabilization <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> referral to an emergency or inpatient setting for additional care. (See <a href=\"#H470178587\" class=\"local\">'Need for urgent management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of patients presenting to clinical care with acute pharyngitis can be clinically diagnosed with respiratory viral syndrome <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> test negative for GAS. These patients typically recover within five to seven days without specific treatment. Patients with GAS pharyngitis usually recover soon, often within 24 to 72 hours of starting antibiotics. Failure to improve within these time periods should raise suspicion for alternative diagnoses or complications. (See <a href=\"#H1267190836\" class=\"local\">'Testing for other pathogens'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3853427060\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-acute-pharyngitis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Schappert SM, Rechtsteiner EA.
