Nephrocalcinosis may cause acute or chronic kidney injury, or be incidentally detected radiographically in a patient with normal renal function. Nephrocalcinosis is caused by multiple different conditions and the renal prognosis is determined by the underlying cause; whereas most patients with nephrocalcinosis do not progress to end-stage renal disease, certain underlying conditions, if not effectively treated, may be associated with progressive kidney dysfunction. The pathogenesis, clinical presentation, causes and treatment of nephrocalcinosis are discussed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION AND CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term nephrocalcinosis is used to describe the deposition of both calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrocalcinosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Some experts limit the definition of nephrocalcinosis to the deposition of calcium phosphate and refer to the deposition of calcium oxalate as oxalosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrocalcinosis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. For the purposes of this review, we retain the broader definition of nephrocalcinosis to include both calcium phosphate and calcium oxalate. The term oxalosis will refer exclusively to calcium oxalate deposition.</p><p>The defining characteristic of nephrocalcinosis is generalized calcium deposition in the kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrocalcinosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Localized calcium deposition that occurs with focal renal injury is not included in this definition.</p><p>Nephrocalcinosis is classified as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrocalcinosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Molecular or chemical &ndash; A measurable increase in intracellular calcium concentration exists but is not visible microscopically or via radiographic imaging.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Microscopic &ndash; Mineral deposits are visible by light microscopic examination of tissue obtained by biopsy but not by radiographic imaging.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Macroscopic &ndash; Calcification is visible by radiographic imaging.</p><p/><p>Molecular nephrocalcinosis is most often observed in patients with overt hypercalcemia and is completely reversed upon correction of the hypercalcemia (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hypercalcemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hypercalcemia&quot;</a>). Microscopic nephrocalcinosis is a precursor of macroscopic nephrocalcinosis but can also be associated with acute kidney injury as occurs in acute phosphate nephropathy following bowel cleansing with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-phosphate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium phosphate</a> preparations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrocalcinosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-phosphate-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute phosphate nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Nephrocalcinosis can involve the renal medulla or, much less often, the cortex. In the largest reported series of 375 patients with macroscopic nephrocalcinosis, 97 percent involved the medulla [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrocalcinosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Cortical nephrocalcinosis accounted for less than 3 percent of cases and was usually due to severe underlying cortical disease, such as renal cortical necrosis (often associated with pregnancy) or chronic glomerulonephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrocalcinosis/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. Other causes of cortical nephrocalcinosis include primary and secondary oxalosis (which can also cause medullary nephrocalcinosis) and renal allograft rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrocalcinosis/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure-in-pregnancy#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute kidney injury (acute renal failure) in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Renal cortical necrosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nephrocalcinosis is caused by an increase in the urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> oxalate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrocalcinosis/abstract/2,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9</a>]. The most common cause of nephrocalcinosis is increased urinary calcium excretion with or without hypercalcemia. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> below.)</p><p>These metabolic abnormalities are also closely associated with nephrolithiasis, and patients frequently present with both conditions. However, for reasons that are not clear, nephrocalcinosis is not always associated with nephrolithiasis, and nephrolithiasis often occurs in the absence of nephrocalcinosis. In addition, nephrocalcinosis often suggests a serious metabolic defect, whereas nephrolithiasis is commonly observed in otherwise healthy individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrocalcinosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for calcium stones in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate crystals form when the concentration of the reactants exceeds the saturation limit. In a careful histologic study of intraoperative renal biopsy specimens from idiopathic calcium oxalate stone formers, calcium phosphate (hydroxyapatite) deposits (Randall's plaques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrocalcinosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]) were primarily noted in the inner medullary (papillary) interstitium in the basement membranes of the thin limbs of the loop of Henle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrocalcinosis/abstract/9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11</a>] where tubular fluid is saturated even under normal circumstances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrocalcinosis/abstract/4,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9</a>].</p><p>These calcium phosphate plaques can enlarge into the surrounding interstitial tissue, or rupture into the tubule lumen serving as a nidus for luminal calcium oxalate stone formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrocalcinosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In vitro studies have shown that calcium phosphate can promote calcium oxalate crystallization. Randall's plaques are also seen in patients with calcium phosphate stones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrocalcinosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>In the intraoperative biopsy study cited above, the histologic findings were different in patients who had undergone intestinal bypass (bariatric) surgery for obesity and subsequently developed calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrocalcinosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Crystal deposition was not present in the papillary interstitium as in idiopathic calcium oxalate stone formers. However crystals were attached to the apical surface of collecting tubule cells or completely filled the tubular lumen, appearing to obstruct a number of inner medullary collecting ducts.</p><p>A later series from the same group described the endoscopic findings in the renal papillae in 23 stone formers undergoing percutaneous nephrolithotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrocalcinosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. All kidneys had papillary plaque, which was found in over 90 percent of papillae. Eleven patients had attached stones, which appeared to occur on Randall's plaques.</p><p>Oxalate crystals are either homogeneous (composed exclusively of calcium and oxalate) or heterogeneous (composed of calcium, oxalate and phosphate). In general, homogeneous calcium oxalate crystals form only in the setting of marked hyperoxaluria, such as that which occurs in primary hyperoxaluria or ethylene glycol toxicity. Heterogeneous crystals form in the setting of milder degrees of hyperoxaluria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrocalcinosis/abstract/2,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-hyperoxaluria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary hyperoxaluria&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methanol-and-ethylene-glycol-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary histologic finding on renal biopsy in patients with nephrocalcinosis is tubular, intracellular and interstitial basophilic calcifications. Calcium phosphate deposits are distinguished from calcium oxalate by positive staining with the von Kossa stain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F55578\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55578 \">picture 1</a>) and by the absence of birefringence under polarized light.

Distal RTA results in a systemic acidosis that requires increased buffering of acid by bone, with the subsequent release of bone calcium and phosphate. Metabolic acidosis is also associated with hypocitraturia, which can promote calcium precipitation in the tubules.

These disorders are discussed in detail elsewhere. Treatment of at least the first two consists of oral phosphate supplements, which increase phosphate excretion, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitriol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitriol</a>, which increases calcium excretion, both of which can contribute to the development of nephrocalcinosis.

Primary hyperoxaluria (PHO) is an autosomal recessive disorder that is characterized by the increased synthesis of oxalate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrocalcinosis/abstract/7,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,35</a>]. In a series of 95 children with PHO reported to an international registry, 90 percent had nephrolithiasis at diagnosis and 48 percent had nephrocalcinosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrocalcinosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-hyperoxaluria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary hyperoxaluria&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hyperoxaluria may also be secondary to the increased enteric absorption of oxalate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrocalcinosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Fat malabsorption is the most common cause of increased oxalate absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrocalcinosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The mechanism by which fat malabsorption increases oxalate absorption is via the binding of calcium by free fatty acids in the colon. This decreases the amount of calcium that is available to bind to oxalate and form insoluble calcium oxalate and results in increased oxalate absorption since free oxalate is more easily absorbed compared to calcium-bound oxalate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrocalcinosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Fat malabsorption leading to hyperoxaluria and nephrocalcinosis can be seen in a variety of clinical settings, including pancreatic insufficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, bowel resection or jejunoileal or gastric bypass, use of the weight reduction drug <a href=\"topic.htm?path=orlistat-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">orlistat</a>, which causes fat malabsorption by inhibiting gastric and pancreatic lipases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrocalcinosis/abstract/37-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-40</a>], and cystic fibrosis, which causes pancreatic insufficiency and in which other factors promoting calcium deposition (such as hypercalciuria) may also be present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F54743\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54743 \">table 1</a>).

In addition to being part of the evaluation for chronic kidney disease, imaging may detect nephrocalcinosis as an incidental finding when performed for indications unrelated to the kidneys or as part of an evaluation for nephrolithiasis.

One study, for example, evaluated 62 patients seen at a stone clinic in which an imaging test suggested either nephrocalcinosis or nephrolithiasis (pelvicalyceal calcifications) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrocalcinosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. All patients underwent abdominal plain film, US, and CT. Nephrocalcinosis was considered present if at least two radiologists made the diagnosis on US <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> CT.
