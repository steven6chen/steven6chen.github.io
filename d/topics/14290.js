Priapism is defined as a persistent erection of the penis or clitoris that is not associated with sexual stimulation or desire. The focus of this topic will be penile priapism. Studies differ on the length of time of erection used to define priapism, but most describe priapism as an erection lasting at least four hours. Priapism has been found to adversely affect quality of life, sexual function, and physical wellness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Priapism is relatively rare but can occur in all age groups and is particularly common in patients with sickle cell disease. It is generally classified as ischemic or nonischemic. Ischemic priapism is a urologic emergency, whereas nonischemic priapism is usually self-limited.</p><p>The epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of priapism will be discussed here. Issues related to priapism in sickle cell disease are addressed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Priapism and erectile dysfunction in sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a study of emergency department visits between 2006 and 2009 in the United States, there were 32,462 visits for priapism, which corresponded to an incidence of 0.73 per 100,000 men per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Clitoral priapism occurs less commonly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Priapism can be seen in any age group. However, there is a bimodal peak distribution of incidence, occurring between 5 and 10 years in children and 20 to 50 years in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Penile erection begins with the relaxation of the smooth muscle of cavernosal arteries and tissue, leading to increased nonischemic inflow and decreased venous outflow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F66964\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66964 \">figure 1</a>). As intracorporal pressure rises to mean arterial pressure, the inflow of blood ceases. Priapism generally involves the corpora cavernosa only, although occasionally affects the corpus spongiosum and the glans penis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The underlying cause is not identified in most cases (primary or idiopathic priapism), but, in others, certain medications and disease states have been implicated (secondary priapism) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F54354\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54354 \">table 1</a>). The most common cause in adults is medication use, especially with intracavernosal injections, accounting for 25 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The most commonly associated condition in children is sickle cell disease.</p><p>There are two main types of priapism: ischemic and nonischemic. Ischemic priapism is much more common in sickle cell disease than nonischemic priapism, which is only seen in this setting with prior trauma or instrumentation of the penis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Ischemic priapism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ischemic priapism (also known as low-flow, anoxic, or veno-occlusive priapism) is the more common form.</p><p>Ischemic priapism is prolonged erection with failure of detumescence related to impaired relaxation and paralysis of cavernosal smooth muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. This results in a compartment syndrome, with increasing hypoxia and acidosis in the cavernous tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Nitric oxide has been proposed as an important mediator in the development of priapism. Nitric oxide serves a fundamental role in the erectile response by mediating relaxation of smooth muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Understanding of the nitric oxide pathway led to the development and use of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. PDE5 inhibitors inhibit breakdown of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and potentiate nitric oxide-mediated penile smooth muscle relaxation for erectile function. A regulatory defect in the nitric oxide pathway has been proposed to account for some patients with priapism, particularly those with sickle cell disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Priapism and erectile dysfunction in sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology and classification'</a>.)</p><p>Prolonged erection in ischemic priapism leads to structural damage of erectile tissue, related in part to tissue edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Tissue damage is believed to occur at the microscopic level as early as four to six hours after onset of erection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism/abstract/11,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,16</a>]. Significant structural changes in the cavernous smooth muscle can be seen after 12 hours&rsquo; duration of priapism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Irreversible damage can be identified after 24 to 48 hours of priapism, including necrosis of cavernosal smooth muscle and endothelial cells, fibroblast proliferation, and ultimately fibrosis of corpus cavernosa.</p><p>The duration of priapism is strongly associated with incidence of subsequent erectile dysfunction. Ninety percent of men with an ischemic priapism lasting 24 hours do not regain the ability to have sexual intercourse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Early relief of priapism with return of normal flaccidity is not likely to be associated with long-term sequelae.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Recurrent priapism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recurrent priapism (also known as &ldquo;stuttering priapism&rdquo;) is an uncommon condition usually occurring in men with sickle cell disease. Recurrent priapism is a form of ischemic priapism, which starts off with erections of short duration. The onset is usually during sleep with persistence upon waking. These episodes become longer in duration and more frequent, eventually leading to a full-blown ischemic priapism event. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Priapism and erectile dysfunction in sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The pathophysiology of this type of priapism is not fully understood. A mechanism based on dysregulation of nitric oxide and PDE5 in the corporal smooth muscle has been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism/abstract/13,18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,18-21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonischemic priapism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonischemic priapism (also known as high-flow, arterial, or congenital priapism) occurs less commonly than ischemic priapism and is usually the result of a fistula between the cavernosal artery and corpus cavernosum.</p><p>Nonischemic priapism is commonly related to penile or perineal trauma, often from needle injury of the cavernosal artery. Blunt trauma, which can occur from bicycling, may also damage the cavernosal artery, leading to increased flow through the corpora cavernosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The onset of post-traumatic, nonischemic priapism can occur up to 72 hours after injury.</p><p>Congenital arterial malformations may also cause of nonischemic priapism.</p><p>Nonischemic priapism does not represent an emergency situation, as the cavernous blood is well-oxygenated. Nonischemic priapism will resolve spontaneously in up to 62 percent of untreated cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">History and physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following information should be obtained on history from a patient with suspected priapism:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duration of erection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior episodes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medications</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of recreational drugs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of hematologic disease, especially sickle cell disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Penile or perineal trauma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence and severity of pain</p><p/><p>In ischemic priapism, the patient typically presents with a painful and rigid erection. A history of sickle cell disease or other hematologic abnormality also suggests an ischemic etiology. In rare cases, ischemic priapism can present with penile gangrene, usually resulting in necrosis of the entire penis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Nonischemic priapism is associated with a history of trauma (often related to needle injection or urologic procedures) and an erection that is less painful and usually less than fully rigid.</p><p>The genitalia, perineum, and abdomen should be carefully examined for penile rigidity and signs of trauma or malignancy. With priapism, penile examination reveals engorged corpora cavernosa, but, in contrast to normal erections, the corpus spongiosum and glans penis can remain flaccid.</p><p>Determining whether priapism is ischemic or nonischemic may be possible on the basis of history and physical examination alone, but additional studies are helpful in most patients. Cavernosal blood gas analysis is the most useful means for distinguishing the type of priapism and should be performed when the type of priapism is uncertain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Cavernosal blood gas analysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood can be aspirated from the corpora cavernosum for a blood gas analysis to differentiate between ischemic and nonischemic priapism. A small caliber needle can be used (ie, 19 to 21 gauge) for easier control and to minimize trauma. Blood is aspirated from one side of the corpus cavernosum, and 3 to 5 mL is typically withdrawn.</p><p>The color of the aspirated blood sample is black in patients with ischemic priapism. Corporal blood gas analysis will show hypoxemia, hypercarbia, and acidemia. By contrast, the color of aspirated blood is red in patients with nonischemic priapism. Blood gas analysis will show normal levels of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and pH (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F51913\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51913 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Other blood studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Appropriate blood tests should be performed if there is clinical concern for a hemoglobinopathy or other blood dyscrasia. A complete blood count may reveal anemia, leukemia, or platelet abnormalities. Reticulocyte count and hemoglobin analysis are indicated when sickle cell disease, thalassemia major, or leukemia is suspected. In sickle cell disease, the peripheral blood smear may identify sickled red cells or Howell-Jolly bodies, reflecting hyposplenia.

Usual doses of several classes of psychoactive drugs including antidepressants may cause priapism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Doppler ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doppler ultrasonography may be performed as an alternative to cavernosal blood gas to differentiate between ischemic and nonischemic types of priapism. Minimal or absent blood flow with Doppler ultrasonography is observed in the cavernosal arteries in ischemic priapism, whereas normal to high blood flow is observed in nonischemic priapism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Doppler ultrasound can also detect cavernous arterial fistula, pseudoaneurysm, or other anatomic abnormalities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1709832385\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of priapism is made on the basis of visual inspection of the penis, which reveals an erection that has been present for more than two to four hours in the absence of sexual excitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Duration of erection may be shorter for patients with recurrent priapism. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent priapism'</a> above.)</p><p>The type of priapism, ischemic versus nonischemic, may be suspected on the basis of history and physical examination and can be confirmed by cavernous blood gas analysis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> Doppler ultrasonography. Determining the type is particularly important since delayed diagnosis of ischemic priapism can lead to irreversible damage of the penile tissue and erectile dysfunction.

Urology consultation is recommended. The safety and efficacy of different treatments for are not well established. Most evidence is derived from case reports or case series, as there are no randomized controlled trials and a paucity of evidence-based guidelines.

After four hours&rsquo; duration, aspiration, with or without irrigation, combined with an intracavernosal injection of a sympathomimetic drug is considered to be the optimal treatment.</p><p>Sympathomimetics induce contraction of the cavernous smooth muscle and thus permit venous outflow. In one review, resolution of priapism was reported in 24 to 36 percent in studies treating patients with aspiration alone with or without irrigation and in 43 to 81 percent in studies treating with intracavernosal sympathomimetic medication with or without irrigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The risk of post-priapism erectile dysfunction was also lower with sympathomimetic use. In another study, 86 percent of patients had successful detumescence with the use of intracavernous high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenylephrine</a> in the treatment of ischemic priapism over a five-year period at a single institution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Phenylephrine</a>, a pure alpha-adrenergic agonist, is considered the sympathomimetic of choice for ischemic priapism by the AUA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Phenylephrine has minimal risk of cardiovascular side effects compared with other sympathomimetic medications such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>, norepinephrine, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ephedrine-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ephedrine</a>. Although trial data are lacking, several small observational studies demonstrate prompt resolution of priapism with phenylephrine intracavernosal injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism/abstract/27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-30</a>].</p><p>The toxicity of sympathomimetics include alpha adrenergic-mediated hypertensive effects and beta adrenergic-mediated inotropic and chronotropic effects. Side effects include acute hypertension, headache, and cardiac arrhythmia. Blood pressure monitoring is advised for all patients, and cardiac monitoring is recommended for patients with a history of cardiovascular disease.</p><p>Using a non-heparinized 19 gauge butterfly needle, approximately 5 mL of blood should be aspirated to decompress the corpora. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Phenylephrine</a> should then be injected into one side of the corpus cavernosum. In adults, phenylephrine should be diluted with normal saline to provide a final concentration of approximately 100 to 500 mcg per mL. One mL intracavernous injections of the freshly diluted phenylephrine solution are administered every three to five minutes until resolution or up&nbsp;until one hour before deciding whether the treatment will be successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Lower concentrations and smaller volumes&nbsp;are appropriate for use in children and those with severe cardiovascular disease.

A surgical fistula is created between the corpus cavernosum and the corpus spongiosum, glans penis, or one of the penile veins. Several observational studies have shown some efficacy in relieving ischemic priapism, with limited preservation of erectile function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism/abstract/31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-34</a>]. Some patients requiring multiple surgical procedures. Implantation of a penile prosthesis at the time of fistula surgery has been suggested for patients with late presentation (&ge;72 hours) because the prognosis for sexual function is poor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Recurrent priapism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Episodes of recurrent priapism should be treated as ischemic priapism events.

Aspiration and injectable sympathomimetic agents have not been shown to be effective. Sympathomimetic agents can also lead to cardiovascular side effects without notable benefit.</p><p>Nonischemic priapism can be managed on an outpatient basis. The risk of short-term complications in patients with nonischemic priapism appears to be small, and follow-up with a urologist within approximately one week is appropriate.</p><p>If the patient prefers an intervention rather than observation, arteriography with embolization of the fistula may be indicated. Embolization can be done using absorbable gelatin powder, metallic coils, or autologous clot. Several observational studies have shown prompt relief of nonischemic priapism with preservation of erectile function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/priapism/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>].
