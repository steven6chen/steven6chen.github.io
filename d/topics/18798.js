This can cause the heart to beat abnormally. The damage can also lead to problems with the heart walls or valves (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F56936\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56936 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Whether or not problems happen after a heart attack and how serious they are depends on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How serious the heart attack was, how much of the heart was damaged, and which part of the heart was damaged</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How quickly the heart attack was treated</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25937966\"><span class=\"h1\">What problems can happen after a heart attack?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different problems can happen in the days to weeks after a heart attack. Some problems are not too serious and can be treated, but others can cause death.</p><p>The most common problems that can happen after a heart attack are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Abnormal heart rhythms</strong> &ndash; Each person has a built-in electrical system in the heart that controls his or her heartbeat. After a heart attack, the electrical signals that control the heartbeat can become abnormal and cause an abnormal heart rhythm. Abnormal heart rhythms are also called &quot;arrhythmias.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An abnormal heart rhythm can cause people to feel like their heart is racing, skipping beats, or beating out of sync. An abnormal heart rhythm can also cause dizziness, fainting, or even death.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Treatment depends on the type of abnormal rhythm and the person's symptoms and can include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&quot;Watching and waiting&quot; &ndash; If your abnormal heart rhythm isn't too serious, the doctor might watch it to see if it goes away on its own.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Different types of medicines</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A procedure called &quot;cardioversion,&quot; which involves applying a mild electrical current to the heart to fix its rhythm</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Catheter ablation &ndash; Ablation procedures use heat (&quot;radiofrequency ablation&quot;) or cold (&quot;cryoablation&quot;) to destroy the small part of the heart that is sending abnormal electrical signals. After this, the heart can beat normally again.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A device called an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (&quot;ICD&quot;) &ndash; The device goes under a person's skin near his or her heart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F67053\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67053 \">figure 2</a>) and can sense and treat certain abnormal heartbeats.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Heart failure</strong> &ndash; Heart failure is a condition in which the heart does not pump as well as it should. This can cause symptoms such as swelling (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F61706\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61706 \">figure 3</a>), trouble breathing, and feeling tired. Sometimes, heart failure after a heart attack lasts only for a short time. Other times, heart failure after a heart attack becomes a long-term problem.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Doctors can treat heart failure with different types of medicines. The medicines can improve symptoms and help people feel better. Some medicines help people live longer. Most people need to take more than one medicine every day. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: Medicines for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (The Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inflammation of the lining around the heart</strong> &ndash; When the lining around the heart gets inflamed or irritated, doctors call it &quot;pericarditis.&quot; Pericarditis can cause chest pain that gets worse when you cough or take a deep breath. Sometimes, it also causes a fever.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If you have pericarditis, your doctor will probably first treat it by increasing your daily dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a>. (After a heart attack, most people take aspirin every day.) He or she might also prescribe another NSAID. NSAIDs are a large group of medicines that includes aspirin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">indomethacin</a> (sample brand names: Indocin, Indocid), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand names: Aleve, Naprosyn).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If the inflammation causes fluid to collect around your heart, your doctor might drain the fluid.</p><p/><p>Other problems can happen after a heart attack, but they are much less common. These problems usually happen within the first few days after a heart attack and can be life-threatening. They include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tears in the heart muscle or heart walls</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems with the heart valves</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood clots in the lung</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Strokes</p><p/><p>These problems usually cause sudden and severe symptoms, such as sudden trouble breathing or passing out. They need emergency treatment, which might include medicines, surgery, or other procedures. But these problems can't always be treated and sometimes lead to death.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25937973\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-attack-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart attack (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-attack-recovery-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart attack recovery (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-after-a-heart-attack-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines after a heart attack (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart failure (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitral-regurgitation-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Mitral regurgitation (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-vein-thrombosis-blood-clots-in-the-legs-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Deep vein thrombosis (blood clots in the legs) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ventricular-fibrillation-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Ventricular fibrillation (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=catheter-ablation-for-the-heart-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Catheter ablation for the heart (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-attack-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Heart attack (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Heart failure (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitral-regurgitation-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Mitral regurgitation (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
