Information on diet, insulin therapy, and glucose monitoring should be provided by clinicians with experience in management of diabetes during pregnancy. A team approach is efficient and is usually required to provide the necessary expertise. In addition to the obstetrical providers (physician, nurse, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> midwife), the team may include an endocrinologist, endocrinology nurse, nutritionist, and the patient's primary care provider.

These extra visits can be used to review monitored blood glucose values and results from the ophthalmologic and laboratory examination (eg, renal function, glycated hemoglobin, thyroid function).

Whether obesity adds to the risks associated with diabetes in pregnancy is an area of ongoing investigation. A 2013 study of New York City maternal mortality data from 1995 to 2003 found that maternal obesity and pregestational diabetes were each associated with an increased risk of death during a delivery hospitalization (adjusted OR 2.9 and 3.3, respectively), but how concurrence of these two conditions influenced mortality risk was not reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A second study using New York City birth data argued that diabetes and obesity were independent risk factors for the outcomes of cesarean and preterm delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], in agreement with other studies that showed obesity adds to the risk of pregnancy-associated maternal and neonatal morbidity in diabetic women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].

The lower prevalence in 2004 likely reflect trends in better periconceptional glucose control, as well as increased periconceptional folate exposure.</p><p>Either ultrasound alone or in combination with measurement of MSAFP may be used to screen for neural tube defects. We use ultrasound alone. Since the median MSAFP level is 15 percent lower and the prevalence of NTDs is higher in women with diabetes than in those without diabetes, a lower threshold MSAFP value (eg, approximately 1.5 MoM [multiples of the median]) has typically been used in women with diabetes to obtain the same negative predictive value for NTDs as in women without diabetes. Laboratory requisitions for MSAFP typically ask providers to indicate if the patient has diabetes; however, the need for correction for diabetes independent of maternal weight has been challenged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

If those performing the ultrasound are aware of the diagnosis of diabetes, they can be particularly mindful of evaluating for anomalies common to such pregnancies. Early detection of congenital anomalies allows parents and clinicians to prepare for the birth of neonate who may require specialized care. Alternatively, some parents may choose pregnancy termination; such procedures are more easily and safely undertaken at earlier gestational ages.</p><p>The second trimester ultrasound examination should encompass a detailed survey of fetal anatomy. As noted above, fetuses of women with diabetes are at risk for neural tube defects and evidence of such anomalies is often apparent on ultrasound (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasound diagnosis of neural tube defects&quot;</a>). The second trimester ultrasound in pregnancies complicated by diabetes should also focus on cardiac anatomy, including a four-chamber view of the heart and visualization of the outflow tracts. Detailed examination of the fetal heart is important because congenital heart disease occurs more frequently in the offspring of women with diabetes than in the general population and accounts for about one-half of diabetes-related major congenital anomalies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/26,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,35</a>]. As an example, in a series of 535 pregnant women with preexisting diabetes, 30 (5.6 percent) delivered an infant with confirmed congenital heart disease; the risk was 8.3 percent in women with A1C &ge;8.5 percent versus 3.9 percent of those with an A1C below this level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Some centers refer all women with diabetes for fetal echocardiograms, while others restrict fetal echocardiography to fetuses with an abnormal detailed anatomic survey or women with marked glucose abnormalities. A selective approach is acceptable given routine echocardiography has a low yield in centers with high volume, skilled comprehensive ultrasound services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Conotruncal and ventricular septal defects are the most common cardiac defects found in these fetuses.

In contrast, during the third trimester, insulin resistance due to the hormones produced by the placenta increases rapidly, and changes in insulin dose are commonly required to maintain euglycemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment of fetal well-being</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intrauterine fetal demise is now a rare complication of diabetic pregnancy, primarily due to achievement of good glycemic control. The fetus of the diabetic mother is at risk for hypoxia primarily from two mechanisms: (1) fetal hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia increase fetal oxygen consumption, which may induce fetal hypoxemia and acidosis if the oxygen needs of the fetus are not met [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/42-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-46</a>], and (2) maternal vasculopathy and hyperglycemia can lead to reduced uteroplacental perfusion, which may be associated with reduced fetal growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends antepartum fetal testing for pregnancies complicated by pregestational diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. There are no data from large or randomized trials on which to make an evidenced-based recommendation as to which pregnancies complicated by diabetes should undergo fetal surveillance, when to start, what test to order, or how often to perform it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. As a result, management is largely based upon clinical experience and expert opinion. ACOG has suggested antepartum monitoring using fetal movement counting, biophysical profile, nonstress test (NST), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> contraction stress test at &quot;appropriate intervals,&quot; with initiation of testing generally at 32 to 34 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. At least one study, however, has questioned the reassurance provided by a normal amniotic fluid volume in diabetic pregnancies, finding that the NST, but not the amniotic fluid index, was predictive of a nonreassuring fetal heart rate tracing in labor requiring cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. A 2009 NIH workshop recognized the limitations of available data and concluded that, in managing diabetic pregnancies, it was &ldquo;not clear which method [of antenatal testing], if any, is superior&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>We begin antepartum surveillance around 32 weeks of gestation, increasing the frequency of testing to two times per week from 36 weeks until delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. In complicated patients with intrauterine growth restriction, oligohydramnios, preeclampsia, or poorly controlled blood glucose concentrations, testing may start as early as 26 weeks of gestation and is performed more frequently. Any significant deterioration in maternal status necessitates reevaluation of the fetus. The frequency of intrauterine fetal death (excluding congenital malformations) with such protocols is approximately 3 per 1000 pregnancies in women with type 1 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>If non-reassuring fetal testing is related to a potentially reversible problem such as hyperglycemia or ketoacidosis, it is advisable to resuscitate the fetus in utero by treating the medical disorder. Pathologic fetal heart rate patterns will often revert to normal when the mother's metabolic status is corrected.</p><p>If non-reassuring fetal testing appears to be related to a non-reversible problem, the gestational age and the associated risk for sequelae of prematurity strongly influence management. In premature fetuses, we try to delay delivery, at least long enough to treat the mother with glucocorticoids to accelerate fetal lung maturation (see <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Antenatal glucocorticoids'</a> below). This can be done while monitoring the fetus more intensively, or even continuously. The degree of compromise indicated by fetal surveillance is used to weigh the relative risks and benefits of delaying delivery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12667834\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment of fetal growth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation of fetal growth is a particularly important component of third trimester obstetrical care, as pregnancies complicated by maternal diabetes are commonly associated with accelerated growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>], but are also at increased risk of impaired fetal growth. We obtain an ultrasound examination at 28 to 32 weeks of gestation to assess fetal growth. We repeat the examination at three- to four-week intervals if the examination or maternal conditions raise continued concern of insufficient fetal growth. We typically perform the last sonogram at approximately 38 weeks of gestation to estimate fetal weight and assist with delivery plans. Alternatively, some obstetricians only obtain an early third trimester evaluation of fetal growth in those diabetic patients with hypertension or nephropathy and wait until 38 weeks of gestation for evaluation of others.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12668021\"><span class=\"h3\">Accelerated fetal growth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Accelerated growth is most common among women whose diabetes is marked by insulin resistance; high insulin requirements are associated with accelerated fetal growth even in euglycemic pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. </p><p>The term &quot;large for gestational age&quot; (LGA) usually refers to a fetus or newborn that is greater than the 90th centile for fetuses or infants of that gestational age (possibly including adjustments for fetal gender and ethnicity).

The term &quot;macrosomia&quot; refers to a fetus or infant that is greater than some defined weight regardless of gestational age, gender, or ethnicity. Various authors and professional organizations have defined macrosomia as greater than 4000, greater than 4250, and greater than 4500 grams. The American College of Obstetricians suggests a threshold of 4500 grams because maternal and infant morbidity increases sharply above this level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].&nbsp;</p><p>Maternal diabetes mellitus may double the incidence of LGA infants; it also changes the anthropometric measurements of infants of diabetic mothers (IDMs) compared with offspring of women without diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Specifically, the chest-to-head and shoulder-to-head ratios are increased in IDMs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. </p><p>LGA fetuses are at increased risk for a prolonged second stage of labor, shoulder dystocia, operative delivery, maternal and infant birth trauma, and perinatal death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

A possible explanation for this observation is that insulin is the major regulatory hormone of fetal growth and fetal insulin receptors are maximally expressed at 19 to 25 weeks of gestation. In spite of this physiology, ultrasound examination at 29 to 34 weeks is not highly predictive of later LGA births in these pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>Although neonatal weight is an important predictor of neonatal morbidity and estimation of fetal weight at term is an important variable in delivery planning, there is no highly reliable method for identifying LGA fetuses before delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/35,67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,67,68</a>].

LGA is most apparent in the liver and abdomen and occurs in approximately 88 percent of fetuses in whom the abdominal circumference and estimated fetal weight both exceed the 90th percentile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Enlarged biparietal diameter and head circumference are less predictive of LGA than enlarged abdominal measurements. Fetal fat thickness or body habitus and a variety of equations (eg, chest minus biparietal diameter &ge;1.4 cm) have also been used to predict LGA and risk of shoulder dystocia.

The endocrine changes associated with maternal diabetes delay fetal lung maturation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. Specifically, high fetal insulin levels enhance cellular hypertrophy and hyperplasia at the expense of cellular maturation, thus leading to macrosomia and immature lung function. In the era prior to the availability of fetal pulmonary maturity tests, respiratory distress syndrome accounted for 52 percent of neonatal deaths among infants born to women with pregestational diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>].</p><p>We evaluate timing of delivery based on clinical circumstances and maternal and fetal condition, mindful of the risk of pulmonary morbidity among preterm and early term newborns of women with diabetes, but do not use fetal pulmonary tests on amniotic fluid to help make these decisions.

Preterm delivery should be avoided, except when glycemic control is suboptimal or there are other maternal or fetal reasons for concern (eg, maternal vascular disease). In these cases, an acceptable approach is to induce labor at 37 weeks (or earlier) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/96,97\" class=\"abstract_t\">96,97</a>].

If these criteria for continued pregnancy are not met or the patient is not compliant, induction is warranted before the cervix is favorable. Cervical ripening agents should be employed and are safe. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-of-labor-with-oxytocin\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction of labor with oxytocin&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A 2011 NIH workshop, &ldquo;Timing of Indicated Late Preterm and Early Term Births,&rdquo; echoed these recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. For women with pregestational diabetes without vascular disease whose diabetes was well controlled, the workshop experts recommended delivery at &ge;39 weeks. For those with pregestational diabetes and vascular disease, they suggested that delivery at 37 to 39 weeks was appropriate, and that delivery as early as 34 weeks could be considered on an individualized basis among patients with poor glycemic control. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has published similar recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>].</p><p>Preterm delivery is also performed for the usual obstetrical indications (eg, preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, abruption, premature labor with or without premature rupture of membranes, non-reassuring fetal testing) or for worsening maternal renal insufficiency or active proliferative retinopathy.

In past eras, elective early delivery of women with pregestational diabetes had been advocated to prevent fetal death in late gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/100-102\" class=\"abstract_t\">100-102</a>]. This was a reasonable approach prior to 1950 since one-half of stillbirths in this population occurred after the 38th week of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. However, fetal mortality has fallen precipitously among both diabetic women and the general obstetric population over the past few decades; thus, for most patients, the morbidity and mortality from prematurity and failed induction should be weighed carefully against contemporary estimates of potential benefit from early delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. Currently, it is unclear whether women with good glycemic control and reassuring antepartum surveillance are at any increased risk of an intrauterine demise at term. Although there are case reports of fetal deaths occurring within hours of reassuring fetal testing in gravidas with diabetes (and in nondiabetic women, as well), despite maternal euglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>], there are insufficient data from large well-designed studies to convincingly demonstrate that the risk of fetal demise with modern, intensive perinatal care is increased compared to controls without diabetes.</p><p>The only randomized trial evaluating the timing of delivery of 200 women with uncomplicated insulin-requiring diabetes (13 pregestational, 187 gestational) and appropriately grown fetuses showed induction during the 38th week was advantageous compared to expectant management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>]. Women randomly assigned to active induction of labor within five days of reaching 38 weeks of gestation had a lower prevalence of macrosomia compared to those managed expectantly with biweekly nonstress tests and amniotic fluid volume assessment until 42 weeks (10 versus 23 percent) and fewer cases of shoulder dystocia (0 versus 3 percent). The rate of cesarean delivery was similar for the two groups. Moreover, 50 percent of women in the expectant management group ultimately required induction for obstetric indications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12669378\"><span class=\"h3\">Is early induction recommended when macrosomia is suspected?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Due to the difficulty in accurately diagnosing macrosomia, and the relatively small probability of permanent neurologic injury resulting from shoulder dystocia, induction of labor for women with suspected macrosomic infants has not decreased the risk of maternal or neonatal morbidity in women without diabetes or mixed populations of women with and without diabetes.

Severe hyperglycemia can cause an osmotic diuresis resulting in maternal volume depletion. This, in turn, can result in reduced uterine perfusion and, in association with the metabolic abnormalities of DKA, produce life-threatening fetal hypoxemia and acidosis. Maternal mortality is less than 1 percent, but fetal mortality rates of 9 to 36 percent have been reported, as well as increased risks of preterm birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>].

This includes the use of intravenous insulin, appropriate volume replacement, correction of electrolyte abnormalities (including potassium, phosphate, and magnesium), monitoring acidosis, and a search for precipitating causes, such as infection or insulin noncompliance. Glucocorticoids and beta-mimetics should be avoided during DKA, as they will worsen hyperglycemia.

Emergent delivery before maternal stabilization should be avoided because it increases the risk of maternal morbidity and mortality, and may result in delivery of a hypoxic, acidotic preterm infant for whom in utero resuscitation may have resulted in a better outcome. The timing of delivery needs to be individualized based on multiple factors including gestational age, maternal condition (whether the mother is responding to aggressive therapy or deteriorating), and fetal condition (whether the fetal heart rate pattern is improving or deteriorating). Fetal heart rate abnormalities resulting from maternal acidosis will often improve as DKA is treated and maternal condition improves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1755783417\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'First prenatal visit'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to routine prenatal testing, assessment of the diabetic gravida should include: glycated hemoglobin concentration, baseline renal function, thyrotropin and free thyroxine, electrocardiogram, dilated and comprehensive eye examination by an ophthalmologist, and first trimester ultrasound examination if pregnancy dating is uncertain. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Laboratory monitoring across the remainder of pregnancy is described in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F51463\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51463 \">table 6</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The care of women with diabetes during pregnancy generally requires a team approach to provide the necessary expertise. Information on diet, insulin therapy, exercise and glucose monitoring should be provided by clinicians with experience in management of diabetes during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Counseling and management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A markedly elevated glycohemoglobin value in the first trimester is associated with increased risks of both first trimester miscarriage and congenital malformations. We typically advise patients of these risks and evaluate fetal development via second trimester sonographic examination and maternal serum multiple marker screening. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Risk of congenital anomalies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screening for Down syndrome and neural tube defects (NTDs) are offered, according to routine obstetrical practice. Diabetes does not increase the risk of fetal aneuploidy, but does affect interpretation of the analyte panels. The risk of NTDs is increased for fetuses of diabetic gravidae. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Screening for aneuploidy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12667492\" class=\"local\">'Screening for neural tube defects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest ultrasound examination and fetal echocardiogram at approximately 18 weeks of gestation to evaluate for congenital anomalies, particularly congenital heart disease. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Screening for other congenital anomalies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We begin antepartum surveillance with weekly nonstress tests at 32 weeks of gestation, increasing the frequency of testing to two times per week from 36 weeks until delivery. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of fetal well-being'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We obtain an ultrasound examination at approximately 38 weeks of gestation to estimate fetal weight and assist with delivery plans. (See <a href=\"#H12667834\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of fetal growth'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nifedipine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a> for tocolysis of preterm labor instead of a beta-adrenergic receptor agonist (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Preterm labor'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If antenatal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">betamethasone</a> is administered to accelerate fetal lung maturation between 23 and 34 weeks of gestation, we monitor capillary blood glucose concentrations hourly beginning 12 hours after the initial dose and continuing for at least 24 hours after the second dose, and then several times per day thereafter. We administer insulin intravenously as needed to maintain euglycemia. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Antenatal glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the expected fetal weight is over 4500 grams, we suggest cesarean delivery to avoid possible trauma from shoulder dystocia (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Route of delivery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest induction of labor at 39 to 40 weeks of gestation in women with favorable cervices and fetuses less than 4500 g (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). The presence of high risk factors, such as poor glucose control, worsening nephropathy or retinopathy, preeclampsia, or restricted fetal growth warrant consideration of earlier delivery. Awaiting the spontaneous onset of labor is reasonable if there is good glycemic control and no pregnancy or additional maternal complications. However, extending pregnancy beyond 40 weeks of gestation is generally not advised unless the patient has gestational diabetes with excellent glucose control with dietary modification alone. If induction of an unfavorable cervix is planned, use of cervical ripening agents is safe and effective. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Timing of delivery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest avoiding induction because of suspected fetal macrosomia (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This intervention has not been proven to improve maternal or fetal outcomes, and may increase the cesarean delivery rate. (See <a href=\"#H12669378\" class=\"local\">'Is early induction recommended when macrosomia is suspected?'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Pregestational Diabetes Mellitus.
