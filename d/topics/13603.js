More than 300 germline <em>VHL</em> mutations have been identified that lead to loss of function of the VHL protein.</p><p>Patients with VHL syndrome may be divided into two groups: type I and type II. Patients from kindreds with type I syndrome do not develop pheochromocytoma, whereas patients with kindreds with type II syndrome are at high risk for developing pheochromocytoma. In addition, kindreds with type II VHL syndrome are subdivided into type IIA (low risk for renal cell carcinoma), type IIB (high risk for renal cell carcinoma), and type IIC (pheochromocytomas only). Genotype-phenotype correlations have been documented for this disorder, and specific mutations are associated with particular patterns of tumor formation. In up to 98 percent of cases, pheochromocytoma is associated with missense mutations (rather than truncating or null mutations) in the <em>VHL</em> gene. Certain missense mutations appear to be associated with the type IIC presentation of VHL (pheochromocytomas only).

Eighty-five percent of individuals with MEN2A have a mutation in codon 634, particularly p.Cys634Arg. Aganglionic megacolon (Hirschsprung disease) may occur in families with MEN2A who have a &quot;Janus&quot; mutation (a mutation that acts simultaneously as both a gain-in-function and a loss-of-function mutation) in the <em>RET</em> proto-oncogene (exon 10: codons 609, 611, 618, 620).

A single methionine to threonine missense mutation in exon 16 (p.Met918Thr) is responsible for more than 95 percent of MEN2B cases. Another mutation, alanine to phenylalanine at codon 883 in exon 15, has been found in 4 percent of MEN2B kindreds.

However, some patients (approximately 40 percent) have the disease as part of a familial disorder; in these patients, the catecholamine-secreting tumors are more likely to be bilateral adrenal pheochromocytomas or paragangliomas.</p><p>There are several familial disorders associated with pheochromocytoma, all of which have autosomal dominant inheritance:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome, associated with mutations in the <em>VHL</em> tumor suppressor gene. (See <a href=\"#H108071222\" class=\"local\">'VHL syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2), which is associated with mutations in the <em>RET</em>-proto-oncogene. (See <a href=\"#H108070739\" class=\"local\">'MEN2'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pheochromocytoma is also seen, albeit infrequently, with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), due to mutations in the <em>NF1</em> gene. (See <a href=\"#H108070768\" class=\"local\">'Neurofibromatosis type 1'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The approximate frequency of pheochromocytoma in these disorders is 10 to 20 percent in VHL syndrome, 50 percent in MEN2, and 3 percent with NF1.</p><p/><p>Most cases of familial paraganglioma are caused by mutations in the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH; succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) subunit genes (<em>SDHB</em>, <em>SDHC</em>, <em>SDHD</em>, <em>SDHAF2</em>, <em>SDHA</em>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Familial paraganglioma'</a> above.)</p><p>Genetic testing should be considered if a patient has one or more of the following (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Genetic screening'</a> above):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paraganglioma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bilateral adrenal pheochromocytoma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unilateral adrenal pheochromocytoma and a family history of <span class=\"nowrap\">pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unilateral adrenal pheochromocytoma onset at a young age (eg, &lt;45 years), or</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other clinical findings suggestive of one of the previously discussed syndromic disorders (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Genetic screening'</a> above)</p><p/><p>An asymptomatic person at risk for disease on the basis of family history of <span class=\"nowrap\">pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma</span> should have genetic testing only if an affected family member has a known mutation.</p><p>The specific genetic tests ordered should be based upon the patient presentation.
