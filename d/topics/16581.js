Atrial premature beats (APBs), also referred to as atrial premature complexes, premature atrial beats, premature atrial complexes, or atrial extrasystoles, are triggered from the atrial myocardium in a variety of situations and occur in a broad spectrum of the population. This includes patients without structural heart disease and those with any form of cardiac disease, independent of severity.</p><p>The prevalence, mechanisms, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of APBs will be presented here. A discussion of ventricular premature beats is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ventricular-premature-beats\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ventricular premature beats&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>APBs are fairly ubiquitous, occurring commonly in both young and older adult subjects and in those with and without significant heart disease. </p><p>The prevalence of APBs is highly dependent upon the technique used for evaluation. APBs are less commonly seen on standard 10-second electrocardiogram compared with 24-hour or longer duration Holter monitoring. In a cross-sectional analysis of 1742 Swiss adults (50 years of age or older) from the general population who underwent Holter monitoring for 24 hours, 99 percent had at least one APB during the monitoring period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supraventricular-premature-beats/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In this Swiss cohort, the frequency of APBs steadily increased with age, with rates of 0.8, 1.4, and 2.6 APBs per hour among participants aged 50 to 55 years, 60 to 65 years, and 70 or more years, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supraventricular-premature-beats/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Similar findings of greater APB frequency with advancing age have been reported in other cohorts as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supraventricular-premature-beats/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>The presence and frequency of APBs is dependent upon the presence of structural heart disease. APBs are particularly frequent in patients with mitral valve disease and in those with left ventricular dysfunction regardless of etiology. However, the high prevalence of APBs in the normal population makes such associations uncertain. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> below.)</p><p>The wide range in the reported prevalence of APBs in different populations may be related to the day-to-day variability in their prevalence and frequency. Circadian variation in the frequency of APBs may also occur, but there is significant interpatient variation. In the Copenhagen Holter Study cohort, in which 638 persons (ages 55 to 75 years) underwent up to 48-hour Holter recording and were followed for a median 14 years, a circadian variation was observed in the group with frequent APBs <span class=\"nowrap\">(&ge;720/day;</span> n = 66 persons), with the fewest <span class=\"nowrap\">APBs/hour</span> observed during the night with a nadir at 6 AM and then reaching a peak value in the afternoon at 3 PM Runs of APBs in all subjects showed a similar circadian variation, while the risk of atrial fibrillation was equal in all time intervals throughout the day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supraventricular-premature-beats/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>Junctional premature beats (JPBs) occur less commonly than both APBs and ventricular premature beats and are rarely seen in clinical practice. Their prevalence has not been well studied due in part to their scarcity as well as difficulty in making the correct diagnosis. In addition, many studies combine JPBs and APBs into one category of supraventricular premature beats.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H538018031\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since invasive testing is rarely performed in patients with only simple APBs, there is little information about the mechanisms of APBs in humans. Although the mechanisms responsible for spontaneous APBs are not clear or well investigated, it seems likely that multiple mechanisms are responsible for APBs in different patients, depending upon the clinical situation. Possible mechanisms, which are discussed in greater detail elsewhere, include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reentry within the atrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supraventricular-premature-beats/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reentry-and-the-development-of-cardiac-arrhythmias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reentry and the development of cardiac arrhythmias&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal automaticity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supraventricular-premature-beats/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enhanced-cardiac-automaticity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Enhanced cardiac automaticity&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Triggered activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supraventricular-premature-beats/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ventricular-premature-beats#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ventricular premature beats&quot;, section on 'Triggered activity'</a>)</p><p/><p>Although the mechanisms responsible for JPBs are not clear or well investigated, they are most likely due to abnormal automaticity.

Furthermore, the incidence of APBs is variable in different forms of structural heart disease.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Idiopathic APBs &ndash; In patients without structural heart disease, APBs frequently originate from the pulmonary veins. APBs have long been observed to precede the degeneration of sinus rhythm into atrial fibrillation and are thus considered the main triggers of this common arrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supraventricular-premature-beats/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Toxins or chemicals &ndash; Smoking, alcohol, and coffee are widely considered as potential precipitants of APBs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supraventricular-premature-beats/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Smoking and alcohol are known to increase sympathetic tone, which may affect the frequency of APBs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supraventricular-premature-beats/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Although there is a widespread belief that caffeine, particularly at high doses, is associated with palpitations and a number of arrhythmias, there is no evidence that it is proarrhythmic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supraventricular-premature-beats/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Caffeine has clear electrophysiologic effects on the atria, although the association with APBs is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supraventricular-premature-beats/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In a study of 1388 participants in the Cardiovascular Health Study, in which caffeine consumption was self-reported and patients underwent 24-hour ambulatory monitoring, there was no significant differences in the frequency of APBs between users and non-users of caffeine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supraventricular-premature-beats/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Nevertheless, there are patients who may be more sensitive to caffeine and note a relationship of palpitations to caffeine intake. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Theophylline</a>, another methylxanthine compound, also may increase APB frequency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supraventricular-premature-beats/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute myocardial infarction &ndash; Patients with an acute myocardial infarction (MI) have an early increase in the frequency of APBs, with an incidence ranging from 25 to 81 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supraventricular-premature-beats/abstract/1,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,18,19</a>]. One study noted a mean of 9 to 14 APBs per hour on day 1 post-MI, which decreased to one to two APBs per hour on day 10 post-MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supraventricular-premature-beats/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. <br/></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coronary heart disease &ndash; Among patients with known or suspected coronary heart disease, APBs can be induced during exercise testing, but the prognostic importance of APBs during exercise testing remains unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supraventricular-premature-beats/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stress-testing-to-determine-prognosis-of-coronary-heart-disease#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stress testing to determine prognosis of coronary heart disease&quot;, section on 'Atrial arrhythmias'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other heart diseases &ndash; The frequency of APBs appears to be increased in mitral stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and any condition that results in an elevation in pressure or dilatation of the right or left atrium including cardiomyopathy or valvular heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supraventricular-premature-beats/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) &ndash; In patients with COPD, bronchodilator use has been identified as a significant risk factor for increased APBs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supraventricular-premature-beats/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p/><p>JPBs may occur in subjects with normal or abnormal hearts. Their presence may be increased by hypokalemia, digitalis toxicity, chronic lung disease, acute ischemia or myocardial infarction, excessive caffeine, nicotine or alcohol use, amphetamine use, stress, valvular heart disease, pericarditis, heart failure, hyperthyroidism, or inflammatory changes in the AV junction following heart surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H538017237\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of APBs is associated with several characteristic findings on history, physical examination, and electrocardiogram (ECG). </p><p>APBs may be asymptomatic or cause symptoms such as a sensation of &quot;skipping&quot; or palpitations. APBs are often single and isolated, but they may be frequent and may occur in a bigeminal pattern. Although APBs have a wide array of manifestations, they are not life-threatening by themselves. In predisposed individuals, APBs may initiate supraventricular and, less commonly, ventricular arrhythmias, with atrial fibrillation (AF) being the most common arrhythmia induced by APBs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supraventricular-premature-beats/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H632922389\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>APBs produce few or no symptoms in the vast majority of patients (as is also the case in most persons with ventricular premature beats), although some individuals may experience palpitations or dizziness. APBs rarely cause true hemodynamic compromise, except when they are associated with an underlying bradycardia.</p><p>APBs may lead to palpitations (when there is a pause and increased left ventricular inotropy resulting from an increase in stroke volume) or the sensation of skipped beats which may be due to nonconducted APBs or ineffective contraction resulting from poor filling of the left ventricle during the premature beat. Atrial bigeminy with nonconducted APBs may lead to ventricular rates approaching 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min,</span> possibly leading to symptoms (ie, lightheadedness, dizziness, presyncope) related to the bradyarrhythmia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72122\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef72122 \">waveform 1</a>).</p><p>Frequent APBs have been associated with a reversible cardiomyopathy in animal models, with rare case reports in humans. This is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arrhythmia-induced-cardiomyopathy#H18539509\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy&quot;, section on 'Frequent atrial ectopy'</a>.)</p><p>Most subjects with junctional premature beats (JPBs), like most subjects with APBs, are asymptomatic. However, JPBs may lead to symptoms of palpitations or the sensation of skipped beats. Concealed JPBs that lead to second degree AV block may be associated with symptoms of lightheadedness or near syncope, particularly if they occur in a bigeminal pattern.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H632922412\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most characteristic finding on physical exam is the presence of an irregular pulse resulting from the presence of APBs or JPBs during the examination. Palpation of the peripheral pulse will demonstrate either premature pulse waves or pauses. Early APBs may lead to cannon A waves on the jugular venous pulsations as they may occur while the AV valves are still closed from the previous ventricular systole. This finding may be particularly helpful in differentiating early nonconducted APBs from sinus pauses. Auscultation of the heart may detect early heart sounds or pauses. APBs and JPBs may also lead to changes in the intensity or timing of a variety of cardiac murmurs (such as those due to mitral valve prolapse) due to the reduction in diastolic filling time and a reduction in ventricular volumes. These changes may be reversed with the post extrasystolic beat since there is an increase in ventricular volume due to the pause. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of cardiac murmurs in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H372318073\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An ECG should be part of the standard evaluation for any patient with suspected APBs or JPBs. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H372318110\"><span class=\"h3\">ECG findings with APBs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>APBs are observed on the surface electrocardiogram as a P wave that occurs relatively early in the cardiac cycle (ie, prematurely before the next sinus P wave should occur) and has a different morphology and axis from the sinus P wave. Often the PR interval is different from that during sinus rhythm; it may be longer or shorter, depending upon the site of origin of the APB. With faster baseline heart rates, the abnormal P wave may be hidden within the preceding T wave, producing a &quot;peaked&quot; or &quot;camel hump&quot; type of T wave. If this is not apparent to the interpreting clinician, the APB may be mistaken for a JPB.

APBs that originate from the left atrium typically have shorter conduction times than those originating from the right atrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supraventricular-premature-beats/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>An incomplete compensatory pause follows an APB due to resetting of the sinus node by the APB, with the subsequent sinus beat occurring slightly earlier than would be expected in sinus rhythm (less than twice the sinus P-P interval). This is in contrast to the fully compensatory pause which is observed after a ventricular premature beat. Rarely, one may encounter interpolated APBs without a compensatory pause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supraventricular-premature-beats/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>A nonconducted APB, especially one that may be obscured by the T wave, may give the false appearance of a sinus pause or sinoatrial exit block (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77154\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef77154 \">waveform 3</a>). Evaluation of multiple leads may be required to detect the APB, since it may cause a discernible deflection, seen as a deformity of the normal T wave, in only one or a few ECG leads.

They are most often detected when there is a premature beat with a normal QRS complex <strong>and</strong>:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A P wave with a PR interval that is too short to be considered to be conducted through the AV node (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F62336\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef62336 \">waveform 4</a>). Although the upper limits of the conduction times (PR interval) consistent with JPBs have not been defined, a premature complex with a PR interval less than 90 msec is unlikely to reflect a conducted APB.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No P wave.

In this setting, they may be indistinguishable on the ECG from premature ventricular depolarizations. In this setting, only intracardiac recording of His bundle activation will differentiate between these two possibilities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=invasive-cardiac-electrophysiology-studies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Invasive cardiac electrophysiology studies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>JPBs may also conduct retrogradely to the atrium and demonstrate conduction block to the ventricles. In this setting, they are similar to APBs and are indistinguishable from nonconducted APBs on the surface ECG. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H372318472\"><span class=\"h3\">Ambulatory monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with palpitations or other symptoms suggesting APBs, but an unrevealing physical examination and ECG, should undergo ambulatory monitoring. In evaluating patients with suspected APBs, 24 to 48 hours of ambulatory ECG monitoring significantly increases the likelihood of making the diagnosis, given the sporadic nature of APBs in most patients. In addition, 24-hour Holter monitoring is also the best accepted approach to quantifying the frequency of APBs as a percentage of total heart beats. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-palpitations-in-adults#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of palpitations in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H372318412\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of an APB is made when a P wave with a morphology different from that of the sinus P wave (inverted or biphasic) occurs earlier than the anticipated sinus P wave (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F66489\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef66489 \">waveform 5</a>). If the ectopic focus is near the sinus node, the P wave may be similar to that of the sinus P.

(See <a href=\"#H372318073\" class=\"local\">'Electrocardiography'</a> above.)</p><p>Once APBs (or JPBs) have been identified, an additional evaluation should be performed focusing on the presence or absence of underlying structural heart disease. For patients in whom otherwise unexplained APBs have been identified, the following evaluation should be performed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>24-hour ambulatory (Holter) monitor to quantify the frequency of APBs and determine if they are monomorphic or multimorphic</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Echocardiography to assess cardiac structure and function</p><p/><p>Further testing is indicated only when this initial evaluation identifies significant abnormalities that require further evaluation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">EP testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no indications for performing electrophysiology (EP) studies in patients with APBs. JPBs generally do not require invasive electrophysiologic investigation unless there is a question of infra-His conduction disease, as in the patient with &quot;pseudo AV block&quot; who may possibly have Mobitz II second-degree AV block. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=second-degree-atrioventricular-block-mobitz-type-ii\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Second degree atrioventricular block: Mobitz type II&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, when APBs occur in a patient undergoing EP study for another reason, EP findings include an atrial activation sequence that is different from the sinus activation sequence, and normal conduction through the AV node and His-Purkinje system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70505\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef70505 \">waveform 6</a>). Additionally, functional bundle branch block may be seen, leading to HV interval prolongation. Nonconducted APBs typically demonstrate block at the AV node.

The presence of frequent APBs should precipitate a diagnostic evaluation for the possible presence of underlying structural heart disease, which has prognostic significance and may require specific therapy.</p><p>No therapy is required for APBs or JPBs in the asymptomatic individual. For patients with symptomatic APBs, simple reassurance regarding the benign nature of APBs is frequently adequate to alleviate symptoms. In addition, patients should be counselled to avoid or minimize potential APB precipitants (ie, smoking, caffeine intake, alcohol intake, stress).</p><p>Options for therapy in patients with symptomatic APBs include medical therapy and, in patients with persistent symptoms, catheter ablation. However, there are few direct data to guide the choice of medical therapies, with most of the available data derived from case reports or small case series. Much of the rationale for the use of certain medications is drawn from their use in the treatment of other arrhythmias (eg, supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, ventricular premature beats). In addition, there are no studies that directly compare medical therapies with each other or with catheter ablation.</p><p>Due to their low frequency of JPBs and even rarer incidence of significant symptoms, the appropriate treatment of symptomatic JPBs has not been evaluated. Reassurance of the benign nature of this rhythm abnormality may alleviate symptoms. For patients with persistent, limiting symptoms due to JPBs, therapy is similar to that for APBs, with beta blockers as the primary option. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H632922797\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with ongoing symptomatic APBs following efforts to minimize potential APB precipitants (ie, smoking, caffeine intake, alcohol intake, stress), we suggest medical therapy with a beta blocker if no contraindication exists for its use (eg, oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a> 25 mg twice daily with uptitration as needed for effect). Beta blockers can reduce the symptoms related to APBs and may reduce their frequency, particularly if they are due to enhanced automaticity related to enhanced sympathetic output. Beta blockers do not suppress APBs but may be useful to reduce symptoms by reducing the increased inotropy seen with the post extrasystolic beat (ie, post extrasystolic potentiation).

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>APBs are fairly ubiquitous, occurring commonly in both young and older adult subjects and in those with and without significant heart disease. The prevalence of APBs is highly dependent upon the technique used for evaluation. APBs are less commonly seen on standard 10-second electrocardiogram compared with 24-hour or longer duration Holter monitoring. JPBs occur less commonly than both APBs and ventricular premature beats and are rarely seen in clinical practice. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because APBs and JPBs occur frequently in subjects with normal hearts as well as in persons with known cardiovascular disease, it is difficult to establish a definite relationship to other disorders or to delineate the factors that predispose to these extra beats. Furthermore, the incidence of APBs is variable in different forms of structural heart disease. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>APBs and JPBs may be asymptomatic or cause symptoms such as a sensation of &quot;skipping&quot; or palpitations, though they produce few or no symptoms in the vast majority of patients. The most characteristic finding on physical exam is the presence of an irregular pulse resulting from the presence of APBs or JPBs during the examination. (See <a href=\"#H538017237\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnostic evaluation of patients with symptoms suggesting APBs (or JPBs) should focus on documenting their presence or absence with an electrocardiogram (ECG) or some form of ambulatory cardiac monitoring. Once APBs (or JPBs) have been identified, an additional evaluation should be performed focusing on the presence or absence of underlying structural heart disease. (See <a href=\"#H632922489\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>APBs are observed on the surface electrocardiogram as a P wave that occurs relatively early in the cardiac cycle (ie, prematurely before the next sinus P wave should occur) and has a different morphology from the sinus P wave. Often the PR interval is different from that during sinus rhythm; it may be longer or shorter, depending upon the site of origin of the APB. The ECG findings associated with JPBs are discussed in the text. (See <a href=\"#H372318110\" class=\"local\">'ECG findings with APBs'</a> above and <a href=\"#H372318292\" class=\"local\">'ECG findings with JPBs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of an APB is made when a P wave with a morphology different from that of the sinus P wave (inverted or biphasic) occurs earlier than the anticipated sinus P wave (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F66489\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef66489 \">waveform 5</a>). If the ectopic focus is near the sinus node, the P wave may be similar to that of the sinus P. However, every lead should be examined as subtle differences in morphology may be present. (See <a href=\"#H372318073\" class=\"local\">'Electrocardiography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In persons found to have frequent APBs or JPBs, further evaluation and management is based on the presence or absence of underlying structural heart disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>No therapy is required for APBs or JPBs in the asymptomatic individual. For patients with symptomatic APBs, simple reassurance regarding the benign nature of APBs is frequently adequate to alleviate symptoms. In addition, patients should be counselled to avoid or minimize potential APB precipitants (ie, smoking, caffeine intake, alcohol intake, stress).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with ongoing symptomatic APBs following efforts to minimize potential APB precipitants we suggest a trial of medical therapy with a beta blocker (eg, oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a> 25 mg twice daily with uptitration as needed for effect) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>When APBs are symptomatic and documented to trigger AF, they may be a target for catheter ablation, particularly in patients with concern for cardiomyopathy due to frequent APBs or those with persistent APBs and symptoms in spite of medical therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Due to their low frequency of JPBs and even rarer incidence of significant symptoms, the appropriate treatment of symptomatic JPBs has not been evaluated. Reassurance of the benign nature of this rhythm abnormality may alleviate symptoms.
