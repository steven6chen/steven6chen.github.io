Women with an inherited thrombophilia are at higher risk of VTE, especially during use of estrogen-progestin contraceptives and pregnancy. In making contraceptive choices, affected women need to balance the risk of VTE associated with use of various types of hormonal contraception against the risk of VTE associated with an unintended pregnancy resulting from use of less effective contraceptive methods.</p><p>This topic will discuss contraceptive counseling for women with an inherited thrombophilia.

Women with an inherited thrombophilia should be counseled that pregnancy and the postpartum period are associated with a significantly increased risk of VTE, and these risks may exceed the VTE risk of a particular contraceptive method. As for all women, the general advantages and disadvantages of each contraceptive method also need to be reviewed.

In contrast to condoms or the diaphragm, it does not require ongoing effort on the part of the user and is highly effective for at least 10 years after insertion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57795\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57795 \">figure 1</a>). The IUD is economical when used over as little as a two-year period and, like other nonhormonal methods, it provides prompt return of fertility after removal. The main disadvantages of the copper-releasing IUD are its initial cost and a possible increased volume of menstrual bleeding.</p><p>Nonhormonal methods of contraception are discussed in detail separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrauterine-contraception-candidates-and-device-selection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrauterine contraception: Candidates and device selection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=male-condoms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Male condoms&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=female-condoms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Female condoms&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pericoital-contraception-diaphragm-cervical-cap-spermicide-and-sponge\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pericoital contraception: Diaphragm, cervical cap, spermicide, and sponge&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGESTIN-ONLY METHODS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Progestin-only methods (eg, oral, injection, intrauterine device [IUD], implant) are in the top two tiers of contraceptive efficacy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57795\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57795 \">figure 1</a>) and most available data have not demonstrated a significantly increased risk of thrombosis in users. The authors believe it is prudent to avoid injectable progestins for contraception in women with inherited thrombophilias, because of evidence (discussed below) of possible prothrombotic effects of injectable progestins and the availability of oral and intrauterine alternatives that have not been associated with increased thrombogenicity.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 2012 systematic review of cohort and case-control studies of women using progestin-only contraception (oral, injectable, or intrauterine but not implants) versus women in a no-progestin control group, venous thrombosis (VTE) risk was similar in both groups (adjusted RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.76-1.39; eight studies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-counseling-for-women-with-inherited-thrombophilias/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, subgroup analysis suggested a higher risk of thrombotic events for women using an injectable progestin (RR 2.67, 95% CI 1.29-5.53; two studies), but not for those using oral progestins (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.57-1.45; seven studies) or an intrauterine progestin (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.24-1.53; two studies). A limitation of observational studies is the possibility that patients taking injectable progestin contraception had higher baseline risks of VTE than those using oral or intrauterine progestins. The relatively small number of thromboembolic events in women of reproductive age and the small number of studies also limit the reliability of the findings.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a case-control study published after the review, women with a first episode of <span class=\"nowrap\">VTE/pulmonary</span> embolism were twice as likely to be depot <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> (DMPA) users than were controls in the general population (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.3-4.0; 47 of 948 [5 percent] VTE cases and 23 of 902 [2.5 percent] controls were DMPA users) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-counseling-for-women-with-inherited-thrombophilias/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Absolute risks are difficult to determine because of the small number of these events in young women, even those with risk factors for VTE. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risks-and-side-effects-associated-with-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risks and side effects associated with estrogen-progestin contraceptives&quot;, section on 'Venous thromboembolic disease'</a>.)</p><p>A 2007 systematic review of methodologically acceptable community and cohort studies concluded the most valid estimate of background VTE incidence in young women was 5 to 10 per 10,000 women-years, which is higher than the reference range of 0.5 to 1 per 10,000 woman-years often utilized as the baseline risk for nonuser controls in studies of VTE risk in hormonal contraception users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-counseling-for-women-with-inherited-thrombophilias/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Most data on VTE risk in users of estrogen-progestin contraception was derived from studies of COC users, but generally applies to other estrogen-progestin preparations. Observational studies have consistently reported a two- to sevenfold increased risk of VTE in COC users compared with nonusers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-counseling-for-women-with-inherited-thrombophilias/abstract/5-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-13</a>], but the risk varies by dose of estrogen and may also depend on the type of estrogen and progestin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-counseling-for-women-with-inherited-thrombophilias/abstract/3,5,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,12</a>]. The following studies show that VTE risk is 1.5- to 2-fold higher in women using third-generation COCs than in those using second-generation COCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-counseling-for-women-with-inherited-thrombophilias/abstract/3,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,13,14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2015 case-control study that included over 10,000 women with VTE reported a 3.64 to 4.28 increased risk of VTE in women taking COCs containing desogestrel, gestodene, cyproterone, or drospirenone compared with a 2.38 increased risk of VTE in women taking COCs with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-counseling-for-women-with-inherited-thrombophilias/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study determined VTE risk for patients taking COCs with the same dose of estrogen and length of use but different progestins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-counseling-for-women-with-inherited-thrombophilias/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

The estrogen implicated in these and other evaluations is ethinyl estradiol. Whether estrogens such as 17 beta estradiol increase deep vein thrombosis (DVT) risk is not known.</p><p>The increased risk of VTE associated with COCs is even higher in users with an inherited thrombophilia, and highest in users with two or more different thrombophilic defects or homozygosity for a single defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-counseling-for-women-with-inherited-thrombophilias/abstract/3,7,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,16,17</a>]. In the Leiden Thrombophilia Study, the relative risks of a first VTE in normal controls, COC users, FVL carriers, FVL carriers using COCs, and FVL homozygotes using COCs were approximately 1, 4, 7, 35, and 100, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-counseling-for-women-with-inherited-thrombophilias/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>For all women, the risk of VTE is substantially increased in <span class=\"nowrap\">pregnancy/postpartum,</span> and this risk is higher than during use of estrogen-progestin contraception.

Of this cohort, 301 women had a FVL or prothrombin gene mutation (single gene defect [n = 251], combined gene defect [n = 50]) and 50 women had a first-episode VTE.

The risk of VTE in estrogen-progestin contraception users is increased in women with a single or combined mutation compared with women without inherited thrombophilia (adjusted hazard ratio 2.2, 95% CI 1.1-4.0) and highly increased during <span class=\"nowrap\">pregnancy/postpartum</span> (adjusted hazard ratio 16.0, 95% CI 8.0-32.2). It should be noted, however, that women without an inherited thrombophilia are at higher risk of VTE during pregnancy than nonpregnant women with a single thrombophilia defect who use estrogen-progestin contraception. Limitations of the study were that some VTEs were not established by objective techniques, not all relatives were tested for all thrombophilic defects, and recall bias.</p><p>For a hypothetical group of 100,000 women over one year, the authors estimated the total number of VTEs in women with a thrombophilic defect would be 586 in condom users and 556 in estrogen-progestin users without a thrombophilic defect. Estrogen-progestin users had a slightly lower rate of VTE than condom users because the latter were far more likely to have an unintended pregnancy.

We inform women heterozygous for FVL but with no personal or family history of VTE of an estimated 0.29 percent per year increase in risk of VTE if they use estrogen-progestin contraception compared with a baseline increased risk for VTE of 0.06 percent from the thrombophilia alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-counseling-for-women-with-inherited-thrombophilias/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

As with all women seeking contraception, women with an inherited thrombophilia should be counseled about the advantages and disadvantages of the spectrum of contraceptive options, including the risk of unintended pregnancy. Because this population is at increased risk of VTE, we suggest the following approach: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Estrogen-progestin contraceptives should be avoided in women with a personal history of VTE.

For women who want the <span class=\"nowrap\">oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea</span> induced by progestin-only methods and are willing to accept uncertainty about a possible small increase in risk of VTE, we suggest a levonorgestrel-releasing IUD rather than the progestin-only implant because hormonal effects are primarily local (endometrium) with an IUD (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).

Given possible prothrombotic effects of injectable progestins (depot <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> [DMPA]) and the availability of oral progestin-only alternatives that have not been associated with increased thrombogenicity, the authors favor an oral progestin-only method rather than an injectable progestin.
