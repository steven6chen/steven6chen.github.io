There are 2 main types of the disorder:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fall-onset SAD</strong> &ndash; This type of SAD starts in late fall and goes away in the spring and summer. Some people call it &quot;winter depression.&quot; It is the most common form of SAD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Spring-onset SAD</strong> &ndash; This type of SAD starts in the spring and goes away in the fall and winter. Spring-onset SAD is much less common than fall-onset SAD.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H282385693\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of SAD?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms are the same as in regular (non-seasonal) depression.</p><p>Depressed people feel down most of the time for at least 2 weeks. They also have at least 1 of these 2 symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They no longer enjoy or care about doing the things they used to like to do.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They feel sad, down, hopeless, or cranky most of the day, almost every day.</p><p/><p>Depression can also make you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lose or gain weight</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep too much or too little</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feel tired or like you have no energy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feel guilty or like you are worth nothing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Forget things or feel confused</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Move and speak more slowly than usual</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Act restless or have trouble staying still</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Think about death or suicide</p><p/><p>However, the symptoms are different depending on which form of SAD a person has.</p><p>People with fall-onset SAD tend to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep more than usual</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a bigger appetite than usual, especially for sweet or starchy foods, like pastries or rice</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gain weight</p><p/><p>People with spring-onset SAD have symptoms that are more like those of typical depression. They tend to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep less than usual</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a smaller appetite</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lose weight</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H282385708\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, if you have symptoms of SAD, see a doctor, nurse, or counselor.</p><p>If you ever feel like you might hurt yourself or someone else, do one of these things:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Call your doctor or nurse and tell them it is an emergency</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Go to the emergency room at your local hospital</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">1-800-273-8255</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><a href=\"http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/&amp;token=Or7v6ARWAbZn5SccEnrdvHwhSdzQ5/zYISwtFHqat7NV22+e2BoqmPi4HRy5AOzPaimq849SRlcl8bAuvaNl5A==&amp;TOPIC_ID=83541\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org</a></p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H282385723\"><span class=\"h1\">How is SAD treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment options include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Light therapy</strong> &ndash; Light therapy involves sitting in front of special, bright lamps during the day. This form of therapy can help people with fall-onset SAD. It must be done with help of a doctor or counselor who knows how to give the therapy. It's not something people should try to do on their own.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medicines called antidepressants</strong> &ndash; The same medicines used to treat depression can help people with SAD. There are many different antidepressant medicines that doctors can prescribe. The medicines work in different ways and can cause different side effects. If one medicine causes problems or does not work, there are often others to try. If the medicines work well, some patients stop and start the medicines every year, while other patients take the medicines all year round. The best plan for you will depend on your situation and preferences.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Counseling</strong> <strong>(also called &quot;psychotherapy&quot;)</strong> &ndash; Counseling can help with SAD. In addition, people with SAD who get counseling might be less likely to have their SAD come back in the following years.</p><p/><p>Experts think that light therapy plus antidepressant medicines is often the best treatment to try first for fall-onset SAD. Some people with SAD are treated with only light therapy, but only if they are not severely depressed or thinking about suicide. For people who are severely depressed or thinking about suicide, antidepressant medicines might be a better option.</p><p>You and your doctor, nurse, or counselor can decide which treatment is best for you.</p><p>Whatever treatment you try, keep in mind that it sometimes takes patience to find a treatment that works. In some cases, people who take medicines have to try a few different medicines before they find one that works for them. Plus, most treatments take some time before they start working. The key is to work with your doctor, nurse, or counselor, and to keep him or her informed about any problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H282385738\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Some people feel better if they exercise. Even you do not feel like it, try to do something active for at least 30 minutes on most days of the week.</p><p>Also, if you have fall-onset SAD, make sure you get exposed to as much light as possible. Here are some ways you can do that:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follow good sleep habits &ndash; That means that you:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sleep only long enough to feel rested and then get out of bed</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Go to bed and get up at the same time every day</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Do not try to force yourself to sleep. If you can't sleep, get out of bed and try again later.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Have coffee, tea, and other foods that have caffeine only in the morning</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Avoid alcohol in the late afternoon, evening, and bedtime</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Avoid smoking, especially in the evening</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Keep your bedroom dark, cool, quiet, and free of reminders of work or other things that cause you stress</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Solve problems you have before you go to bed</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Exercise several days a week, but not right before bed</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Avoid looking at phones or reading devices (&quot;e-books&quot;) that give off light before bed. This can make it harder to fall asleep.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take walks outside during the day, so that you get some sun.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In your bedroom, put a lamp on a timer and have it turn on in the early morning, even before the sun comes out.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get a &quot;dawn-simulating&quot; lamp, which brightens gradually and turns on before the sun comes out.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H282385753\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=depression-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Depression (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-depression-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for depression (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=depression-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Depression in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
