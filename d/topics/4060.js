Radiation-induced fibrosis may cause both cosmetic and functional impairment, which can lead to death or significant deterioration in quality of life.</p><p>The development of radiation-induced fibrosis is influenced by multiple factors, including radiation dose and volume, fractionation schedule, previous or concurrent treatments, genetic susceptibility, and comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus. Although radiation-induced fibrosis originally was assumed to be a slow, irreversible process, contemporary studies suggest that it is not necessarily a fixed process.</p><p>The prevention of radiation-induced fibrosis has focused on improvements in RT technique, which have resulted in higher doses to the tumor target and decreased doses to normal tissue, thus potentially preventing the development of radiation-induced fibrosis. Furthermore, established radiation-induced fibrosis may be treatable with novel therapeutic approaches, particularly the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentoxifylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentoxifylline</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-e-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin E</a>.</p><p>The pathogenesis, diagnosis, clinical manifestations, prevention, and treatment of radiation-induced fibrosis will be discussed here. Radiation-induced changes in the lungs and gastrointestinal tract are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-induced-lung-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation-induced lung injury&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-management-of-chronic-radiation-enteritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and management of chronic radiation enteritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiation-induced fibrosis is similar to inflammation, wound healing, and fibrosis of any origin. Typical histologic features include the presence of inflammatory infiltrates, particularly macrophages in the earlier stages of fibrosis, differentiation of fibroblasts into postmitotic fibrocytes, and changes in the vascular connective tissue with excessive production and deposition of extracellular matrix proteins and collagen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-prevention-and-treatment-of-radiation-induced-fibrosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The development of fibrosis is mediated by cytokine expression that probably begins immediately after radiation therapy (RT) and continues for months or years. Inflammatory mediators that have been implicated include tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukins 6 and 1 (IL-6 and IL-1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-prevention-and-treatment-of-radiation-induced-fibrosis/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. Fibrogenic cytokines that modulate the proliferation and differentiation of fibroblasts and the synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins and matrix metalloproteinases include transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Other growth factors, such as the connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), which is secreted by fibroblasts and endothelial cells, also promote fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-prevention-and-treatment-of-radiation-induced-fibrosis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>Radiation-induced alterations of the vascular system, particularly damage to endothelial cells, appear to contribute significantly to late toxicity. Damage to the myocardium after RT for breast cancer has been associated with changes of the microvasculature, resulting in reduced perfusion and fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-prevention-and-treatment-of-radiation-induced-fibrosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Hyalinoid changes of the capillary wall and a rarefication of the capillary net are typically seen in fibrotic areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-prevention-and-treatment-of-radiation-induced-fibrosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGIC FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of factors influence the response to radiation, thus increasing the incidence of complications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">RT parameters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of radiation-induced fibrosis is increased with higher radiation doses and larger treated volumes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-prevention-and-treatment-of-radiation-induced-fibrosis/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. The radiation dose that causes fibrosis can vary substantially in different tissues, as is illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fibrosis in both connective and vascular tissues is generally associated with total radiation doses of 60 Gy or higher.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, the heart is relatively sensitive to radiation, and relatively low doses of radiation therapy (RT) can cause peri-, myo-, or endocardial fibrosis. Thus, incidental radiation to the heart should be minimized, and radiation doses to the whole heart should be kept small. Similarly, the lungs are relatively sensitive to radiation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-breast-cancer-and-other-malignancies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiotoxicity of radiation therapy for breast cancer and other malignancies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-induced-lung-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation-induced lung injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The technique of RT administration can have a major effect on the dose of radiation received by normal tissues. Examples of situations where the risk of radiation-induced fibrosis is influenced by the RT technique include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin induration is more frequent in women treated with overlapping tangential breast fields and internal mammary lymph node fields [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-prevention-and-treatment-of-radiation-induced-fibrosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of radiation-induced fibrosis is increased with high single doses of RT (eg, intraoperative radiation treatment, single-fraction external beam RT, brachytherapy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-prevention-and-treatment-of-radiation-induced-fibrosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fibrosis may be more common when different RT techniques are combined. As an example, the combination of external beam RT with interstitial and intracavitary brachytherapy for gynecological tumors can cause radiation-induced fibrosis of the ureter and vagina, as well as late toxicity to the large and small bowel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-prevention-and-treatment-of-radiation-induced-fibrosis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of multiple fractions per day increases the risk of radiation-induced fibrosis. In a randomized trial in patients with lung cancer, the risk of dysphagia was higher two years after treatment with hyperfractionated RT compared with conventional fractionation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-prevention-and-treatment-of-radiation-induced-fibrosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postoperative, as opposed to preoperative, administration of RT is associated with an increased risk of late radiation complications in sarcoma patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-prevention-and-treatment-of-radiation-induced-fibrosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In men with prostate cancer, patients with a history of abdominal surgery or a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) had an increased risk for late RT complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-prevention-and-treatment-of-radiation-induced-fibrosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Higher doses of RT not only increase the incidence of fibrosis, but also shorten the latent period until late sequelae are apparent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-prevention-and-treatment-of-radiation-induced-fibrosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p>During RT planning, organ-specific guidelines are used to limit the dose to normal tissue. With this information, the risk for radiation-related sequelae can be estimated, and volume-dependent dose limits can be generated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1066812351\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genetic variation in the response to radiation may be associated with an increased incidence of radiation-induced fibrosis.</p><p>As an example, there is a higher risk of subcutaneous fibrosis in patients with breast cancer who have specific modifications of the <em>ATM</em> gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-prevention-and-treatment-of-radiation-induced-fibrosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Patients with other diseases associated with deficient DNA repair may also be more likely to develop symptoms of radiation-induced fibrosis. Fortunately, dramatic increases in the risk of radiation fibrosis are limited to the rare occurrence of these known genetic disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1066812358\"><span class=\"h2\">Connective tissue diseases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with connective tissue diseases, such as scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis, or systemic lupus erythematosus, may have an increased incidence of toxicity from RT, but the magnitude of this risk is not clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-prevention-and-treatment-of-radiation-induced-fibrosis/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. In a review of eight observational studies that included 404 patients with connective tissue diseases who were treated with RT, there was a statistically significant association with late RT-induced complications in normal tissues (fibrosis, osteonecrosis, bone fractures) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-prevention-and-treatment-of-radiation-induced-fibrosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. While not usually an absolute contraindication to RT, the severity of connective tissue disease should be taken into account when formulating the treatment plan.</p><p>Multiple factors may contribute to the association of RT complications with connective tissue diseases. The development of radiation-induced fibrosis may be affected by the concurrent use of medications such as corticosteroids and cytotoxic drugs. In addition to increasing RT toxicity, these drugs can cause osteopenia and bone fractures, which may be attributed to RT. Sequelae of connective tissue disorders, such as dry eye and dry mouth symptoms in Sj&ouml;grens syndrome, may mimic radiation-induced fibrosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1066812404\"><span class=\"h2\">Concurrent systemic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Combining RT with systemic cancer treatment has been assumed to cause a higher risk of radiation-induced toxicities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-prevention-and-treatment-of-radiation-induced-fibrosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], but clinical studies have given conflicting results.

Tamoxifen is thought to induce transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) secretion, which is a key factor in the signaling cascade leading to fibrosis. Tamoxifen may also increase the incidence of subcutaneous fibrosis when given concurrently with RT, but this has not been a consistent finding in all studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-prevention-and-treatment-of-radiation-induced-fibrosis/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In men, hormonal therapy given concurrently with RT for prostate cancer can increase the incidence of acute and late gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-prevention-and-treatment-of-radiation-induced-fibrosis/abstract/19,30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,30-32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Targeted therapies are increasingly combined with RT for a wide variety of tumor entities.

Other radiation-induced fibrosis-related symptoms exist but are less frequent.</p><p>Radiation-induced fibrosis typically presents 4 to 12 months after radiation therapy (RT) and progresses over several years. Although radiation-induced fibrosis can occur without acute symptoms during or immediately after RT, late toxicity often follows acute reactions in the same organ, either immediately or after a latency period.</p><p>Late toxicities following acute effects are termed consequential late effects and are directly dependent upon the degree and duration of acute toxicities.
