These studies have shown a morbid risk for parents of patients with schizophrenia at 6 percent and siblings with 9 percent. Most of these studies utilized a candidate gene approach that was selected based on positive associations with adult-onset schizophrenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Forty-five genes have been evaluated for a positive association between schizophrenia (regardless of age of onset) and autism. Of these identified genes, 20 showed a positive association between both disorders, and 11 were associated only with schizophrenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p>The pathogeneses of childhood-onset schizophrenia and early-onset schizophrenia are not thought to be distinctly different from the pathogenesis of adult-onset schizophrenia, although the onset of symptoms and changes in brain structures occur at earlier ages. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies examining structural brain alterations of patients diagnosed with childhood-onset schizophrenia, early-onset schizophrenia, or patients that fall in the genetic high-risk or clinical high-risk categories show progressive grey matter volume reduction in the prefrontal cortex and temporal cortex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. Decreased volume of the prefrontal cortex and temporal cortex, in particular, have been linked to greater symptom severity and earlier age of illness onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>].

Childhood-onset schizophrenia and early-onset schizophrenia are more severe and debilitating forms of schizophrenia.</p><p>Hallucinations are much more common than delusions in youth with schizophrenia compared with adults. The most common hallucinations are auditory with comments or commands being most frequently observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. These are often accompanied by visual and tactile hallucinations, resulting in multimodal hallucinations. Delays in language, motor, and social development may be pronounced, particularly in childhood-onset schizophrenia; however, these delays are not diagnostic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>The Treatment of Early-Onset Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder study of 168 children aged 8 to 19 found an inverse correlation between the presence of positive symptoms and IQ in youth with early-onset schizophrenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Youth will frequently name these hallucinations, which may lead observers to initially think that the youth are referring to &ldquo;imaginary companions.&rdquo; Delusional content related to the hallucination may be seen and the youth may be fearful that the hallucination will hurt them or a family member [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>]. </p><p>Longitudinal studies have shown that regardless of age, transition to syndromal psychosis is associated with cognitive decline. Participants in the National Institutes of Mental Health study of childhood-onset schizophrenia showed a marked decline in IQ scores approximately two years prior to the onset of frank psychosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

A meta-analysis looking at clinical high risk populations revealed a correlation between severity of cognitive deficits and rates of conversion to psychosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

In a study of 119 children with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (including early-onset schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder), 45 percent had at least one prior psychiatric hospitalization, 25 percent had issues with the legal system or reported problems with aggression, and 15 percent had a history of suicide attempts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Other studies have shown that up to 74 percent of adolescents and young adults with first-episode psychosis have co-occurring substance use, although this number is likely lower in younger populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3784901528\"><span class=\"h1\">COURSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Deviance in developmental trajectories as evidenced by abnormal developmental milestones is increased in childhood-onset schizophrenia when compared with the adult form of the disorder, resulting in a worse clinical course and outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-58</a>]. Childhood-onset schizophrenia is continuous with the adult form of the disorder, although the earlier the onset, the more severe the illness. </p><p>As an example, a comparison between 119 youth with early-onset schizophrenia and a sample with adult-onset schizophrenia found that the early-onset cohort may have had more severe symptoms on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/6,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,29</a>]. </p><p>Intellectual ability often deteriorates prior to diagnosis, and the difficulties with learning and verbal memory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>] that accompany the disorder can result in more significant impairment with earlier age of onset. In addition to a decline from baseline functioning that is associated with the syndrome, there is a failure to show age-related gains compared with healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. </p><p>Co-occurring substance use in those with psychotic illness is associated with decreased medication adherence, poorer response to treatment, and worsened course of illness in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Since early-onset schizophrenia is continuous with the adult form of the disorder, one might expect that, as in adults, concurrent substance use in youth would correlate with more frequent hospitalizations, suicide attempts, recurrence of psychotic symptoms, residential instability, legal problems, and health problems. This has not been studied in youth.</p><p>There is a dearth of data looking at predictors of relapse specifically in early-onset psychosis; however, a cohort study looking at relapse in first episode cases (age 15 to 60) showed medication adherence as the only significant predictor of relapse in a three-year follow-up period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1577776900\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical assessment should begin with a thorough personal, medication, psychosocial, and family history. Physical examination including a neurologic workup and laboratory evaluation should be obtained. Although there is no gold standard laboratory work-up battery for psychosis, evaluation of complete blood count, serum electrolytes and glucose, hepatic and renal function, thyroid stimulating hormone, syphilis test, prolactin levels, hepatitis C, vitamin B12 and folate, serum ceruloplasmin if Wilson disease is a consideration, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and antinuclear antibodies are recommended. Urinalysis, urine and serum toxicology, and human immunodeficiency virus testing should be done if there are risk factors present. </p><p>The absence of dysmorphic features, intellectual disability, or family history of mental illness should increase the suspicion of a medical or neurologic cause for symptoms. Any focal neurologic findings or history of traumatic brain injury should prompt neuroimaging by magnetic resonance imaging. Acute emergence of symptoms and evidence of delirium warrant more extensive testing and may require cerebral spinal fluid analysis, toxicology screening, and anti-N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antibodies. Positive anti-NMDA antibodies would necessitate an abdominal ultrasound or to rule out ovarian teratoma in females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/6,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,62</a>].</p><p>Interviews of patients and families, particularly with adolescents, should be done separately due to concerns of confidentiality. Collateral information from schools can be critically important, as parents may unintentionally minimize the level of disorganization in youth or inadvertently mask some of the symptoms by compensating for their impairments through providing a level of structure in the home that would be excessive compared with age-matched peers. Asking about sleep-wake disturbances may be helpful. Children may be unaware that they are experiencing auditory hallucinations. Questioning parents about whether their child appears to be responding to voices as if they were being called, without a clear precipitant, may be helpful. Social isolation or decline in school functioning and learning is also usually present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1578549998\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of schizophrenia in children and adolescents is made through clinical assessment, using the same DSM-5 diagnostic criteria as those used for the adult-onset disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H370341689\"><span class=\"h2\">DSM-5 diagnostic criteria</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A.

The six-month period must include at least one month of symptoms (or less if successfully treated) that meet criterion A (ie, active-phase symptoms) and may include periods of prodromal or residual symptoms. During these prodromal or residual periods, the signs of the disturbance may be manifested by only negative symptoms or two or more symptoms listed in criterion A that present in an attenuated form (eg, odd beliefs, unusual perceptual experiences).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>D. Schizoaffective disorder and mood disorder with psychotic features have been ruled out because either: 1) no major depressive, manic, or mixed episodes have occurred concurrently with the active-phase symptoms; or 2) if mood episodes have occurred during active-phase symptoms, their total duration has been brief relative to the duration of the active and residual periods.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>E.

If the patient has a history of autistic disorder or another pervasive developmental disorder, the additional diagnosis of schizophrenia is made only if prominent delusions or hallucinations are also present for at least a month (or less if successfully treated).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1413274815\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Posttraumatic stress disorder</strong> &ndash; Symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults can include delusional and paranoid thinking as well as flashbacks, which may be described by patients as auditory hallucinations. Hypervigilance and flashbacks can often be misinterpreted as paranoia and hallucinations, making distinguishing between the two disorders challenging. In cases of PTSD, these symptoms are most commonly related to trauma, and there is a lower incidence of disorganized thinking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>]. One meta-analysis showed strong evidence that childhood adversity is associated with an increased risk for psychosis, and therefore PTSD should be carefully considered in cases where youth have a history of childhood adversity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Autism spectrum disorders</strong> &ndash; Misdiagnosis of autism spectrum disorder symptoms as psychosis can also occur due to common features such as general impairment in social communication, which can be misinterpreted as negative symptoms of psychosis or stereotyped use of language, which could be confused as disorganized speech [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Further investigation of the developmental history and baseline thought process can be useful for distinguishing these two diagnoses. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The presence of new-onset delusions or hallucinations lasting longer than one month, presence of disordered or delusional thinking that is distinctly different from baseline, or deterioration in social and general function are more consistent with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or for a comorbid diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Schizoaffective disorder</strong> &ndash; Distinguishing between schizoaffective disorder and schizophrenia in early-onset schizophrenia may also be challenging as the psychotic syndrome continues to evolve and as the development of the youth progresses.
