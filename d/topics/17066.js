Few disagreements have drawn as much attention in the medical, legal, and public spheres as the refusal of blood transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-the-patient-who-refuses-blood-transfusion/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>Dealing with such patients and their families takes additional time and energy, which may not be available in emergency situations and may not be reimbursed. Nevertheless, clinicians are obliged to provide the best management possible, factoring in the time required to assess the specific preferences of patients and their families. A thorough understanding of these issues, combined with a precise determination of the patient&rsquo;s wishes, will enable a clinician to outline the most appropriate treatment plan or to refer the patient to an appropriate colleague when clinically possible.</p><p>This topic review will present an overview of this subject, often called &quot;bloodless medicine,&quot; which is now evolving into the field of &quot;patient blood management&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-the-patient-who-refuses-blood-transfusion/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

This provides a time period for possible intervention by transfusion medicine specialists. Among 1958 patients, 6 percent had a postoperative Hgb &lt;6 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> and one-third of these 117 patients died. Individuals with Hgb &ge;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> had at least 4.5 days between the lowest Hgb level and the time death occurred.</p><p>A 2014 report of one hospital&rsquo;s experience of 293 patients that was patterned after the above study confirms the trends toward much higher risk in lower hemoglobin ranges.

These vary widely from those who express a desire not to take in someone else&rsquo;s &quot;life force&quot; to those (such as certain Native Americans) who only accept blood from &quot;spiritual relatives.&quot; These views point to two important principles: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The need for attention to the multiple symbolic associations of blood.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The importance of practicing &quot;cultural humility&quot; in applying culture-based training to specific patients. </p><p/><p>The approach to patients needs to be broad, without preconceived notions of what is appropriate in a given population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-the-patient-who-refuses-blood-transfusion/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Culture-based training may not provide all of the answers; each patient must be approached intersectionally, understanding that the illness experience lies at the nexus of religious, political, historical, and cultural forces, all of which may have bearing on the patient&rsquo;s clinical care. Since it is impossible to generalize, it is helpful to identify specific items to remember when obtaining informed consent from these patients for various transfusable substances and procedures that involve blood, as outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F106229\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106229 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Jehovah's Witnesses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While there are a number of situations in which a patient may refuse blood transfusion, the most well-known involve Christians known as Jehovah's Witnesses (Witnesses; JW). Witnesses number well over one million active members in North America and nearly eight million worldwide. Witnesses are encouraged to purchase health insurance and avail themselves of modern medical care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-the-patient-who-refuses-blood-transfusion/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], with the exception of certain forms of blood transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-the-patient-who-refuses-blood-transfusion/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Aversion to transfusion stems from their interpretation of Biblical scripture (eg, Genesis 9:3,4; Leviticus 7:26,27; 1 Samuel 14:32,33; and Acts 15:28,29) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-the-patient-who-refuses-blood-transfusion/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Devout Witnesses generally will <strong>not</strong> accept transfusions of whole blood or any of the &quot;four major components&quot; (ie, red cells, platelets, plasma, and white blood cells) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-the-patient-who-refuses-blood-transfusion/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], and most are prepared to die rather than compromise this refusal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F67244\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67244 \">table 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many Witnesses will accept blood &quot;subfractions,&quot; such as immunoglobulins, albumin, and coagulation factor concentrates, as well as recombinant coagulation factors; the choice is left up to individual discretion and religious conscience (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F67244\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67244 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-the-patient-who-refuses-blood-transfusion/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The degree of acceptability of various products has been summarized in the literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-the-patient-who-refuses-blood-transfusion/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Devout Witnesses do <strong>not</strong> consider preoperative autologous blood donation as an acceptable alternative, due to a belief that blood should not be taken out of the body and stored for any length of time. However, if the blood circulates back into the patient (eg, cardiopulmonary bypass, therapeutic apheresis, certain intraoperative blood salvage systems), this is acceptable to many Witnesses.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Other reasons for refusal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients may decline transfusion for reasons outside of a religious or personal context. Many patients have refused transfusion due to a fear of blood-borne disease such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or because of a previous experience with a life-threatening transfusion reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-the-patient-who-refuses-blood-transfusion/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Risks'</a> above.)</p><p>The approach to such patients should differ from the approach to individuals who refuse blood for cultural or religious reasons. An understanding of the patient's psychosocial history, along with a careful explanation of the risks and benefits of transfusion particular to their situation may resolve the fear of disease. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Transfusion overview'</a> above.)</p><p>Investigation of a previous transfusion reaction may allay patient fears and provide valuable clinical information. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the patient has had a prior anaphylactic blood transfusion reaction due to IgA deficiency, prevention of future problems consists of establishing the diagnosis and using either IgA-deficient blood products, which can be obtained through large, regional blood centers, or extra-washed (two to three times) red cell or platelet products. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunologic-transfusion-reactions#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunologic transfusion reactions&quot;, section on 'Anaphylactic transfusion reactions'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selective-iga-deficiency-management-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selective IgA deficiency: Management and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The safety of the blood supply is an area of intense interest and the ability to detect viral contamination is continuously improving; this should put most people's fears of life-threatening infection to rest. For instance, the risk of transmitting HIV infection by transfusion in the United States is estimated to be approximately one in two million. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood donor screening: Laboratory testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Maintaining patient rapport</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It may be tempting to engage a patient refusing blood in debate. However, this casts the clinician into an adversarial role, making it easier for the patient to discount what the clinician is saying and retreat to a more global refusal of treatments that might otherwise have been acceptable.</p><p>Discussion aimed at convincing a Witness to violate personal religious beliefs may cause harm by pressuring the patient to compromise ethical values. An alternate approach involves serving as the patient's advocate, with the focus on finding the best possible therapy within the boundaries of the patient's religious beliefs and comfort zone (ie, values and preferences). Except in urgent circumstances, ample time should be set aside for the discussion of transfusion issues. In most cases, this discussion should occur in private, as friends or family members may influence the patient's decision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-the-patient-who-refuses-blood-transfusion/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Shared decision making'</a> below.)</p><p>A Witness or a family member of a Witness who receives a transfusion unwillingly may consider such transfusion a form of battery (rather than something affecting eternal salvation) and suffer the related emotional stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-the-patient-who-refuses-blood-transfusion/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. On the other hand, willing acceptance of a transfusion of blood products may result in the patient being cut off from a broad community of friends and family. In some cases, such rejection may influence the decision more than any personal belief regarding transfusion.</p><p>In the past, the practice of &quot;disfellowshipping&quot; was applied to unrepentant Witnesses who accepted blood transfusions. However, this policy has become less stringent, since in the act of accepting transfusion itself, patients have already dissociated themselves <strong>spiritually</strong> from God [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-the-patient-who-refuses-blood-transfusion/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Confidentiality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A Witness who receives a transfusion secretly (ie, without the knowledge of family members, friends, or other members of the church) will not be investigated or is unlikely to be discovered unless admitting the fact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-the-patient-who-refuses-blood-transfusion/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. As such, a patient may communicate a wish to receive transfusions privately. The clinician should take whatever steps are necessary to insure complete confidentiality concerning this point. Respect for patient confidentiality may require additional actions to ensure privacy from family, friends, and even hospital personnel not directly caring for the patient. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Maintaining patient rapport'</a> above.)</p><p>If possible, the clinician should confirm the treatment plan with the patient in private. One exception might be another member of the healthcare team with whom the patient feels comfortable, such as the patient's nurse. Some individuals may be willing to accept transfusion in extremis and this possibility should be thoroughly explored early during the patient's hospital stay, before the patient's hemoglobin declines to the point that thinking becomes clouded. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Contingency plans'</a> below.) </p><p>Another exception may be in the case where the patient refuses transfusion but the family desires it. In this case, it might be well for the patient to share his or her convictions with family members to lessen the pressure on the clinical team to transfuse against patient wishes. With the patient&rsquo;s permission, a family meeting with the clinical team may serve to avoid future discord, if the patient&rsquo;s life is threatened due to refusal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-the-patient-who-refuses-blood-transfusion/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">SHARED DECISION MAKING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people hold beliefs, such as refusal of blood transfusion, which they value more than their own lives.

An informed discussion with patients may relieve their concern regarding some of these products, such as certain immune globulins and albumin, which naturally cross the placenta between mother and fetus and are therefore accepted by many Witnesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-the-patient-who-refuses-blood-transfusion/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>There can be substantial variation among individual Witnesses. A chart review of obstetric patients found that among 61 self-identified Witnesses who had filled out an advanced health care directive, 39 percent would accept certain blood derivatives. An additional 10 percent indicated they would accept whole blood, suggesting that not all who identify themselves as Witnesses practice this particular belief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-the-patient-who-refuses-blood-transfusion/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Another study of 463 patients who self-identified as Witnesses found that more than 95 percent agreed to accept both cryoprecipitate and cryosupernatant following a comprehensive informed consent process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-the-patient-who-refuses-blood-transfusion/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. This emphasizes the importance of clarifying with the patient what they mean when they say that they &quot;do not want blood,&quot; in order to find out which blood fractions they are (or are not) willing to accept, and under what circumstances they will or will not accept them. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Contingency plans'</a> below.) </p><p>It is not uncommon to find patients who are not Witnesses who initially refuse transfusion out of respect for a family member who is a Witness. Most of these will accept blood in extremis. This reinforces the need for the clinician to have a frank discussion in private about the patient's religious commitment, treatment desires, and the possible outcome of those treatment choices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-the-patient-who-refuses-blood-transfusion/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

If this is the case, the clinician may need to consider referring nonemergent patients to another competent provider willing to care for the patient. In this instance, the patient is also under an obligation to respect the conscience of the healthcare provider.</p><p>There is significant emotional risk to a caregiver watching what may seem to be an easily preventable death. Those responsible for the patient should consider their own reactions to this possibility and transfer care if appropriate, or prepare to seek emotional support if necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-the-patient-who-refuses-blood-transfusion/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Special attention should be given to the nursing staff. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Effect on members of the treatment team'</a> below.)</p><p>Withdrawal from such a case does not constitute malpractice if the clinician arranges for transfer to another caregiver. The patient and family members, as well as the receiving clinician, should understand the reason for the transfer. Other caregivers that may be directly involved (eg, anesthesiologists, intensivists, nurses) should be aware of the patient's decision to refuse blood products, should be capable of providing the alternative care necessary, and should be willing to accept the possible consequences.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain interventions (eg, surgery, induction of labor, use of chemotherapy) may need to be performed sooner than expected due to the absence of a &quot;buffer&quot; of being able to transfuse red blood cells. It is important to discuss this with the patient. As an example, due to worries about uterine atony, some obstetricians might consider a cesarean section sooner in patients who have a poor &quot;labor curve&quot; or a poor response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a>. In addition, the threshold for performing a hysterectomy might be lower in the presence of life-threatening postpartum hemorrhage. Patients at risk should be advised of this possibility.

Nevertheless, in most countries the right of a competent adult to refuse consent for medical treatment is well accepted, and a number of legal cases have dealt specifically with Witnesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-the-patient-who-refuses-blood-transfusion/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Some settings deserve special attention, such as trauma, obstetrics, and pediatrics.

If there is any doubt in a clinician's mind concerning the wishes of a patient or what is legally appropriate, the prudent course in an emergency would be to treat according to the accepted standard of care. This would be without regard to special requests of parents on behalf of their children or relatives on behalf of incapacitated adults, until reliable legal documentation (as judged by the treating clinician) is available or the patient is stabilized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-the-patient-who-refuses-blood-transfusion/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p>Additional legal and ethical issues related to informed consent are discussed separately.

As minor children are not considered capable of informed consent, it is the duty of the clinician to seek legal intervention in cases where the child is placed at &quot;clear and substantial&quot; risk by parental decisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-the-patient-who-refuses-blood-transfusion/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Candid discussion about the clinician's obligation before the law may help parents understand that the clinician may have no alternative to transfusion in a life-threatening situation.</p><p>Whenever possible, adolescent children should be involved in the decision-making process. Situations may arise in which the adolescent may reject a transfusion that is acceptable to his or her guardians. In the United States, individual states have differing criteria for the age of majority (independent choice), and minor patients may be emancipated by the courts, or through such events as marriage or enlistment in the military.</p><p>In situations involving minors, prompt consultation with legal specialists is recommended to clarify the situation within the laws of a particular state, province, or country. Specific variations regarding pediatric transfusion and the competency of children have been published from Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-the-patient-who-refuses-blood-transfusion/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>], Great Britain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-the-patient-who-refuses-blood-transfusion/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>], and Canada [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-the-patient-who-refuses-blood-transfusion/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>In the event of a life-threatening situation that requires blood transfusion, a court order is <strong>not</strong> needed in order to transfuse a minor. In some settings, a court order allowing transfusion of a minor child is obtained in anticipation of a possible need. Although transfusing the child may be legally supportable, it does not mean that a transfusion <strong>must</strong> be given. Transfusing against the will of the parents <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> child will not be without psychological consequences.</p><p>The clinician should be straightforward with both the parents and child (if old enough) and explain the situation and intention to transfuse. Criteria that will be used to make the decision to transfuse should be clear, and guardians should feel that their objection is taken seriously and that transfusion will be a last resort. This will be helpful to the parents in understanding the legal reality faced when their conscience forbids consenting to a transfusion and a court order is sought.</p><p>In the case of an unborn fetus, it has been accepted in courts that the mother has control over her own body. This suggests that she can legally refuse transfusion of herself. However, when a mother&rsquo;s life will likely be lost unless transfused, leaving behind a healthy newborn, the father or a designated guardian should be available to care for the child. If no parent or guardian will be available to care for the newborn after the mother&rsquo;s death, the question has been raised as to whether the transfusion should be given in order to save the life of the infant's sole caregiver. This controversial possibility must be weighed carefully by the hospital ethics committee and in the court system, which differs greatly from state to state in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-the-patient-who-refuses-blood-transfusion/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p>The case of a pregnant woman carrying a fetus that needs transfusion before birth to save its life is also legally and ethically charged and should be approached in the same way.</p><p>If a court order becomes necessary, it should not be written in a way that classifies the parents as negligent and removes the child totally from parental custody. As an example, the judge can &quot;authorize&quot; the treatment requested by the clinician, avoiding the harsher term &quot;order&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-the-patient-who-refuses-blood-transfusion/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. If such treatment is <span class=\"nowrap\">authorized/ordered</span> by a judge, then the family is not going against church teaching by allowing transfusion, since the official position of the church on this point is that &quot;Christians agree with laws or court actions to prevent child abuse or neglect.&quot; Additional information on this difficult subject is available on the Official Web Site of Jehovah's Witnesses at <a href=\"http://www.jw.org/&amp;token=GPgc8tVAlmTf0IHXyn6AN0BmB6osUX7wQSugsGdZhv0=&amp;TOPIC_ID=7927\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.jw.org</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-the-patient-who-refuses-blood-transfusion/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Although the courts may overrule parental decision regarding transfusion, parents still have the legal right to be informed about their child's condition and the desire to be involved in other medical decisions. The clinician should remain sensitive to the possible feelings of guilt or distress that may be present in the young patient and family, despite a court order.

However, other family members who are not practicing Witnesses may have strong feelings about seeing a loved one die after refusing blood transfusion.</p><p>If family members or friends strongly disagree with the patient's decision to accept or refuse blood products, the clinician may be asked to provide additional explanation. In such cases, it may be wise to involve the medical center's ethics committee, legal department, and risk management group in order to balance the need between protecting confidentiality and providing effective communication of the treatment plan and its rationale. If the patient consents to a group meeting in order to discuss care with all of the concerned parties, this may have the best chance of diffusing the tension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-the-patient-who-refuses-blood-transfusion/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>The decision making process becomes complicated when the patient is incapacitated. Typically, a health care agent cannot override the patient&rsquo;s autonomy if it is known what the patient would have wanted in a given situation, and the information is documented. It is a question of the competing needs for autonomy of the patient with the beneficence of the medical team (and possibly the health care agent) wanting to preserve a life. Autonomy should be understood as simple competence, not rationality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-the-patient-who-refuses-blood-transfusion/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In the perfect world, a truly informed consent process would enable a clinician to know precisely what the patient would have wanted under any set of circumstances. Nevertheless, in the real world the clinician sometimes must determine if the consent was given under some sort of duress (even religious pressure might count), and whether the patient had a grasp of the gravity and scope of the decision made. Either of these might move the balance from autonomy toward beneficence, allowing the clinician to honor the request of the health care agent to transfuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-the-patient-who-refuses-blood-transfusion/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Contingency plans</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There should be a clear plan concerning what will occur under the worst-case scenario, namely the potential for death or morbidity (eg, stroke, myocardial infarction, renal failure) resulting from severe anemia or hypovolemic shock. Some patients may be willing to accept blood products when the clinician determines that death is likely without transfusion. In reluctant patients, it may sometimes be useful to suggest an arrangement where blood will not be given unless two independent clinicians agree that death is likely without transfusion. In the operative setting, the surgeon and anesthesiologist can fulfill this requirement.</p><p>The clinician must make it clear that the patient will die if bleeding cannot be stopped in a reasonable amount of time. This may require discussing options that would not be the clinician's first choice if the patient were willing to accept blood products. As an example, a contingency plan may state that a hysterectomy or colectomy might need to be performed, rather than let a patient bleed to death if the surgeon cannot achieve sufficient hemostasis. The patient needs to understand that eliminating the option of transfusion may make a clinician proceed more rapidly toward an intervention, such as cesarean section in a difficult labor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Documentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient's wishes should be documented in an advanced health care directive, and Witnesses are encouraged to carry it on their person.

The clinician may also have the patient sign the clinical note outlining the final agreement. The patient&rsquo;s family should typically be aware of the plan unless the patient feels that his or her decisions (eg, to accept blood in extremis) should remain strictly confidential.

A decision to use rhEPO must take into account the risk of thrombotic cardiovascular events that was demonstrated in patients with renal failure; chronic use of rhEPO is typically avoided to reduce this risk. Oral iron may be used in a preoperative setting when time permits; however, in the perioperative and ICU setting, IV iron allows for a greater rate of erythropoiesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-the-patient-who-refuses-blood-transfusion/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>].

Dealing with patients (and their families) who refuse blood transfusion takes an additional amount of time and energy, which may not be reimbursed. Nevertheless, clinicians are obliged to provide the best management possible consistent with the patient's values and preferences.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At a minimum, the following initial steps should be taken as soon as possible during the hospitalization:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Discuss the benefits and risks of blood transfusion so that the patient may be fully informed.

There should be a clear plan concerning what will occur under the worst-case scenario (eg, impending death or severe morbidity). Some patients may be willing to accept blood products at the point when the clinician determines that death is inevitable without transfusion.
