Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a biologically and clinically distinct variant of AML. APL was classified as AML-M3 in the older French-American-British (FAB) classification system and is currently classified as acute promyelocytic leukemia with t(15;17)(q24.1;q21.2);<em>PML-RARA</em> in the World Health Organization classification system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of acute myeloid leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>APL represents a medical emergency with a high rate of early mortality, often due to hemorrhage from a characteristic coagulopathy. It is critical to start treatment with a differentiation agent (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=all-trans-retinoic-acid-systemic-tretinoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">all-trans retinoic acid</a>) without delay as soon as the diagnosis is suspected based upon cytologic criteria, and even before definitive cytogenetic or molecular confirmation of the diagnosis has been made.</p><p>The clinical features, diagnosis, and prognosis of APL in adults will be reviewed here.

With respect to the incidence of APL among ethnic groups, contradictory data regarding a presumed higher incidence of APL in persons from Mexico, Central and South America, Italy, and Spain have been reported in the literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/2-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-7</a>]. In the United States, Hispanics were not found to have greater lifetime incidence rates of APL than Whites, although the incidence rates for APL were higher among Hispanic children and young adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Blacks had lower lifetime incidence rates than non-Hispanic Whites, Hispanics, and Asians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>]. Various studies have reported a modest increase in the incidence of APL in the last two decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>]. The cause for this increased incidence remains unknown.</p><p>The age distribution of patients with APL differs from other forms of AML. APL is uncommon in the first decade of life; its incidence increases during the second decade to reach a plateau during early adulthood, and then remains constant until it decreases after age 60 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Incidence does not vary by gender.</p><p>APL can sometimes occur after cytotoxic therapy for another disease (eg, breast cancer, lymphoma, other solid tumors), especially in association with the use of topoisomerase-II inhibitors such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, or after radiation therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. APL has been observed in patients with multiple sclerosis who have been treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitoxantrone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitoxantrone</a>, another topoisomerase II inhibitor. Therapy-related AML is presented separately.

Combinations of these symptoms are common. Unique to APL is a presentation with bleeding secondary to disseminated intravascular coagulation, which is discussed below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with APL, particularly the hypergranular variant, can have a low white cell count and only rare leukemic cells in the peripheral blood. Although APL is not usually a rapidly proliferative acute leukemia, by the time that patients present with symptoms, the situation has often become a life-threatening emergency because of the risk of catastrophic bleeding. How long APL is typically present in its preclinical phase is not known, but at diagnosis the marrow is often nearly 100 percent replaced by malignant promyelocytes, leading to severe anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. Only a small number of APL cells may be present in the blood. More importantly, this mass of malignant cells in the marrow provokes a severe coagulopathy with both disseminated intravascular thrombosis and primary fibrinolysis. The variant of APL characterized by microgranular APL cells does not bear any additional independent prognostic value, but tends to present with higher peripheral blast counts and perhaps more rapid proliferation.&nbsp;A white blood cell count <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;10,000/microL</span> (&gt;10 x 10<sup>9</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/L)</span> at diagnosis identifies a high-risk subset of APL, due in part to a higher early death rate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Coagulopathy and APL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Coagulopathy associated with APL is complex and involves both disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and primary hyperfibrinolysis and is either present at diagnosis or occurs soon after the initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This complication constitutes a medical emergency, because, if left untreated, it can cause pulmonary or cerebrovascular hemorrhage in up to 40 percent of patients and a 10 to 20 percent incidence of early hemorrhagic death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-16</a>]. Thrombotic complications are less common.

However, the following factors may be of primary importance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13</a>].

The rearranged <em>RARA</em> in APL activates the TF promoter and increases its expression in the leukemic cells resulting in a procoagulant state. TF expression can also be upregulated by cells undergoing apoptosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Death of APL cells by ETosis (a death pathway distinct from apoptosis and necrosis) releases extracellular chromatin and phosphatidylserine, which contribute to a hypercoagulable state by increasing thrombin generation and fibrin formation, damaging endothelial cells and converting them to a procoagulant phenotype, and increasing plasmin generation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary hyperfibrinolysis is a result of expression of annexin II, tissue and urokinase plasminogen activator as well as an acquired deficiency of alpha-2 antiplasmin and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. Annexin II expression is increased on the surface of the leukemic promyelocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Annexin II binds plasminogen and its activator, tissue plasminogen activator, increasing plasmin formation by a factor of 60.</p><p/><p>The induction of tumor cell differentiation with retinoic acid, plus appropriate supportive therapy, can lead to rapid improvement in the coagulopathy primarily by reducing the hypercoagulable state but with little effect on the hyperfibrinolytic pathway. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Control of coagulopathy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGIC FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Morphology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A significant number of patients will present with low white cell count at the time of diagnosis with only rare leukemic cells in the peripheral blood. In addition, the microgranular variant can be easily confused with myeloid leukemia with monocytic differentiation. A careful evaluation of the peripheral blood smear and recognition of the classic and variant morphology is therefore critical in making a presumptive diagnosis of APL before the <span class=\"nowrap\">molecular/cytogenetic</span> data become available. </p><p>APL is characterized by the presence of atypical promyelocytes in the bone marrow and peripheral blood. Promyelocytes are large (usually &gt;20 microns in diameter) myeloid precursors with variable morphology. Often there is a high nucleus to cytoplasmic ratio, fine chromatin, and prominent nucleoli. The cardinal feature of the promyelocyte is the presence of many violet granules in the cytoplasm with either a dense or coarse pattern, often obscuring the nucleus. The cells of APL differ morphologically from those of normal promyelocytes in that they are larger and typically have creased, folded, bilobed, kidney-shaped, or dumb-bell shaped nuclei (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F82863\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82863 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>There are two morphologic variants of APL: the hypergranular form and the microgranular form. Clinicians should be aware of these morphologic variants to allow for the identification of potential cases and the rapid initiation of treatment when the diagnosis is suspected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypergranular form</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hypergranular, or &quot;typical,&quot; form of APL is the most common variant, accounting for approximately 75 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. On Wright-stained smears, the cytoplasm of these promyelocytes typically contains densely-packed bright pink, reddish-blue or dark purple granules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F82863\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82863 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F82864\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82864 \">picture 2</a>). Neoplastic promyelocytes frequently contain Auer rods or occasionally bundles of Auer rods (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F82866\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82866 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F82865\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82865 \">picture 4</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Microgranular variant</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The microgranular (hypogranular) variant accounts for approximately 25 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The cells in this variant typically have a bilobed nucleus and no apparent granules on light microscopy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F82867\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82867 \">picture 5</a>). Primary granules are present, however, and are easily demonstrated using electron microscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The hypogranular promyelocytes can sometimes be mistakenly identified as being of monocytic origin. However, in contrast to monocytes, the myeloperoxidase reaction is strongly positive, and the non-specific esterase reaction is negative or only weakly positive.</p><p>In a typical case of APL, the malignant promyelocytes usually account for 30 percent or more of the myeloid cells in the bone marrow and are considered equivalent to blasts. Sometimes there are also increased blasts, but there are very few cells that mature past the promyelocyte stage of differentiation. The abnormal promyelocytes are usually intensely myeloperoxidase reaction positive. The non-specific esterase reaction is weakly positive in a quarter of cases but should not be construed as evidence of monocyte differentiation. Monocytes show bright non-specific esterase reactivity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunophenotype</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Typically, APL cells share certain immunophenotypic features with their normal promyelocytic counterparts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/5,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,19</a>]. The hypergranular variants have a high side scatter; express bright cytoplasmic myeloperoxidase, CD13 and CD33; are partial, weak, or negative for CD34; and do not express or only dimly express HLA-DR and CD11b. In contrast to normal promyelocytes, APL cells express abnormally low levels of CD15 and weak or variable CD117. </p><p>The hypogranular variant of APL shows a similar phenotype with a comparably bright myeloperoxidase expression and frequent coexpression of CD2, and can sometimes express CD34. Some cases can also show CD56, and this has been reported to be associated with worse prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Thus, with the caveats noted above, the APL phenotype is considered CD34 <span class=\"nowrap\">negative/partial</span> or weak positive, HLA-DR negative, CD13 positive, CD33 positive, CD11b negative, CD15 weak or negative, CD117 <span class=\"nowrap\">weak/variable,</span> and sometimes CD2 positive and CD56 positive.</p><p>Immunostaining with anti-PML monoclonal antibodies is a somewhat specific test that can be performed in as little as two to four hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. APL demonstrates a microspeckled nuclear staining pattern with nucleolar exclusion that differs from the discrete larger and fewer nuclear dots seen in normal cells and other forms of AML (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F82868\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82868 \">picture 6</a>). Sometimes, however, the staining pattern of non-APL cases can be difficult to interpret.</p><p>Furthermore, additional accompanying acquired mutations in particular genes such as <em>FLT3</em>-ITD (fms-like tyrosine kinase-internal tandem duplications) may be present as well although their prognostic significance for the time being is not certain and may differ by age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].

By chromosomal banding the translocation has been noted as t(15;17)(q22;q12), but based on the human genome sequence, the translocation is now believed to be more precisely written as t(15;17)(q24.1;q21.2). Rare cases of APL are associated with variant <span class=\"nowrap\">translocations/gene</span> rearrangements.

It is strongly recommended to start treatment with a differentiation agent (eg, tretinoin, also known as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=all-trans-retinoic-acid-systemic-tretinoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">all-trans retinoic acid</a> or ATRA) without delay as soon as the diagnosis is suspected based upon cytologic and clinical criteria, and before definitive genetic, cytogenetic, or immunostaining confirmation of the diagnosis has been made. If the diagnosis is not confirmed, ATRA can be discontinued and treatment changed to that used for other types of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of APL is suspected by the characteristic morphology of the leukemic cells, immunophenotype, or the presence of severe coagulopathy as described above. Another diagnostic clue is that the non-microgranular form of APL often presents with leukopenia. The diagnosis is confirmed by the identification of the <em>PML-RARA</em> fusion gene <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the associated chromosomal translocation (or one of the rare variants described above). While all available diagnostic tools should be utilized, a request for an expedited <span class=\"nowrap\">molecular/FISH</span> analysis looking for <em>PML-RARA</em> generally provides the fastest diagnostic result.

However, with modern therapy, APL is associated with the highest proportion of patients who are presumably cured of their disease. Despite the overall good prognosis for this group of patients, there is heterogeneity in this population. Patients younger than age 30 years and those who present with a white blood cell count less than <span class=\"nowrap\">10,000/microL</span> (10 x 10<sup>9</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/L)</span> have superior event-free survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].
