In the final weeks to months of life functional decline can impair the desire or ability to eat or drink; furthermore, dysphagia to solids and liquids is one of the most frequent symptoms that tends to worsen during the last days of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-definition-consequences-pathophysiology-and-etiology/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Swallowing dysfunction can impact the essence of pleasurable activities, compromise quality of life (eg, social interaction, communication), and impair nutrition and hydration. Swallowing disorders are also a major predisposing condition for aspiration, and can lead to several pulmonary syndromes, including pneumonia, and, in some cases, even asphyxiation or death.</p><p>Given the place of food and nutrition as a central focus of social interaction and the common concerns about adequate nutrition for well-being, swallowing disorders can also cause frustration and distress for families and caregivers. In addition, for many patients with a terminal illness, the inability to swallow <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> disinterest in food may represent a pivotal symptom that prompts the decision to consider end-of-life or hospice care. Management of patients with an advanced, life-threatening illness who are experiencing swallowing difficulty should focus on the following palliative care principles: the primary goals are prevention and relief of suffering with an emphasis on ensuring comfort, rather than optimal nutrition and hydration; the care plan should reflect the underlying life-threatening disease and be consistent with the overall goals of treatment; care is optimized by involving an interdisciplinary team whereby each specialist contributes <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> expert knowledge; and the patient and family are the unit of care and their wishes and preferences should guide collaborative decision making.</p><p>This topic review will cover the definitions, consequences, and etiology of swallowing disorders in patients receiving palliative care.

The dysphagia may be due to an obstructive or mechanical etiology (eg, a tumor or esophageal stricture) or may be caused by a motor or sensory dysfunction from a neurologic process. Dysphagia may cause problems with certain types of food or liquids in some patients, while others may not be able to swallow at all. Patients may complain of food getting caught along the upper digestive tract anywhere from the throat to the distal esophagus, cough or choke when eating or drinking, feel pain, or suffer from weight loss. It is important to note that in many cases, swallowing disorders may occur in the absence of symptomatic dysphagia. Silent aspiration may occur when the patient is unaware and there are no signs of struggle such as coughing. This phenomenon is especially common after treatment for head and neck cancer and in those with advanced multiple sclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-definition-consequences-pathophysiology-and-etiology/abstract/2-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-7</a>]. Swallowing problems may also manifest as a symptom such as cough, not necessarily voiced as a complaint related to difficulty swallowing.</p><p>Chronic swallowing problems affect the efficiency with which oral nourishment can be maintained which in turn can lead to generalized weakness, appetite loss, weight loss, dehydration, and malnutrition. In addition, airway protection or swallowing safety can also be threatened by swallowing disorders. Diversion of food or liquid into the trachea may occur, causing aspiration, choking, or in severe cases, asphyxiation. Several pulmonary syndromes may occur after aspiration, depending on the amount and nature of the aspirated material, the frequency of aspiration, and the host&rsquo;s response to the aspirated material (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F66505\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66505 \">table 1</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspiration pneumonia in adults&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aspiration pneumonia is an infectious process caused by the inhalation of oropharyngeal secretions that are colonized by pathogenic bacteria.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspiration pneumonia in adults&quot;</a>.).</p><p>The chronically ill patient with swallowing dysfunction may also suffer isolation from social interactions that take place around the consumption of food. Family members may refrain from eating around the patient, further isolating him or her [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-definition-consequences-pathophysiology-and-etiology/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Families, with all good intentions, often focus on food, given its central meaning in nurturing and beliefs about its importance in well-being. The focus of family interactions may shift from the patient&rsquo;s experience to the importance of food. The burden of caring for a dysphagic individual can add additional distress for a family member caring for a patient at the end of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-definition-consequences-pathophysiology-and-etiology/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Finally, for many patients with a terminal illness, the inability to swallow may represent a pivotal symptom that prompts the decision to consider end-of-life or hospice care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-definition-consequences-pathophysiology-and-etiology/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H105652902\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF SWALLOWING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H105652909\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal swallowing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Swallowing involves the passage of food or liquid from the oral cavity through the esophagus and into the stomach. Swallowing is an extremely complex physiologic act that demands exquisite timing and coordination of more than 30 pairs of muscles under voluntary and involuntary nervous control. Because humans swallow hundreds of times per day and are largely unaware of the activity, it is remarkable that difficulties do not occur more frequently. The cranial nerves (CN) involved in the swallowing process, and the clinical consequences of damage to the CNs are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F96249\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96249 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>For descriptive purposes, the act of swallowing is divided into three stages: the oral preparatory and transit stage, pharyngeal stage, and esophageal stage of swallowing. In reality these stages overlap and simultaneous, rather than discrete, actions occur in each stage. It takes one second for the bolus to leave the pharynx and enter the cervical esophagus and between 8 and 20 seconds for the bolus to enter the stomach with a more viscous bolus taking longer than liquids.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">Oral/Oral</span> preparatory phase</strong> &mdash; The oral stage is responsible for readying the bolus for swallowing. Bolus preparation is under voluntary control and can be halted or changed at any point. The oral cavity (chamber) extends from the lips anteriorly to the hard palate superiorly and the pharyngeal wall posteriorly; it is bounded inferiorly by the floor of the mouth and laterally by the buccal musculature. The ability of the oral cavity to fulfill its function as a closed chamber depends on the integrity of the many muscular contractions, which form valves that open and close, keeping the bolus in place or moving it around the mouth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F96486\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96486 \">figure 1</a>). The jaw must lower, the mouth must open, and the lips must close around the bolus to ingest the material into the oral cavity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-definition-consequences-pathophysiology-and-etiology/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The primary activities of mastication include gathering and placement of solid and liquid boluses on the tongue. It is during this stage that pleasure or displeasure is derived from the flavor, smell, and texture of food through the chemoreceptors of the tongue and palate. The tongue then moves the bolus to the dental arches to grind into smaller pieces, collects the bolus, and moves the smaller pieces to another surface for further grinding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The bolus is partitioned into a progressively smaller portion and moistened by enzyme-rich saliva which helps to bind the material together. Sensory receptors within the oral cavity assist in mediating saliva production as well as determining the chewing force and the configuration of the oral cavity to accommodate the bolus type and size. Contraction of the buccinator muscles keeps the bolus on the tongue dorsum. The tongue tip and lateral edges gather particles from the sulci of the cheek and the mouth floor, preventing food from falling out of the anterior oral cavity. The palatoglossus muscle contraction prevents premature spillage of the bolus into the pharynx before it is completely prepared for swallowing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-definition-consequences-pathophysiology-and-etiology/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Once the bolus is formed, it is positioned on the tongue and propelled posteriorly into the pharynx by contraction of the tongue and muscles of the floor of the mouth. The tongue acts as a piston to create pressure on the bolus and drive it into the pharynx [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-definition-consequences-pathophysiology-and-etiology/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The soft palate elevates to prevent nasal regurgitation and widen the pharyngeal lumen to accept the bolus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pharyngeal phase</strong> &mdash; The pharyngeal stage of swallowing is the most complex, requiring the most precise timing and coordination. During mastication of solids, lateral tongue movements disrupt the palatoglossal seal and the bolus moves in piecemeal fashion to the valleculae. With all boluses, the pharyngeal stage of the swallow begins as the posterior tongue retracts and descends, sending the bolus over the base of the tongue. The bolus passage stimulates sensory fibers of the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves to coordinate elevation and closure of the laryngeal inlet and opening of the esophagus. At this stage, the oral cavity and the pharynx become one continuous tube with the entrance to the larynx closed off to protect the airway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-definition-consequences-pathophysiology-and-etiology/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The pharynx elevates and shortens and progressive contractions of the pharyngeal constrictor muscles pass the bolus through the pharynx.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The process of airway protection (ie, closure of the larynx) is remarkable and intricate, demanding split second timing. There are multiple levels of closure, including epiglottic inversion over the entrance to the larynx, and sequential closure of the true and then the false vocal folds (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F96486\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96486 \">figure 1</a>). As the suprahyoid muscles of the floor of the mouth contract to propel the bolus from the oral cavity, the larynx moves upward and forward and the epiglottis inverts, closing the laryngeal vestibule. Respiration ceases momentarily as the airway closes and the bolus passes, an average of one second for a sip of liquid. The swallow occurs typically during the expiratory stage of the respiratory cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-definition-consequences-pathophysiology-and-etiology/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The expiratory flow of air further helps to prevent material from entering the larynx during the swallow.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The upper esophageal sphincter (UES), comprising the cricopharyngeus muscle, separates the pharynx from the esophagus. At rest it is tonically contracted, preventing air from entering the esophagus and esophageal contents from reentering the pharynx in a retrograde fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-definition-consequences-pathophysiology-and-etiology/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Opening of the UES creates a negative pressure in the esophagus, further helping to propel the bolus through the pharynx and toward the esophagus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-definition-consequences-pathophysiology-and-etiology/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The order of contraction of muscles during this complex series of events is invariable, but the timing and intensity of contraction depends on the viscosity and size of the bolus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-definition-consequences-pathophysiology-and-etiology/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The biomechanical events involved in this stage of swallowing are under involuntary control and are carefully sequenced in a pattern by the central pattern generator in the nuclei ambiguus and solitarius in the lower medulla. Sensory feedback modulates pharyngeal muscular function. If the sensory feedback loop is disturbed, the onset of the pharyngeal stage of swallowing may be delayed or, in severe cases, absent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-definition-consequences-pathophysiology-and-etiology/abstract/15,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,21,22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Esophageal phase</strong> The esophageal stage of swallowing involves transport of the bolus from the UES, through the lower esophageal segment (LES), and into the stomach, a distance of approximately 25 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-definition-consequences-pathophysiology-and-etiology/abstract/15,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,23</a>]. Like the pharyngeal phase of swallowing, the esophageal stage is under involuntary neuromuscular control, but the speed of propagation is slower (3 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/second</span> versus 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/second</span> in the pharynx) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-definition-consequences-pathophysiology-and-etiology/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The upper portion (cervical esophagus) consists of striated skeletal muscle which contract to produce the primary peristaltic wave.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The lower esophagus is comprised of smooth muscle fibers. The primary peristaltic wave carries the bolus through the LES in a series of relaxation-contraction waves. The LES remains open until the peristaltic wave passes. A secondary peristaltic wave, which is initiated by esophageal distention during the primary peristaltic wave, is generated at the point where striated muscle meets smooth muscle, and this clears the esophagus of residue. After passage of the bolus, UES and LES contract to their resting, closed state. This position prevents regurgitation of material into the hypopharynx and airway and contains the gastric contents within the stomach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-definition-consequences-pathophysiology-and-etiology/abstract/14,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H105652915\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathophysiology of dysphagia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Difficulty swallowing can occur during, within, or across any of the above-described stages, depending on the underlying disease or multitude of disease processes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oropharyngeal-dysphagia-etiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oropharyngeal dysphagia: Etiology and pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Examples include anatomic limitations following surgical resection and reconstruction in tongue or laryngeal cancer, obstructive esophageal mass, neurologically or medication induced sensory impairment, cognitive dysfunction in late-stage dementia, brainstem stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or general debility. Identification of the specific etiology and level of swallowing dysfunction is critical to determining the appropriate type of intervention and prognostication for improvement or decline.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30790691\"><span class=\"h3\">Oropharyngeal dysphagia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bolus formation and flow are adversely affected if there is dysfunction in the oral chamber or the piston-like tongue. Inefficient bolus flow may result from weakness in the tongue-driving force on the bolus, reduced contraction of the pharynx, or reduced excursion of the hyolaryngeal complex. Patients with muscle weakness or sensory dysfunction of the lips, tongue, and face may experience difficulty containing the bolus in the oral cavity, producing drooling or oral pocketing in the sides of the mouth, increasing the risk of aspiration. Patients who are not aware of food in their mouth may fail to close their lips or move the food around. Nasal regurgitation of liquids and particles of solids occurs when the velopharyngeal port is dysfunctional (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F96486\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96486 \">figure 1</a>). Weak tongue-driving force <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pharyngeal contraction during swallowing results in loss of control over the bolus, a significant amount of residue in the pharyngeal recesses, or incomplete laryngeal closure, causing aspiration before, during, or after the swallow especially when weakness co-exists in multiple structures. Failure of opening of the upper esophagus results in residue in the pyriform sinuses which may spill over into the unprotected larynx and trachea.</p><p>Valving of the larynx during the swallow is important for prevention of aspiration into the tracheobronchial tree (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F96486\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96486 \">figure 1</a>). Failure of the larynx to close due to timing or muscular incompetence can result in aspiration of liquids or solid materials. Reduced sensory function and weakened laryngeal or respiratory musculature can impair expectoration of aspirated material [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-definition-consequences-pathophysiology-and-etiology/abstract/22,23,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23,26</a>].</p><p>Xerostomia or hyposalivation causes oral dryness and is commonly experienced by up to 30 percent of patients receiving palliative care due to multiple causes including polypharmacy or dehydration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-definition-consequences-pathophysiology-and-etiology/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Saliva is necessary to breakdown food and formation of the bolus, and facilitates chewing and swallowing.

Ineffective esophageal bolus transit can occur when there is achalasia, loss of esophageal peristalsis, or esophageal spasm. Gastroesophageal reflux due to impaired LES contraction can result in retrograde flow of stomach contents back into the esophagus, sometimes reaching the level of the clavicle or worse, entering the airway. Patients with esophageal dysmotility typically report the sensation of food being stuck somewhere in the esophagus, pain, or discomfort swallowing solids; weight loss is frequent. However, patients who complain of solid food dysphagia or a globus sensation localized to the throat may present with distal esophageal dysfunction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-evaluation-of-dysphagia-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the evaluation of dysphagia in adults&quot;, section on 'Symptom-based differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H105652921\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY OF SWALLOWING DISORDERS IN PALLIATIVE CARE POPULATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A multitude of diseases can cause swallowing dysfunction in patients receiving palliative care, including progressive neuromuscular diseases, dementia and other neurodegenerative disorders, central nervous system tumors, recurrent or progressive neoplastic obstructive lesions of the gastrointestinal tract, or pervasive debilitation from multisystem diseases. In some cases, side effects of treatment such as radiation therapy or chemotherapy are the precipitating causative factors of dysphagia, whereas in others, the progressive nature of the disease leads to unsafe and inefficient swallowing.</p><p>Understanding the physiological impact of the illness is critical when evaluating the swallowing disorder and selecting an appropriate method of management. As an example, generalized weakness of the oropharyngeal musculature may be evident in a patient who carries a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and in another who has received chemoradiotherapy for a recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx metastatic to the neck. Both patients may experience a weak pharyngeal swallow with difficulty clearing the bolus through the pharynx, but the management approach might differ. In the patient with ALS, vigorous effortful swallows, or strengthening exercises would not be indicated due to muscle fatigue. On the other hand, in the patient with a neck neoplasm, encouraging effortful swallows to preserve motor flexibility may improve airway protection to enable some oral intake of food.</p><p>Some of the commonly encountered causes of swallowing disorders in palliative care are discussed in detail below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H105652927\"><span class=\"h2\">Neoplasms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tumors involving the central nervous system, head and neck, and the upper aerodigestive tract can interfere with swallowing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12411622\"><span class=\"h3\">Head and neck cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oropharyngeal dysphagia is ubiquitous in patients with advanced-stage head and neck cancer.

Dysphagia may occur as a long-term complication of treatment. Tumors occurring in a variety of sites in the oral cavity and tongue, pharynx, larynx, and upper (cervical) esophagus can affect the nerve supply and muscle coordination, as well as the strength of movements involved in swallowing.</p><p>Surgical resection involving the swallow mechanism, including reconstructive surgery, can be disfiguring and can lead to profound functional morbidity of speech and swallow.

As the disease progresses, involvement of the upper and lower motor neurons affects speaking, swallowing, walking, writing, and ultimately the respiratory system. The usual cause of death in patients with ALS is due to weakness in diaphragmatic, laryngeal, and lingual function with aspiration a precipitating factor. A multidisciplinary team approach is critical in caring for these patients, as their life expectancy is typically between three to five years after diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-definition-consequences-pathophysiology-and-etiology/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>].

Oropharyngeal weakness also causes drooling of saliva that is not completely swallowed. There is progressive difficulty chewing and control of food and liquid boluses in the mouth. Patients may experience nasal regurgitation of fluids and loss of tongue control over liquids which spill into the airway too quickly, causing aspiration and coughing before the swallow is triggered. As the disease progresses, dense foods (even pureed) are difficult to manipulate, resulting in significant post-swallow residue in the oral cavity. Diminished pharyngeal drive in combination with tongue weakness also results in residue in the pharynx. Diet modifications with calorie-dense foods and postural alterations are necessary if oral intake is to continue.

Depending on the overall goals of care expressed by the patient and family, a gastrostomy feeding tube can be placed percutaneously (PEG) or via interventional radiology to provide nutrition and hydration. Sometimes a hybrid arrangement with nutritional formula for primary nutrition and supplemental oral intake for pleasure is possible. Early placement of a PEG tube may prolong survival, reduce complications, and improve quality of life in some ALS patients.

Dysphagia in PD may be caused by difficulties in the oral, pharyngeal, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> esophageal phases of the swallow and is related to changes in striated muscles that are under dopaminergic control, and in smooth muscles that are under autonomic control. Difficulties with the oral stage are caused by rigidity of the lingual musculature rather than weakness. Small-amplitude, ineffective tongue-rolling movements are observed as patients attempt to propel the boluses into the pharynx. As a result, pharyngeal swallow responses are delayed, with aspiration occurring both before and during the swallow. Expectoration of cough-aspirated material is weak because of rigidity of the laryngeal musculature. In addition, there may be incomplete relaxation of the upper esophageal sphincter and esophageal dysmotility during swallowing, which also contributes to dysphagia. Even mild swallowing impairments may cause changes in quality of life for patients with PD and their caregivers and often adds to their perceived burden and worries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-definition-consequences-pathophysiology-and-etiology/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

There is a &ge;3-fold increase in pneumonia risk among stroke patients who present with dysphagia. Long standing inability to feed a patient orally after a stroke may be closely linked to the provision and timing of end of life care, as decisions surrounding placement of a gastrostomy tube may herald the need for end of life care decisions. The incidence, severity, and prognosis of dysphagia are greatly affected by the locus of neurologic damage, age, recurrence of strokes, premorbid functional status, and the interplay of multiple chronic illnesses. Although many stroke patients recover swallowing abilities, those with the most devastating damage may never fully recover a level of consciousness or motor control to safely or efficiently maintain oral nourishment. Dysphagia after stroke is quite varied and can be due to reduced lingual control, an <span class=\"nowrap\">absent/delayed</span> swallowing reflex, and weakened laryngopharyngeal musculature. In general, anterior and subcortical strokes result in the highest rates of dysphagia, while patients with brainstem strokes typically cause the most severe dysphagia affecting all phases of swallowing, particularly if the medulla is affected.

Dysphagia is often encountered within the hospital or long-term care setting (eg, nursing home) in which patients may have complex medical issues resulting in cachexia, loss of muscle mass, or significantly compromised pulmonary systems that impede airway protection. Depression and loss of appetite can co-occur and impact overall oral nourishment. These patients are at much higher risk for pulmonary infections and poor outcomes should they aspirate. Difficulty in completing oral care due to a low level of consciousness <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> presence of an endotracheal tube can promote colonization of oral bacteria in the hospitalized patient. Aspiration of colonized oropharyngeal contents (secretions, vomitus, <span class=\"nowrap\">food/liquid</span> mixed with colonized secretions) is a major contributor to aspiration pneumonia.
