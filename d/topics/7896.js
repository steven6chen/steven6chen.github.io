Subsequent publications attributed these pains to &quot;rheumatism,&quot; a word synonymous with rheumatic fever at the time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growing-pains/abstract/2-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-7</a>]. Correlations were described with digestive and sleep disorders, loose joints, poor posture, and chronic infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growing-pains/abstract/3,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8,9</a>]. By the 1930s and 1940s, growing pains were distinguished from rheumatic fever and other pathologic conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growing-pains/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. This distinction remains the focus of the evaluation of children with recurrent limb pain.</p><p>Growing pains are benign and usually resolve within a year or two of onset. They must be distinguished from pathologic causes of pain that require additional therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59384\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59384 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The epidemiology, etiology, clinical features, evaluation, and management of growing pains in children are reviewed here. The evaluation of children with joint pain and limp is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-a-limp\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with a limp&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-child-with-joint-pain-and-or-swelling\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the child with joint pain and/or swelling&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no consensus definition of growing pains, and, as a result, there are no specific inclusion or exclusion criteria that are uniformly applied to studies of children with complaints of growing pains. The key consideration is that clinicians not dismiss as &quot;growing pains&quot; a significant problem for which intervention may be appropriate.</p><p>In this regard, it is best to restrict &quot;growing pains&quot; to the description of children with pain awakening them at night (or from naps) who are otherwise without any manifestation of musculoskeletal problems. In contrast, children with unexplained joint pains that occur in association with activity deserve further investigation, which the child with typical &quot;growing pains&quot; may not.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Growing pains usually begin between 2 and 12 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growing-pains/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The prevalence varies from 4 to 37 percent depending upon the population studied, the age of the children, and the clinical definition used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growing-pains/abstract/2,11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,11-14</a>]. However, surveys of schoolchildren indicate that as many as 10 to 20 percent have had growing pains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growing-pains/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. Growing pains are slightly more common among girls than boys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growing-pains/abstract/11-13,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13,18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology of growing pains is not known. Although they occur in growing children, they are not actually caused by growth. Growing pains do not coincide with periods of rapid growth, do not occur at the sites of growth, and do not affect the growth of children who have them [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growing-pains/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Emotional disturbance and psychogenic illness often are mentioned as possible causes, but have not been studied systematically.</p><p>Several other etiologies have been proposed, including fatigue, mild orthopedic and postural abnormalities, restless leg syndrome, and local overuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growing-pains/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. Parents of children with growing pains often reveal a pattern of increased complaints following an increased level of physical activity. A study of bone speed of sound (SOS) measured by quantitative ultrasonography provides support for local overuse as a contributing factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growing-pains/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In this study, children with growing pains had decreased SOS compared with control children. Decreased SOS is also seen in patients with local overuse.</p><p>In population-based studies, growing pains are consistently associated with other recurrent pains (eg, headache and abdominal pain) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growing-pains/abstract/13,18,24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,18,24-26</a>]. In one study, children with recurrent headache (45 percent of whom also had growing pains) were more often described by their parents as having greater sensitivity to pain, greater reaction to stressful situations, and more depressive symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growing-pains/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In another study, children with growing pains were found to have a decreased pain threshold compared with control children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growing-pains/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tension-type-headache-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tension-type headache in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic abdominal pain in children and adolescents: Approach to the evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features of growing pains have been described in several studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growing-pains/abstract/11-13,18,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13,18,28</a>].

When parents seem particularly concerned and difficult to reassure, thorough diagnostic evaluation is an effective way to both exclude a significant underlying problem and provide the necessary reassurance. However, the evaluation must be clinically appropriate since there is potentially no limit to the concerns that families may express or the studies they may request.

Education of the patient and family is a crucial component of the management plan.

Often, episodes that awaken the child at night cluster in groups of nights and follow days of increased physical activity. In a child who has been appropriately evaluated, acetaminophen or ibuprofen given at bedtime may prevent awakening following a day of increased activities or break the cycle of repeated complaints. At times, a longer-acting analgesic given after dinner, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">naproxen</a>, may be needed for the child to be able to sleep through the night.
