Twenty-two isolates (88 percent) were of vaccine-specific serotypes (15 versus 7 events in the vaccine arm versus the placebo arm, respectively; HR 2.1; 95% CI 0.9-5.2).

There are no trials comparing the efficacy of polysaccharide vaccines and conjugate vaccines in HIV-infected patients.</p><p>In one double-blind clinical trial conducted in Malawi, the efficacy of pneumococcal immunization for secondary prevention was evaluated among 496 patients who had been hospitalized with documented invasive pneumococcal disease; 88 percent also had underlying HIV infection, but only 13 percent of the HIV-infected patients were taking ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-immunization-in-hiv-infected-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In the intervention arm, two doses of PCV7 were administered four weeks apart, starting one week after hospital discharge. The primary endpoint was an episode of pneumococcal disease caused by one of the vaccine serotypes; furthermore, disease related to serotype 6A was also included, based on data showing a cross-protective effect of the vaccine. Over a median follow-up of approximately 14 months, the following results were demonstrated:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lower number of episodes of pneumococcal disease (caused by vaccine serotypes or the 6A serotype), occurred in the vaccine group compared with the placebo group (5 versus 19, respectively) for an estimated overall vaccine efficacy of 74 percent among HIV-infected patients (95% CI, 30-90 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaccine efficacy, estimated at 85 percent in the first year, declined to 25 percent in the second year, despite an increase in the number of HIV patients receiving ART as the trial progressed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There was no significant difference in all-cause mortality or mortality associated with pneumococcal disease between the intervention and placebo groups. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HIV RNA levels were not measured after immunization to address possible upregulation of HIV infection.</p><p/><p>In a second clinical trial, 212 HIV-infected French patients with CD4 cell counts of 200 to 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> and plasma HIV RNA &lt;50,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> were randomly assigned to receive either PCV7 followed by a boost with 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) four weeks later or PPSV23 alone at week four [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-immunization-in-hiv-infected-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The proportion of immunologic responders to pneumococcal serotypes, shared by both vaccines, was examined. Those patients in the &ldquo;prime-boost&rdquo; strategy arm had a greater frequency and breadth of serologic responses to Streptococcal pneumoniae polysaccharide antigens at eight weeks than patients who received PPSV alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-immunization-in-hiv-infected-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Early differences in IgG titers persisted at 24 weeks of follow-up with this prime-boost strategy.

However, there are promising data regarding a prime-boost effect of PCV7 followed by PPSV23 on inducing and maintaining protective immunity. In addition, the Malawi trial suggests efficacy of PCV7 in reducing pneumococcal disease, although efficacy declined over time in this mainly untreated HIV-infected patient population with advanced immunosuppression. One note of caution is that serotypes causing invasive pneumococcal disease vary by many factors including geographical location. After introduction of PCV7 in the UK (but not in the US), there was an increase in non-PCV vaccine serotypes causing invasive disease in nonvaccinated individuals over 2 years old. Since 2010 when PCV13 was introduced in the UK, there has thus far not been an increase in non-PCV13 vaccine serotypes causing invasive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-immunization-in-hiv-infected-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p>ART is likely to be of equal importance to immunization in protection against pneumococcal disease through the preservation of immune function and subsequent protection against encapsulated organisms.</p><p>Preliminary data suggest that the use of adjuvants may be a promising tool to help improve overall vaccine immunogenicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-immunization-in-hiv-infected-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H273895\"><span class=\"h1\">VACCINE RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The recommendations by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for the HIV-infected patient are influenced by clinical trial data on vaccine efficacy and immunogenicity in HIV-uninfected adults. </p><p>In December 2011, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) for use in adults &ge;50 years of age based upon safety and immunogenicity data in more than 6000 HIV-uninfected adults; these data showed that PCV13 induced antibody responses that were either comparable to or higher than the responses induced by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumococcal-polysaccharide-vaccine-23-valent-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine</a> (PPSV23) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-immunization-in-hiv-infected-adults/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H11160230\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology of pneumococcal disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Available pneumococcal vaccine formulations include the 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (ie, PPSV23) and the 13-valent conjugate vaccine (ie, PCV13), which has replaced the 7-valent conjugate vaccine. The PCV13 vaccine affords protection against additional serotypes of pneumococcus that cause invasive disease. (See <a href=\"#H273655\" class=\"local\">'Available vaccine formulations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pneumococcal immunization has been advised for HIV-infected patients in developed countries since the mid-1990s, based on the high incidence of invasive disease in this patient population. A systematic review of mainly observational data suggests moderate efficacy of pneumococcal vaccine among HIV-infected patients. Immunogenicity is lower among HIV-infected patients compared to healthy subjects, although HIV-infected patients taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) achieve higher vaccine-specific antibody titers than those who are not taking ART. Combination ART also decreases overall mortality. (See <a href=\"#H11160237\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy and immunogenicity of pneumococcal vaccination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no trials comparing the efficacy of polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) to conjugate vaccine in HIV-infected patients. Although there are no clinical data on the use of 13-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV13), two prior clinical trials of the earlier 7-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV7) demonstrated significant efficacy and immunogenicity with reduction of pneumococcal disease among HIV-infected adults in resource-limited settings. One of these trials also demonstrated a &ldquo;prime-boost effect&rdquo; of PCV7 followed by PPSV23 on inducing and maintaining protective immunity. (See <a href=\"#H11160237\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy and immunogenicity of pneumococcal vaccination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend pneumococcal immunization in HIV-infected adults (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). We prefer to administer the 13-valent conjugate vaccine based on efficacy and immunogenicity data with a related 7-valent conjugate vaccine among HIV-infected patients. The 13-valent conjugate vaccine has the advantage of covering additional pneumococcal serotypes that cause invasive disease. (See <a href=\"#H273895\" class=\"local\">'Vaccine recommendations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The dosing schedule of pneumococcal vaccine depends on the patient&rsquo;s immunization history. For patients who previously received one of more doses of polysaccharide vaccine, the 13-valent vaccine should be given one or more years later. Patients who have not been previously immunized against pneumococcal disease should receive a single dose of the 13-valent conjugate vaccine followed by a dose of polysaccharide vaccine at least eight weeks later (ie, a &ldquo;prime-boost&rdquo; strategy). (See <a href=\"#H273914\" class=\"local\">'Vaccine administration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The 13-valent vaccine should be administered regardless of the CD4 cell count. The polysaccharide vaccine is more likely to be immunogenic when administered at a CD4 cell count greater than 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span>. (See <a href=\"#H11160265\" class=\"local\">'When to immunize'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pneumocystis prophylaxis with agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> also decreases the risk of developing pneumococcal disease. (See <a href=\"#H87043721\" class=\"local\">'Role of prophylaxis against pneumocystis and pneumococcal disease'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-immunization-in-hiv-infected-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Redd SC, Rutherford GW 3rd, Sande MA, et al.
