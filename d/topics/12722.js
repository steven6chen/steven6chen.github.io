The gynecological history and physical examination and techniques for obtaining cultures in these children are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gynecologic-examination-of-the-newborn-and-child\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gynecologic examination of the newborn and child&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3774186238\"><span class=\"h1\">BACKGROUND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vulvovaginal complaints in prepubertal children may be the result of infection, congenital abnormalities, trauma, or dermatologic conditions. Vaginitis may have a nonspecific etiology or may be due to known pathogens. It is the commonest gynecological problem in prepubertal girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vulvovaginal-complaints-in-the-prepubertal-child/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Symptoms include vaginal discharge, erythema, soreness, pruritus, dysuria, and bleeding. Occasionally, urinary tract or bowel symptoms may be interpreted by a child as vulvar or vaginal complaints.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NONSPECIFIC VULVOVAGINITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonspecific vulvovaginitis is responsible for 25 to 75 percent of vulvovaginitis in prepubertal girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vulvovaginal-complaints-in-the-prepubertal-child/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. There are a number of potential factors in children that increase their risk of vulvovaginitis: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of labial development </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unestrogenized thin mucosa </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More alkaline pH (pH 7) than postmenarchal <span class=\"nowrap\">girls/women</span> </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poor hygiene, </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bubble baths, shampoos, deodorant soaps, or other irritants</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obesity </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Foreign bodies </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Choice of clothing (leotards, tights, and blue jeans)</p><p/><p>Chronic masturbatory activity can lead to vulvar irritation with occasional thickening of the clitoral hood. Sexual abuse is another etiology of nonspecific vulvovaginitis. Some girls with nonspecific vulvovaginitis seem to experience recurrences at the time of upper respiratory infections.</p><p>The following recommendation for parents may be of help:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid sleeper pajamas. Nightgowns allow air to circulate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cotton underpants. Double-rinse underwear after washing to avoid residual irritants. Do not use fabric softeners for underwear and swimsuits.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid tights, leotards, and leggings. Skirts and loose-fitting pants allow air to circulate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Daily warm bathing is helpful as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Allow the child to soak in clean water (no soap) for 10 to 15 minutes. Adding vinegar or baking soda to the water has not been specifically studied but from our experience is not more efficacious than clean water alone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Use soap to wash regions other than the genital area just before taking the child out of the tub. Limit use of any soap on genital areas.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Rinse the genital area well and gently pat dry.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A hair dryer on the cool setting may be helpful to assist with drying the genital region.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not use bubble baths or perfumed soaps.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the vulvar area is tender or swollen, cool compresses may relieve the discomfort. Wet wipes can be used instead of toilet paper for wiping. Emollients may help protect skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Review hygiene with the child. Emphasize wiping front-to-back after bowel movements. Have her sit with knees apart to reduce reflux of urine into the vagina. If she has trouble with this position because of small size, she can use a smaller detachable seat or sit backwards on the toilet (facing the toilet). Children younger than five should be supervised or assisted in toilet hygiene.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid letting children sit in wet swimsuits for long periods of time after swimming.</p><p/><p>These techniques usually result in resolution of nonspecific mucoid discharge <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> odor within two to three weeks. If symptoms persist or recur, the possibility of a foreign body or specific infection should be considered. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Foreign body'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Specific infections'</a> below.)</p><p>Although not indicated for most nonspecific vaginal discharge, which resolves with the measures above, antibiotic therapy may hasten the resolution of a purulent vaginal discharge (despite a negative culture for specific infections, such as group A streptococcus) that does not respond to hygiene measures and for which other diagnoses have been excluded. Alternative regimens include: a 10-day course of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">amoxicillin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-and-clavulanate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">amoxicillin-clavulanate</a>; topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">metronidazole</a>; or topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">clindamycin</a>.</p><p>Occasionally, a short course of estrogen-containing cream (eg, Premarin) can thicken the vaginal mucosa and make it more resistant to recurrent nonspecific infections. Again, making sure to exclude the conditions described below is important.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIFIC INFECTIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Pinworm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pinworms can cause vulvar symptoms, such as itching. Children with recurrent episodes of vulvar <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> perianal itching, especially at night, should be examined for pinworms and treated empirically, if indicated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enterobiasis-pinworm-and-trichuriasis-whipworm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Enterobiasis (pinworm) and trichuriasis (whipworm)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Respiratory and enteric flora</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children may pass respiratory flora from the nose and oral pharynx to the vulvar area. Respiratory pathogens include: <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em> (group A <em>Streptococcus)</em>, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em>, and <em>Moraxella catarrhalis</em>. Likewise, enteric pathogens, such as <em>Shigella</em> and <em>Yersinia</em>, may cause vaginitis. <em>S. pyogenes</em> is the most commonly identified pathogen in prepubertal girls. Depending upon the definition of vulvovaginitis (vulvitis versus vaginitis only), the prior use of antibiotics, the type of culture obtained (vaginal versus introital), and the clinic setting, typically about 20 percent of girls with vulvovaginitis have <em>S. pyogenes</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vulvovaginal-complaints-in-the-prepubertal-child/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>].</p><p>Vaginal cultures for respiratory and enteric flora should be obtained if vulvovaginitis persists or the discharge is purulent. Antimicrobial therapy for vulvovaginitis caused by respiratory or enteric bacteria depends upon the organism. Group A <em>Streptococcus</em> is treated with penicillin or a similar antibiotic. <em>S. aureus</em>, <em>H. influenzae</em>, and other respiratory flora often resolve with hygiene measures alone but should be treated if vulvovaginitis is persistent or purulent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Candida</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Colonization with Candida occurs in 3 to 4 percent of prepubertal girls. Candidal infection is most common in children who have had recent antibiotic therapy, are immunosuppressed, or who wear diapers. It is uncommon in normal prepubertal girls, in whom it is frequently overdiagnosed and wrongly assumed to be the etiology for patients' symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=candida-vulvovaginitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Candida vulvovaginitis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diaper-dermatitis#H33452433\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diaper dermatitis&quot;, section on 'Secondary infection'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diaper-dermatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diaper dermatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Gardnerella vaginalis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Gardnerella vaginalis</em> is generally not associated with a vaginal discharge in prepubertal girls. A possible relationship with sexual abuse has been disputed. In one study, <em>Gardnerella</em> was identified in 14.6 percent of sexually abused girls compared with only 4.2 percent of control girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vulvovaginal-complaints-in-the-prepubertal-child/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In another report, however, the incidence of <em>Gardnerella</em> was equivalent in sexually abused girls and the female children of friends of the author (controls) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vulvovaginal-complaints-in-the-prepubertal-child/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Sexually transmitted diseases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sexually transmitted diseases in children typically result from sexual abuse. Pathogens include <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em>, <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em>, human papillomavirus, <em>Treponema pallidum</em>, and herpes simplex virus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of sexual abuse in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Sexually transmitted infection testing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Neisseria gonorrhoeae</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> usually presents with a green or mucoid vaginal discharge; the infection is rarely asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vulvovaginal-complaints-in-the-prepubertal-child/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] but occasionally may be found without symptoms in girls being evaluated for sexual abuse. The diagnosis is made by culturing girls with an evident discharge. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gynecologic-examination-of-the-newborn-and-child#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gynecologic examination of the newborn and child&quot;, section on 'How to obtain cultures and other specimens from children'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection in adults and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of sexual abuse in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Prepubertal victims'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Chlamydia trachomatis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> is primarily transmitted to newborns via exposure to an infected mother's genital flora during vaginal birth and may persist for months to several years unless treated with antibiotics (often for another reason). Newborns are less likely to acquire Chlamydia at birth than in the past because of the increased screening and treatment of pregnant women. <em>C. trachomatis</em> is also associated with vaginitis and sexual abuse, although patients may be asymptomatic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlamydia-trachomatis-infections-in-the-newborn#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chlamydia trachomatis infections in the newborn&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology and transmission'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of sexual abuse in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Prepubertal victims'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Trichomonas vaginalis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Trichomonas vaginalis</em> can occur in newborns, but is rare in the prepubertal child. Thus, except for infants, sexual contact is likely if trichomonal organisms are identified (by an experienced technician or clinician) in vaginal secretions by wet mount examination, culture, or nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) which is the most sensitive and specific test. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of sexual abuse in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Sexually transmitted infections'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trichomoniasis#H58793405\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trichomoniasis&quot;, section on 'Nucleic acid amplification test'</a>.) </p><p>Evidence is limited regarding the performance of NAAT for trichomoniasis in children but no data indicates that detection of T. vaginalis would be markedly different from adults as long as an adequate sample is collected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vulvovaginal-complaints-in-the-prepubertal-child/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Condylomata acuminata</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Condylomata acuminata are skin-colored or pink lesions that may be warty or smooth flattened papules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F110969\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef110969 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F111036\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111036 \">picture 2</a>). They are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). In children younger than two to three years of age, these lesions are likely the result of maternal-child transmission during vaginal birth but may be acquired by sexual or nonsexual transmission. It is not necessary for the mother to be symptomatic or to have a history of HPV for this transmission to occur. HPV testing of mothers does not exclude sexual abuse and therefore is not generally performed; if sexual abuse is of concern, evaluation is needed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of sexual abuse in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Sexually transmitted infections'</a>.)</p><p>In older children, sexual transmission and evaluation for potential sexual abuse should be considered and if there is a concern, children should be interviewed and evaluated by appropriately experienced professionals. Auto- and hetero-inoculation and indirect transmission via fomites are other possibilities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of sexual abuse in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Sexually transmitted infections'</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis is usually made clinically and treated without a biopsy. A biopsy can, however, confirm the presence of HPV and leads to a conclusive diagnosis. HPV DNA typing may help the health care provider formulate a follow-up surveillance plan (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76394\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76394 \">table 1</a>). There are over 100 distinct HPV subtypes; approximately 40 types are specific for the anogenital epithelium and have varying potentials to cause malignant change, such as cervical or anal cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76394\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76394 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=virology-of-human-papillomavirus-infections-and-the-link-to-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Virology of human papillomavirus infections and the link to cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Spontaneous resolution occurs within five years in more than 50 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vulvovaginal-complaints-in-the-prepubertal-child/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Expectant management is a potential initial approach to asymptomatic pediatric condylomata; however, many families choose to have them treated. Treatment options have not been well studied and have included laser therapy (which requires anesthesia), trichloroacetic acetic (which is not well tolerated in this age group), and topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiquimod-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imiquimod</a> cream (which needs careful monitoring to assure vulvar reactions are not severe). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=condylomata-acuminata-anogenital-warts-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Condylomata acuminata (anogenital warts) in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">FOREIGN BODY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Foreign bodies in children can cause acute and chronic recurrent vulvovaginitis. Chronic vaginal discharge, intermittent bleeding or spotting, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a foul smelling odor are the usual clinical manifestations. Toilet paper is the most common foreign body found in the vaginas of children; small toys, hair bands, and paper clips are also common.</p><p>The foreign body can often be removed by a calgi swab (for toilet paper) or with irrigation with warmed fluid, after the introitus has been treated with a topical anesthetic agent, such as a small amount of Xylocaine jelly. Examination under sedation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anesthesia may be necessary for extraction of larger foreign bodies and those that cannot be removed with irrigation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">POLYPS, SKIN TAGS, OR TUMORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A vaginal polyp or tumor may also present with chronic discharge. Benign polyps may involve the vagina and hymenal area but are rare. Hymenal &quot;skin tags&quot; can be confused as a polyp and are also benign. Sarcoma botryoides is a malignancy that can involve the hymen, lower urethra, or anterior vaginal wall. The peak incidence is at age two to five years. The tumor is more likely to arise higher up along the anterior vaginal wall towards the cervix in older preadolescent girls. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rhabdomyosarcoma in childhood and adolescence: Epidemiology, pathology, and molecular pathogenesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-cancer#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vaginal cancer&quot;, section on 'Sarcoma'</a>.)</p><p>Treatment is surgical; the specific procedure depends upon the pathology. A simple polyp can be removed with surgical excision. A skin tag of the hymen can remain in place and be removed only if it is changing in size or causing an issue (pain from pulling of the skin tag with wiping or later insertion of a tampon). A vaginal sarcoma requires biopsy for diagnosis and then chemotherapy and conservative surgery with the aim to treat the tumor while maintaining future sexual and reproductive function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-cancer#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vaginal cancer&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">SYSTEMIC ILLNESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measles, chickenpox, scarlet fever, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV, infectious mononucleosis) Stevens-Johnson syndrome, Crohn's disease, and Kawasaki disease have all been associated with vulvovaginal signs and symptoms, such as vesicles, discharge, fistulae, ulcers, and inflammation. Severe cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome or graft-versus-host disease after bone marrow transplant may result in vaginal stenosis or obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vulvovaginal-complaints-in-the-prepubertal-child/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stevens-johnson-syndrome-and-toxic-epidermal-necrolysis-management-prognosis-and-long-term-sequelae#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: Management, prognosis, and long-term sequelae&quot;, section on 'Long-term sequelae'</a>.)</p><p>Persistent complaints of vaginal bleeding or discharge that are otherwise unexplained may be a manifestation of a serious underlying medical problem (eg, rhabdomyosarcoma or other tumor) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vulvovaginal-complaints-in-the-prepubertal-child/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Pelvic examination under anesthesia, vaginoscopy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cystoscopy may be necessary if genital examination and noninvasive imaging fail to provide an explanation for such complaints.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">VULVAR ULCERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonsexually transmitted vulvar ulcers, sometimes called Lipschutz ulcers, &quot;virginal ulcers&quot;, or &quot;aphthous ulcers&quot;, are typically seen in girls age 10 to 15 years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68284\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68284 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vulvovaginal-complaints-in-the-prepubertal-child/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Clinical features may include one or more acutely painful ulcers (often &gt;1 cm) with a purulent base and raised edges and often systemic symptoms (eg, fatigue, malaise, fever, headache).</p><p>The etiology often cannot be determined, although viral infections such as influenza A, EBV, and CMV have been associated with these painful lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vulvovaginal-complaints-in-the-prepubertal-child/abstract/15-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-20</a>]. A careful sexual history should be taken and testing for STDs, such as herpes simplex, performed even though in most cases the ulcers occur before the onset of genital or oral sexual activity. A CBC, differential, and monospot test, as well as acute and convalescent serum, can be obtained to look for EBV.</p><p>Although most girls can be treated at home, at times patients require admission for Foley catheter drainage due to the inability to urinate, antibiotics (if the ulcers are superinfected), topical anesthetics, and pain management. Oral corticosteroids have also been prescribed for these ulcers, but controlled studies are lacking. These ulcers often heal completely in one to three weeks, but may recur. </p><p>Persistent ulcers can occur in girls with Crohn's disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Crohn disease in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Recurrent vulvar ulcers, especially if associated with evidence of systemic involvement and vasculitis (oral lesions, uveitis, arthritis) should suggest the possibility of Beh&ccedil;et&rsquo;s syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Beh&ccedil;et syndrome&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">URINARY TRACT PATHOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Ectopic ureter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An ectopic ureter can cause chronic vulvar irritation and wetness in girls. The ectopic ureter arises from the upper pole of a duplex collecting system, or from a dysplastic kidney. An ultrasound evaluation may suggest this diagnosis, but an intravenous pyelogram is a more sensitive test. Treatment is surgical. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ectopic-ureter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ectopic ureter&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Urethral prolapse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In prepubertal girls, the distal end of the urethra can prolapse either partially (anterior or posterior) or in a complete circumferential (&quot;donut-like&quot;) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F105413\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105413 \">picture 4</a>) fashion. The tissue may be friable and become infected, but rarely becomes necrotic. Children with urethral prolapse present with bleeding, dysuria, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> difficulty with urination. It is important to make sure of the diagnosis because a sarcoma botryoides (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F105414\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105414 \">picture 5</a>) originating in the distal urethra or a prolapsed ureterocele can both be easily confused for urethral prolapse. A pediatric urology consultation may be needed for confirmation of the diagnosis.</p><p>Prepubertal girls with symptomatic urethral prolapse can be treated with topical estrogen therapy (eg, Premarin cream or Estrace cream 0.01%) similar to postmenopausal women with this problem. Sitz baths twice daily may also be helpful. Topical estrogen cream is applied twice daily after the sitz bath for two weeks, then the urethra is reassessed and treatment is continued if the prolapse has not resolved and is still present. The prolapse will usually resolve within a few weeks of topical estrogen treatment but can sometimes take longer. Rarely, the distal urethra can be necrotic, and if so, it may require surgery. If there is persistence of the prolapse, assessment for a urethral polyp may be indicated.

Inflammation of the labia minora combined with low estrogen in prepubertal girls provides one possible explanation for adhesions, especially in the setting of poor perineal hygiene, trauma (eg, straddle injury, female genital mutilation, or sexual abuse), vaginal infection (eg, <em>Candida</em>, Group A <em>Streptococcus</em>, <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae, or </em>herpes simplex virus), or lichen sclerosis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Clinical findings</strong> &ndash; Labial adhesions are diagnosed on a routine genital examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vulvovaginal-complaints-in-the-prepubertal-child/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. They can be partial, involving only the upper or lower labia, or complete (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F104743\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef104743 \">picture 9</a>). In patients with complete adhesions, a small pinhole orifice may be present that functions as a means for urine to exit from behind the fused labia. Labial adhesions may be asymptomatic or cause a pulling sensation, difficulty with urination, vaginal pain or discharge, recurrent urinary tract infections, or recurrent vaginal infections.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Management</strong> &ndash; The management of labial adhesions is determined by the presence and degree of symptoms as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vulvovaginal-complaints-in-the-prepubertal-child/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Asymptomatic</strong> &ndash; No treatment is necessary if the adhesions are asymptomatic, involve only a small portion of the labia, and are not affecting the urine stream. The adhesions may resolve when estrogen production increases at puberty.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Symptomatic</strong> &ndash; Labial adhesions should be treated if they affect urination by diverting a normal stream of urine or are associated with recurrent infections or pain as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vulvovaginal-complaints-in-the-prepubertal-child/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. We recommend initial treatment of symptomatic labial adhesions with topical medications (eg, estrogen, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">estradiol</a> cream or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">betamethasone</a> cream) rather than manual separation or surgery:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span><strong>Topical estrogen or </strong><a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">estradiol</a><strong> therapy</strong> &ndash; The most common treatment consists of topical estrogen or estradiol cream (eg, Premarin cream or Estrace cream 0.01%) applied twice daily using a fingertip or rarely a Q-tip at the point of midline fusion where there is a thin white line [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vulvovaginal-complaints-in-the-prepubertal-child/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. With the application of the estrogen cream, great care should be taken so as not to traumatically tear the adhesion. Therapy is continued until the labial adhesions resolve. The most common reason for medical failure is placement of the cream in the wrong location or placement of too small an amount of cream.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\">Side effects are uncommon and include irritation, redness, vulvar hyperpigmentation, minimal vaginal bleeding, and breast bud formation. Local effects may be managed by ensuring proper application and limiting the duration of estrogen or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">estradiol</a> treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vulvovaginal-complaints-in-the-prepubertal-child/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Breast bud formation and vaginal bleeding resolve after the cessation of the topical estrogen cream. This complication is less likely if the cream is applied sparingly and directly to the adhesion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\">The response of labial adhesions to topical estrogen therapy was illustrated in a retrospective review of 109 girls (three months to 10 years of age) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vulvovaginal-complaints-in-the-prepubertal-child/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Topical estrogen therapy was successful in 79 percent of patients after a mean duration of four months. Minimal breast development occurred in six girls (5 percent), and scant vaginal bleeding in one (&lt;1 percent). In our experience, labial adhesions resolve in nearly all girls treated with correct technique for two to six weeks. Successful separation should be followed by attention to hygiene, daily baths, and the application of a bland ointment, such as A&amp;D Ointment or white petroleum jelly, for 6 to 12 months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span><strong>Topical </strong><a href=\"topic.htm?path=betamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">betamethasone</a><strong> 0.05%</strong> &ndash; Topical betamethasone 0.05% has been suggested as an alternative or adjunctive topical therapy for labial adhesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vulvovaginal-complaints-in-the-prepubertal-child/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Several studies have reported efficacy of 68 to 89 percent with the use of betamethasone 0.05% cream twice daily for four to six weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vulvovaginal-complaints-in-the-prepubertal-child/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>], while another study reported 16 percent success, low but similar to their success rate with estrogen cream [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vulvovaginal-complaints-in-the-prepubertal-child/abstract/24,25,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25,27</a>].

In another study in which 19 girls received treatment with betamethasone, 15 (79 percent) had resolution which was reported to occur more rapidly than with estrogen cream (1.3 versus 2.2 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vulvovaginal-complaints-in-the-prepubertal-child/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\">Although we continue to use primarily estrogen creams, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">betamethasone</a> topical therapy is another option as primary, secondary or adjunctive therapy. If betamethasone is used, care must be taken to avoid prolonged use (greater than three months) to prevent skin atrophy and systemic corticosteroid absorption. Topical betamethasone is a reasonable choice for patients who fail initial estrogen treatment as an alternative to manual separation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span><strong>Manual or surgical separation</strong> &ndash; Manual or surgical separation of adhesions is <strong>rarely</strong> indicated and reserved for patients who have severe obstruction to urinary flow with retention or recurrent infections. Failure of medical therapy tends to occur with thick adhesions (3 to 4 mm in width) with no thin translucent raphe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vulvovaginal-complaints-in-the-prepubertal-child/abstract/21,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,28,29</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\">Manual separation should <strong>only</strong> be performed by physicians experienced with the technique. Local analgesia and, depending upon the degree of adhesion and level of patient concern, sedation or general anesthesia, should accompany the procedure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selection-of-medications-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room#H2253115\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selection of medications for pediatric procedural sedation outside of the operating room&quot;, section on 'Minimally painful procedures'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\">Manual separation may be performed in the office with cooperative patients. Application of topical anesthetic (eg, topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lidocaine</a>) and mild sedation, as needed, is followed by insertion of a lubricated Q-tip behind the labia minora [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vulvovaginal-complaints-in-the-prepubertal-child/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The Q-tip is then gently pulled forward along the midline raphe formed by the fused labia minora.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\">Surgical intervention by a pediatric gynecologist or urologist for labial adhesions is reserved for rare patients with complete obstruction of urine flow and for those in whom estrogen cream cannot be applied for psychosocial reasons or has been unsuccessful after an adequate trial (as described above). With these indications, the authors have performed only one surgical separation in the past 10 years. When necessary, surgical separation is performed with sedation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anesthesia and followed by topical estrogen cream for one to two weeks and then application of a bland emollient (eg, white petroleum jelly) for 6 to 12 months.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Trauma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vulvar trauma can cause significant bleeding because the area is highly vascular and children do not have mature labia with fat pads, which protect the vulvar area of adults.

The history must correlate with the physical findings to confirm nonsexual trauma. If a child has a straddle injury, she will most likely have an injury to the anterior area of the vulva, including the mons, clitoral hood, and anterior aspect of the labia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F70056%7EEM%2F78842%7EEM%2F60772%7EEM%2F68436%7EEM%2F79041\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70056 graphicRef78842 graphicRef60772 graphicRef68436 graphicRef79041 \">picture 10A-E</a>). An injury to the posterior fourchette and hymenal area suggest possible sexual abuse. As an example, a laceration to the lower half of the hymenal area (using a clock, the location would be three o'clock to nine o'clock) is consistent with a penetrating injury and must be further explored (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F50009%7EEM%2F62823\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50009 graphicRef62823 \">picture 11A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vulvovaginal-complaints-in-the-prepubertal-child/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].
