In susceptible individuals, this can lead to misuse, substance use <span class=\"nowrap\">disorders/addiction,</span> and other serious consequences. It has led to the development of an illicit market for these medications. </p><p>Despite government regulation of these medications, prescription drug misuse and its consequences have persisted and increased.
