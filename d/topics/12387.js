In most cases, renal pelvic dilation is a transient physiologic state, however, congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) can present with fetal hydronephrosis due to urinary tract obstruction and vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). These conditions may be associated with impaired renal development <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cause renal injury.</p><p>Nevertheless, the majority of cases of fetal hydronephrosis are not clinically significant, and therefore excessive concern may lead to unnecessary testing of the newborn infant and anxiety for parents and health care providers. The goal of prenatal management is to detect those cases of fetal hydronephrosis that may adversely affect the health of the infant and require antenatal and postnatal evaluation, timely referral to a pediatric urologist if required, and possible intervention to minimize adverse outcomes, while limiting testing in those cases that are due to a benign, transient condition.</p><p>The definition, etiology, and management of fetal hydronephrosis are reviewed here. Postnatal evaluation of fetal hydronephrosis and specific urologic conditions that may present as fetal hydronephrosis are discussed separately.

Fetal hydronephrosis is graded according to the RPD during the second <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> third trimester of pregnancy. RPD is a measure of collecting system dilation and does not reflect the extent of hydronephrosis and parenchymal changes, such as increased echogenicity, thinning, or caliectasis. Varying the minimal RPD threshold for normal can significantly alter the positive predictive value of RPD as a measure of postnatal pathology. Lower cutoffs will be more sensitive in detecting postnatal pathology; however, the trade-off is in higher false-positive rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fetal-hydronephrosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Several studies have established normative values for fetal renal size based upon gestational age (GA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fetal-hydronephrosis/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].

As a result, we do not suggest that percutaneous vesicoamniotic shunting be routinely performed in fetuses with lower urinary tract obstruction. If antenatal intervention is performed, it should only be performed in select centers with expertise after careful counseling of parents on the risk and benefits of the procedure, and available information on the neonatal survival and renal outcome.
