There is at least one major factor that distinguishes the administration of blood in a home setting from transfusion in a hospital or other health care facility: the decreased availability of emergency medical care and immediate diagnostic tests should a potentially serious complication occur. This inherent difference compounds the known risks of transfusion.</p><p>An additional safety concern is the possibility that blood could be administered to the wrong patient and result in a hemolytic transfusion reaction. Mistransfusion has been well documented in tertiary care centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-path-to-safer-home-transfusion-standard-operating-procedures/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. Causes range from mislabeling of the pre-transfusion specimen to administration of blood to a patient wearing either the wrong identification band or none at all. Any of these errors can occur in a home transfusion setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-acute-transfusion-reaction#H6713959\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with a suspected acute transfusion reaction&quot;, section on 'Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction (AHTR)'</a>.)</p><p>Transfusion safety derives from the development of standard operating procedures (SOPs) based on applicable regulations and blood banking standards; training and proficiency of personnel who transfuse; and adherence to written procedures. Writing or reading transfusion SOPs may not be a particularly interesting aspect of the transfusion process, but SOPs provide a procedural foundation for transfusion safety. Because non-tertiary hospital facilities and agencies have shown interest in out-of-hospital transfusions, this article offers information to assist in the development of SOPs for home transfusion.</p><p>Procedures for the main activities associated with home transfusion and general content will be reviewed here. This document is intended to provide broad guidelines; a comprehensive discussion of all possible procedural details is beyond the scope of this overview. Additional information is available in several reviews [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-path-to-safer-home-transfusion-standard-operating-procedures/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The AABB (formerly the American Association of Blood Banks) is an international authority on transfusion practices and procedures and publishes an excellent resource for transfusion medicine and blood banking, the AABB Technical Manual, which is regularly updated, as are the AABB standards for Blood Banks and Transfusion Services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-path-to-safer-home-transfusion-standard-operating-procedures/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Standards for out of hospital transfusion are under development by the AABB. The Compendium of Transfusion Practices, 3<sup>rd</sup> Edition, is a concise transfusion medicine resource published by the American Red Cross [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-path-to-safer-home-transfusion-standard-operating-procedures/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>The general principles of home transfusion, including the patient profile, exclusion criteria, the physician's and nurse's roles, and management of transfusion reactions are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-home-blood-transfusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of home blood transfusion&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunologic-transfusion-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunologic transfusion reactions&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">COLLECTION AND LABELING OF PRE-TRANSFUSION SPECIMENS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This SOP defines steps for performing necessary pre-transfusion functions. These include obtaining specimens for pre-transfusion compatibility testing and establishing a means of identifying the patient. This SOP (or a separate one) should also provide instructions for obtaining informed consent.</p><p>The health care professional administering blood is optimally the individual responsible for obtaining informed consent, putting identification on the patient (usually a wristband or other band), and collecting pre-transfusion specimens. As in other pre-transfusion settings, the appropriate specimens and specific tubes required by the blood bank for performing tests of record should be collected within three days of the anticipated transfusion. Tubes should be labeled with the patient's name, two independent identifiers, the date of birth or medical record number, the date and time of collection, and the initials or name of the transfusionist. The labels should be attached to the tubes before the health care professional leaves the patient's bedside, and labels for other patients should not be taken into the patient's house or facility room. If a specimen does not meet labeling requirements, the SOP should state that it should be rejected and a new one, which conforms to requirements, obtained. If these specifications are not met, the blood bank issuing the blood should not accept it, and the issuing of blood could be delayed.</p><p>Patient identification such as a wristband should legibly show the patient's full name and at least two alphanumeric or numeric identifiers or two independent identifiers. The identifier(s) on the wristband must be identical to those on the pre-transfusion specimens. All of the above steps and activities should appear in the SOP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SITE ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An SOP must be developed that lists other activities that should occur in the initial visit to the patient's home. This procedure should require the transfusionist to determine if the home has a working landline or cell phone with a good signal, and assure that another responsible adult will be present during the transfusion. The area of the home in which the transfusion will be given should be accessible to emergency personnel. These requirements are intended to ensure that the transfusionist has assistance in carrying out the appropriate document checks and contacting help if a complication arises.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ISSUING OF BLOOD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This SOP should specify the type and amount of each component that will be ordered by the physician and accepted by the transfusing agency for transfusion. This process should be coordinated with the local blood provider. Transfusion should be done within the context of a Patient Blood Management program or at least be based on evidence-based component therapy guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-path-to-safer-home-transfusion-standard-operating-procedures/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>The following sections describe suggested approaches for specific components that may be transfused in the home setting. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Packed red blood cells and plasma'</a> below and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Platelets'</a> below and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Cryoprecipitate'</a> below and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Leukoreduction'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Packed red blood cells and plasma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient's physician should base the number of ordered units on their assessment of the patient's volume status and volume tolerance. However, no more than two units of each type of component should be issued per transfusion episode. If packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and plasma are issued simultaneously, only one unit of PRBCs and one unit of plasma should be issued, for example. These limits are recommended to minimize the risk of transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-plasma-components#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of plasma components&quot;, section on 'Plasma products'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-associated-circulatory-overload-taco\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult#H3996125012\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications and hemoglobin thresholds for red blood cell transfusion in the adult&quot;, section on 'Society guidelines'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Platelets</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Apheresis platelets (also known as &quot;single donor platelets&quot;) are obtained from one donor using an automated cell separation device. This product reduces the recipient's exposure to allogeneic donor blood to a greater degree than pooled whole blood-derived platelet concentrates (PWBDPC), which usually contain platelets from more than one donor. If PWBDPCs are used, the ordering physician should ascertain in advance how many platelet concentrates are in each pool, as that will affect the final volume of the product. If apheresis platelets are used, no more than two units should be issued per transfusion episode. Depending on the local blood provider, apheresis platelets are now also available as platelet additive solution (PAS) platelets, in which the plasma volume has been reduced by approximately 65 percent, decreasing the risk of minor allergic and febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions; and pathogen-reduced (PR) platelets, which have undergone a pathogen inactivation process to reduce the risk of contamination with viruses, parasites, and most bacteria. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-and-laboratory-aspects-of-platelet-transfusion-therapy#H558382031\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical and laboratory aspects of platelet transfusion therapy&quot;, section on 'Platelet collection'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Cryoprecipitate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cryoprecipitate can be administered in a home setting for patients with an isolated factor deficiency when a purified factor product is not available (eg, factor XIII deficiency when <a href=\"topic.htm?path=factor-xiii-concentrate-from-human-plasma-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">factor XIII concentrate</a> is not available). Because the volume of one unit is low (approximately 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/unit),</span> use of 10 to 15 pooled units may not pose significant risk of fluid overload. However, the intended dose should be calculated so that the number of units that should be ordered can be determined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-path-to-safer-home-transfusion-standard-operating-procedures/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-cryoprecipitate\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of Cryoprecipitate&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In keeping with standard practices, when components are released, sign-out should be performed by qualified laboratory personnel and the party responsible for transporting and transfusing the products.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Leukoreduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is standard practice for blood centers to issue red cell and platelet units that are already leukoreduced. Pre-storage leukoreduction can prevent the occurrence of febrile, nonhemolytic transfusion reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-path-to-safer-home-transfusion-standard-operating-procedures/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This is especially important in a non-hospital setting because, if such a reaction does occur, a transfusion would be discontinued and the patient's therapy delayed. The use of leukoreduced products will prevent other complications such as possible immunologic reactions associated with residual white blood cells present in cellular blood products. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leukoreduction-to-prevent-complications-of-blood-transfusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Leukoreduction to prevent complications of blood transfusion&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Rarely, blood may be collected and issued by a smaller facility that does not perform leukoreduction of red cells or whole blood from which red cells are prepared. In such cases, bedside leukofiltration could conceivably occur in a home transfusion setting. For such circumstances, the transfusionists should be trained in proper use of the bedside leukocyte filter, and a mechanism for ensuring proper use and quality assurance should be developed.</p><p>For bedside leukoreduction, the transfusionist should be aware of reports of hypotensive reactions observed in association with bedside leukoreduction filters, as there are over 80 reports of patients developing significant hypotensive events while receiving blood products, especially platelets, transfused through a bedside leukoreduction filter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-path-to-safer-home-transfusion-standard-operating-procedures/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Hypotension typically resolves when the transfusion is stopped. Because of concern about this complication, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a series of recommendations, dated May 4, 1999, which included the preferred use of blood products that are leukoreduced at the time of collection or during laboratory storage whenever feasible. Additional information concerning FDA action on this issue can be obtained from the FDA <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/downloads/BiologicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/Blood/UCM320641.pdf&amp;token=ecGcD3HcEC4YY7tjUuA0D4IoNtlIhH3DCVCGFI+li4Yi4zuYdpd3OQoeAOEIapPEjKi2M/Uhqp2bRkvNJsJ/vMeZQtq4NMhG/FgawIXvhtJKxKCZaHq6h2+NPnzco/WHPH6xAlfmA2HgIiQ9B8AgMyLL0bwaMTUR4tlI/++hHeo=&amp;TOPIC_ID=7917\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">website</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-path-to-safer-home-transfusion-standard-operating-procedures/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Although these kinds of reactions are reported infrequently, isolated cases apparently do occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-path-to-safer-home-transfusion-standard-operating-procedures/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSPORTING AND STORING BLOOD COMPONENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transporting and storing blood for use in a non-hospital setting may present a unique challenge because transport to a patient's home or other non-tertiary hospital facility may involve more time or unpredictable conditions than would normally be encountered in a tertiary care center. The SOP should specify how the units will be protected and maintained at an appropriate temperature.</p><p>In the United States, the transport of blood falls under regulations of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the issuing facility should validate its shipping procedures and devices to meet FDA requirements. Validation involves simulations that test the shipping system to guarantee that products will be delivered intact and remain within acceptable temperature ranges.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Red cell units should be packed with a coolant that maintains a 1 to 10&deg;C temperature range.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Platelets can be maintained at the required 20 to 24&deg;C range by shipping them at room temperature (for short distances) or by packing them with commercially available thermostable material.</p><p/><p>Measurement of the temperature within the transport device upon opening the container may provide additional assurance that proper temperatures have been maintained. The issuing center may assist by either placing a thermometer in close proximity to the components or by applying a colorimetric temperature sensitive device on the component. An example of such a device is the Hemotemp II Blood Bag Temperature indicator, which changes from blue to non-blue when the temperature of a red cell unit exceeds 10&deg;C. Portable temperature monitors are also available for platelets. Manufacturers' instructions should be followed when using such devices.</p><p>The SOP should also state that upon delivery to the final destination, the transporting container should not be opened until preparations for transfusion have been completed, and that it should be opened only by the tranfusionist. Under no circumstances should a component be placed in a home refrigerator or an unmonitored refrigerator, even one in a physician's office, a skilled nursing or rehabilitation facility, or other facility that may have refrigerators for storing pharmaceutical products. After the shipping container is opened, the transfusionist should document the temperature if a temperature-monitoring device is in the transporter.</p><p>The SOP for transport should specify that if the indicator shows a temperature not in compliance with applicable regulations and standards, the issuing blood center should be contacted immediately for instructions that may include that the products be returned untransfused to the issuing facility. If the blood center cannot be contacted, the unit should not be transfused. Although the issuing blood center should have inspected the blood or platelets for defects prior to issue, the transfusionist should also inspect the units for defects such as leakage, breakage, non-adherent label or tie tag, or abnormal appearance of the blood products.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT IDENTIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The SOP for this procedure is one of the most important in the home transfusion process. Failure of the procedure to accurately detail all steps or failure to follow procedures could result in the same potentially deleterious outcomes that can occur when blood is erroneously transfused to the wrong patient in a hospital setting. The one-to-one nurse-patient ratio found in home care or other settings is no insurance against such an error.</p><p>The identification process in the home transfusion setting is distinctly dissimilar from that which takes place in the hospital because another nurse is usually not available to assist with the patient's identification and check and review relevant documents and labels. Nevertheless, patient identification procedures should involve two people, one of whom is <strong>not</strong> the patient, which is also why it is necessary that there be another responsible adult on site.</p><p>Immediately prior to the transfusion, the transfusionist and other adult in attendance should carry out what is referred to as a &quot;bedside clerical check.&quot; In this procedure, the patient's identification band (which should have been applied in an earlier home visit and still be on the patient and legible) is checked for accuracy and compared to the patient's name and identification numbers that are affixed to the component and also listed on accompanying blood bank paperwork. This information should be compared item by item. If alert and oriented, the patient should be asked to clearly state their name. If inconsistencies exist in any of these steps, the issuing facility should be contacted and may instruct that the blood be returned untransfused.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSFUSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This SOP should detail patient monitoring and logistics associated with the actual transfusion. It should state the instructions that the patient must receive prior to the transfusion, especially to report any change in physical sensation or condition during the transfusion. It should outline how often the patient's temperature and vital signs should be taken and recorded. Suggestion minimums are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immediately beforehand</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Every 15 minutes for the first hour</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Every 30 minutes thereafter</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>15 to 30 minutes after the transfusion is complete</p><p/><p>The transfusionist may make these assessments more frequently.</p><p>The patient should also be observed during and after transfusion for signs or symptoms of a reaction.</p><p>The procedure should also specify what type of infusion tubing and standard infusion filter are used, whether or not a leukoreduction filter is needed, and the type of infusing solution. The procedure should clearly state that the only solution acceptable for transfusion in this setting is sterile physiologic saline. Other supplies such as medications and equipment (eg, appropriate-gauge needles) and their proper use should be listed. All supplies and equipment should be used as intended and in accordance with manufacturers' instructions and applicable regulations.</p><p>The maximum amount of time &ndash; four hours &ndash; during which the infusion takes place needs to be stated. Although no minimum amount of time for transfusing a component is suggested in the literature, the procedure should state that an infusion rate appropriate for the patient's age, cardiovascular status, and other underlying medical conditions, be determined by the ordering physician.</p><p>The proper disposal of used blood bags, tubing, needles, and other detritus should be addressed in this or a separate procedure. Any items that could potentially be contaminated with blood should <strong>not</strong> be discarded in the patient's home. Needles and other sharp devices with the potential to cause injuries should receive special mention, and a sharps container should be used. If the transfusing agency does not have an appropriate means for disposing of waste products, one possible approach is to return these materials to the issuing facility for disposal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is critical that the transfusion complications SOP contain specific and complete information for recognizing and managing adverse events in the peri-transfusion period. Transfusing personnel should be trained, routinely undergo competency assessment, and be fully knowledgeable with this and all other applicable procedures. Some complications require pharmacologic intervention, so the SOP should list medications, method of administration, dose, and the indications for each medication that may need to be administered. It should also specify the circumstances under which a medication should be given without prior approval from the attending physician, for example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> for anaphylaxis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-home-blood-transfusion#H13626751\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of home blood transfusion&quot;, section on 'Management of reactions'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">FORMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is helpful and most likely necessary to develop SOP companion forms. Examples include documents for informed consent, a transfusion locale assessment checklist, supplies and materials, the transfusion report, and post-transfusion patient instructions. Useful prototypes of these are found in the AABB monograph, Out-of-Hospital Transfusion Therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-path-to-safer-home-transfusion-standard-operating-procedures/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">VALIDATION AND REVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In conformance with regulations, SOPs should be tested and stressed in simulations prior to implementation. This activity, referred to as validation, can identify flaws or omissions. SOPs should be periodically updated to incorporate new or revised regulations and standards.</p><p>For practitioners, transfusionists, or home health care agencies that have not been previously involved in transfusion-related procedure development, it is advised that input from transfusion medicine specialists be obtained prior to and after writing procedures. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Writing and validating standardized operating procedures (SOPs) for home transfusion are not guarantees of transfusion safety.
