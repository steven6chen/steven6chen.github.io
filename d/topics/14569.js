In a questionnaire survey of 5600 individuals with psoriasis (median age 44 years, range 1 to 92 years), approximately one-third reported onset of disease during the first two decades of life and 10 percent reported onset prior to the age of 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriasis-in-children-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>The prevalence of psoriasis varies geographically. Worldwide, prevalence estimates range from 0.51 to 11.3 percent of adults and 0 to 1.37 percent of children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriasis-in-children-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Psoriasis is more frequent in older children than young children. A review of data from 1.3 million individuals within a German statutory health insurance organization found an approximately linear increase in the proportion of patients with a diagnosis of psoriasis from 0.12 percent at age 1 year to 1.24 percent at age 18 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriasis-in-children-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>As in adults, the incidence of psoriasis in children has increased over time. A population-based study in Olmstead County, Minnesota, found that the incidence of pediatric psoriasis doubled between the periods of 1970 to 1974 and 1995 to 1999 (29.6 per 100,000 to 62.7 per 100,000, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriasis-in-children-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The rising prevalence of obesity, a risk factor for psoriasis, may contribute to this finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriasis-in-children-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1677922712\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A complex interplay of environmental and genetic factors contributes to risk for psoriasis. A family history of psoriasis is a common risk factor; in a multicenter study of 409 children with psoriasis, approximately 30 percent reported an immediate family member with psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriasis-in-children-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>The most common predisposing genetic risk factor for early-onset psoriasis (onset under the age of 40 years) is the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type Cw6 (<em>PSOR1</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriasis-in-children-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Less common is a pathogenic mutation in <em>CARD14</em> (caspase recruitment domain family 14; <em>PSOR2</em>), which is transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion and may manifest as pityriasis rubra pilaris, erythrodermic psoriasis, pustular psoriasis, or plaque psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriasis-in-children-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. </p><p>Multiple environmental factors may trigger or exacerbate psoriasis. Examples include skin trauma (Koebner phenomenon), infections (eg, streptococcal [most common], staphylococcal, and varicella zoster infections), Kawasaki disease, certain medications, and psychologic and physical stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriasis-in-children-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-14</a>]. </p><p>Greater detail on the genetic and environmental risk factors for psoriasis is provided separately.

Activation of myeloid dendritic cells by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interferon-gamma, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1-beta stimulates the adaptive immune system via IL-23. The adaptive immune response is characterized by expression of primarily Th17 and <span class=\"nowrap\">TNF/IL-17</span> synergistic cytokines, in contrast to the Th2 response that predominates in atopic dermatitis. These proinflammatory cytokines stimulate further release of inflammatory mediators (including TNF) from keratinocytes, perpetuating the immune activation and resulting in the brightly erythematous, scaly plaques of psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriasis-in-children-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. The pathophysiology of psoriasis is reviewed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-psoriasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of psoriasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2354675065\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classic erythematous and scaly plaques of psoriasis can occur in various forms and distributions. The major clinical variants of psoriasis include chronic plaque psoriasis, guttate psoriasis, pustular psoriasis, and erythrodermic psoriasis. In addition, certain distributions of psoriasis are more common in children than in adults, including face, scalp, intertriginous, and diaper area involvement. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4258687128\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic plaque psoriasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic plaque psoriasis is the most common presentation of psoriasis in both children and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriasis-in-children-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. The classic cutaneous findings are round, brightly erythematous, well-demarcated plaques covered with silvery-white (mica-like or &quot;micaceous&quot;) scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F113134%7EDERM%2F113135%7EDERM%2F113322%7EDERM%2F113142\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113134 graphicRef113135 graphicRef113322 graphicRef113142 \">picture 1A-D</a>). Children may also present with plaques with less distinct borders or thinner scale. In patients with highly pigmented skin (Fitzpatrick skin type V or VI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60541\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60541 \">table 1</a>)), erythema may not be prominent and plaques may appear violaceous or hyperpigmented rather than erythematous.</p><p>Plaque psoriasis may present with few plaques or in a more generalized distribution, but the distribution is often symmetric. As in adults, the elbows and knees are the most common sites for chronic plaque psoriasis. Other common areas of involvement include the scalp, lower back, and the anogenital region. Formation of psoriasis plaques in sites of cutaneous trauma, termed the &quot;Koebner phenomenon,&quot; is also characteristic.

In a multicenter study of 181 children with psoriasis, approximately 30 percent had a history of a guttate presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriasis-in-children-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Guttate psoriasis is characterized by the acute and generalized eruption of small, round, erythematous, and &quot;drop-like&quot; scaly papules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F113136\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113136 \">picture 2</a>). As with chronic plaque psoriasis, plaques may appear violaceous or hyperpigmented in patients with darkly pigmented skin. Guttate psoriasis often occurs in association with group A streptococcal infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guttate-psoriasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guttate psoriasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H492151817\"><span class=\"h2\">Pustular and erythrodermic psoriasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Generalized pustular psoriasis and erythrodermic psoriasis are severe forms of psoriasis. These variants are rare in children.</p><p>Generalized pustular psoriasis is characterized by a generalized acute or subacute annular eruption of erythematous, thin plaques with numerous discrete pustules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F113137\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113137 \">picture 3</a>). Children can present with pustules on preexisting psoriatic plaques or, more commonly, on previously normal skin. The pustules are usually sterile but can become secondarily infected. The pustules progress to crusts, and patients with acute disease ultimately progress to generalized erythroderma and exfoliation. Nail and mucous membrane involvement is not uncommon. Hospitalization is often required for acute generalized pustular psoriasis due to associated abnormalities in temperature regulation and cardiovascular stability. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pustular-psoriasis-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pustular psoriasis: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pustular psoriasis may also present with involvement limited to the palms and soles (pustulosis palmaris et plantaris) or intertriginous distribution that begins in infancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriasis-in-children-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Pustular psoriasis in infancy, especially when there is associated sterile osteomyelitis or periostitis, should raise suspicion for abnormalities of interleukin (IL)-1 (deficiency of IL-1 receptor antagonist [DIRA]) or IL-36 (deficiency of IL-36 receptor antagonist [DITRA]), rare autosomal recessive disorders that present with pustular psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriasis-in-children-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-26</a>]. Pustular psoriasis is also a less common manifestation of a <em>CARD14</em> mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriasis-in-children-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>The presentation of erythrodermic psoriasis overlaps with pustular psoriasis. Erythrodermic psoriasis is characterized by widespread cutaneous erythema and associated scale and exfoliation.

Scalp psoriasis is more common in girls than boys, which may be secondary to the Koebner phenomenon (lesion development in sites of skin trauma) induced by frequent combing, brushing, or vigorous shampooing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriasis-in-children-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Well-demarcated, erythematous, scaly plaques are typical, although the plaques may also have a salmon-colored, greasy appearance similar to seborrheic dermatitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F113138\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113138 \">picture 4</a>). While seborrheic dermatitis tends to remain within the hairline, psoriasis plaques often extend beyond the hairline to the upper forehead, pre- and postauricular skin, and nuchal areas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F113139\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113139 \">picture 5</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inverse psoriasis</strong> &ndash; Inverse psoriasis occurs more frequently in the pediatric population than in adults.

Plaques may appear violaceous or hyperpigmented rather than erythematous in these patients. </p><p>Certain features strongly suggest specific clinical forms of psoriasis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chronic plaque psoriasis:</strong> Presents with erythematous plaques with micaceous scale and sharply demarcated borders, often involving sites such as the elbows, knees, scalp, or lower back (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F113134%7EDERM%2F113135%7EDERM%2F113142\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113134 graphicRef113135 graphicRef113142 \">picture 1A-B, 1D</a>). Children may also exhibit plaques with thinner scale or less distinct borders. Removal of scale from plaques often results in pinpoint areas of bleeding (Auspitz sign). Facial, intertriginous, and diaper-area involvement are also common in children; however, scale may be minimal or absent in these areas. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Guttate psoriasis:</strong> Presents with numerous, small, &quot;drop-like,&quot; erythematous papules and plaques, particularly when involving the trunk and proximal extremities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F113136\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113136 \">picture 2</a>). Plaques are erythematous. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Generalized pustular psoriasis and erythrodermic psoriasis:</strong> Acute generalized pustular psoriasis presents with widespread erythema, pustules, and scale. Erythrodermic psoriasis presents with widespread erythema and scale.

When the diagnosis is in question, however, a confirmatory biopsy can be performed; this is most often necessary with pustular psoriasis. The histologic findings of psoriasis include epidermal thickening, retention of nuclei in the stratum corneum (parakeratosis), and a mononuclear infiltrate with collections of neutrophils in the stratum corneum <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> subcorneal layer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1330026472\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of psoriasis includes atopic dermatitis as well as other papulosquamous disorders that can occur in children. Most often, the history and physical examination are sufficient to distinguish psoriasis from these conditions, but a skin biopsy can be helpful in ambiguous presentations.</p><p>Disorders commonly in the differential diagnosis of guttate and plaque psoriasis include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Atopic dermatitis</strong> &ndash; Atopic dermatitis is common in children. In infants, atopic dermatitis often manifests as erythematous, scaly patches on the face, extensor surfaces, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> scalp (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F102395\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef102395 \">picture 9</a>). The diaper area is usually spared (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F68746\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68746 \">picture 10</a>). Older children usually have erythematous patches or lichenified plaques in flexural areas (eg, antecubital and popliteal fossae, volar wrists, ankles, or neck). Occasionally, children present with an overlap of atopic dermatitis and psoriasis, consisting of lesions with intermediate morphology or the presence of lesions characteristic of each condition, which can complicate a clinical diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriasis-in-children-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The plaques of psoriasis tend to be more well-defined and less pruritic than those of atopic dermatitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atopic-dermatitis-eczema-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atopic dermatitis (eczema): Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pityriasis rosea </strong>&ndash; Pityriasis rosea is a benign, self-limited disorder that may be confused with guttate psoriasis. Pityriasis rosea often begins with a single lesion (&quot;herald patch&quot;) followed by a secondary eruption. The herald patch tends to be a well-demarcated, scaly patch on the trunk, upper arm, neck, or thigh with a slightly elevated outer border. The secondary eruption consists of smaller, often pruritic papules with a collarette of scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F57568%7EDERM%2F98332\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57568 graphicRef98332 \">picture 11A-B</a>). The papules most often occur in a characteristic &quot;Christmas tree&quot; distribution on the trunk, usually sparing the face and distal extremities. Spontaneous resolution usually occurs within a few months. The histopathologic features of pityriasis rosea are not diagnostic, but the characteristic distribution and natural history helps to distinguish this condition from guttate psoriasis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pityriasis-rosea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pityriasis rosea&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pityriasis lichenoides chronica </strong>&ndash; Pityriasis lichenoides chronica (PLC) is rare inflammatory skin condition, which is part of the spectrum of pityriasis lichenoides. PLC can develop de novo or progress from pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta (PLEVA). Clinically, PLC consists of multiple and diffuse, scaly, erythematous to brown papules and plaques that remit (with residual dyspigmentation) and relapse over months to years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F89406\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89406 \">picture 12</a>). Unlike psoriasis, PLC tends not to improve with topical corticosteroids but may resolve with systemic antibiotic therapy. Histopathologic evaluation of biopsy specimens can further distinguish PLC from psoriasis if clinical assessment is insufficient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pityriasis-lichenoides-chronica\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pityriasis lichenoides chronica&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pityriasis rubra pilaris</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP) is a skin condition typically characterized by follicular papules coalescing into hyperkeratotic plaques and accompanied by salmon-colored palmoplantar keratoderma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F113143%7EDERM%2F87153%7EDERM%2F95658\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113143 graphicRef87153 graphicRef95658 \">picture 13A-C</a>). The clinical course varies from resolution within 6 to 12 months to a more protracted course, with remissions and exacerbations similar to psoriasis. When unable to distinguish psoriasis and PRP morphologically, pathology can be helpful. Biopsy of follicular-based PRP lesions reveals follicular keratosis, alternating epidermal parakeratosis and orthokeratosis, and dermal mononuclear cell infiltrates. Some patients may at times show features of PRP and at other times psoriasis; it is possible that these patients harbor a heterozygous mutation in <em>CARD14</em>, which may variably manifest as PRP, psoriasis, or erythrodermic psoriasis with pustules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriasis-in-children-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pityriasis-rubra-pilaris\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pityriasis rubra pilaris&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The differential diagnosis of localized and generalized pustular psoriasis includes other pustular disorders that can occur in children, such as infectious pustulosis, eosinophilic pustular folliculitis in infants, and infantile acropustulosis. A culture can distinguish infectious pustulosis from the sterile pustules of pustular psoriasis. Eosinophilic pustular folliculitis in infancy typically begins within the first few weeks of life and is characterized by recurrent crops of pustules on the scalp and face. Less frequently, other body areas are involved. Acropustulosis of infancy usually begins within the first several months of life and presents with recurrent crops of pruritic vesicles and pustules, with a predilection for acral skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F55499\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55499 \">picture 14</a>). A skin biopsy can help to distinguish eosinophilic folliculitis and infantile acropustulosis from pustular psoriasis when needed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2785220053\"><span class=\"h1\">ADDITIONAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psoriatic arthritis is a common comorbidity of psoriasis.<strong> </strong>Children should be assessed for signs or symptoms of psoriatic arthritis at the time of diagnosis of psoriasis and periodically thereafter. Helpful screening questions include inquiring about joint redness and swelling, limp, and joint pain and stiffness after inactivity. Suggestive clinical findings include oligoarthritis, spinal or sacroiliac arthritis, enthesitis, dactylitis, and uveitis. The diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis in children is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psoriatic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H16092675\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psoriatic juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Given the association of psoriasis with increased risk for other diseases (eg, obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes), clinicians treating children for psoriasis should be cognizant of recognizing children who may benefit from screening for comorbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psoriasis-in-children-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3047082128\" class=\"local\">'Comorbidities'</a> above.)</p><p>Psoriasis can have negative psychosocial effects.

Approximately one-third of adults with psoriasis have a history of disease onset during the first two decades of life. (See <a href=\"#H1088267741\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A complex interplay of environmental and genetic factors contributes to risk for psoriasis. The human leukocyte antigen type Cw6 (<em>PSOR1</em>) is the most common predisposing genetic risk factor for early-onset psoriasis (psoriasis before age 40 years). (See <a href=\"#H1677922712\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major clinical forms of psoriasis are similar in children and adults. Chronic plaque psoriasis is the most common form of psoriasis in children. Guttate, pustular, and erythrodermic psoriasis are less frequent. (See <a href=\"#H2354675065\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic plaque psoriasis is characterized by the presence of well-demarcated, erythematous plaques with silvery-white, mica-like scale.
