Metabolic acidosis results from an underlying primary disease or a disorder. Consequently, a careful history and physical examination is required to diagnosis the underlying condition and direct appropriate evaluation and treatment of the pathophysiologic events that result in metabolic acidosis.</p><p>An approach to the physiology, diagnosis, and treatment of metabolic acidosis in children will be reviewed in this topic.

Acidosis is a manifestation of an underlying disease state. Acidosis can result from a clinical state that lowers the extracellular fluid pH (increase in hydrogen ion concentration) by one of two mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Metabolic acidosis</strong> due to a fall in serum bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub>-) concentration</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Respiratory acidosis</strong> due to an elevation in arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) concentration</p><p/><p>Two other terms used to describe acid-base disorders are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Simple acid-base disorder</strong> &ndash; In patients with either metabolic or respiratory acidosis, compensatory mechanisms are triggered to correct the pH. Simple-base acid disorder is defined as either metabolic or respiratory acidosis with the appropriate compensation. In patients with metabolic acidosis, an increased respiratory response that decreases partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO<sub>2</sub>, which raises the pH) begins within 30 minutes. However, in patients with respiratory acidosis, the renal compensatory response of bicarbonate retention is much slower and may take up to three to five days.
