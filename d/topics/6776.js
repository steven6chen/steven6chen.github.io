Childhood HTN is also divided into two categories depending upon whether or not an underlying cause can be identified (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F101809\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101809 \">table 4</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary HTN &ndash; No identifiable cause is found.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondary HTN &ndash; An underlying cause is identified.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1951123521\"><span class=\"h2\">Rationale</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is good evidence that identifying children with HTN and successfully treating their primary HTN has an important impact on long-term outcomes of CVD. Pediatric data include clinical studies that demonstrate cardiovascular (CV) structural and functional changes in children with HTN, and autopsy studies that have shown an association of blood pressure (BP) with atherosclerotic changes in the aorta and heart of children and young adults. Children with primary HTN are likely to continue to have elevated BP as adults, and multiple randomized trials in adults have shown that reduction of BP by antihypertensive therapy reduces CV morbidity and mortality. The magnitude of the benefit increases with the severity of the HTN. In patients with secondary HTN, clinical outcomes vary depending on the underlying etiology and whether the underlying cause is amenable to treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonemergent-treatment-of-hypertension-in-children-and-adolescents#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonemergent treatment of hypertension in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Rationale for intervention'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-diagnosis-of-hypertension-in-children-and-adolescents#H2358303278\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and diagnosis of hypertension in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Tracking'</a>.)</p><p>Thus, one of the most important components of the successful management of childhood HTN is distinguishing between primary and secondary HTN, and if the latter determining whether there is an underlying cause that is amenable to treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2347051151\"><span class=\"h2\">Goals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of the evaluation of the hypertensive child or adolescent are to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distinguish between primary and secondary HTN (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F101809\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101809 \">table 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children with secondary HTN, identify secondary HTN (ie, an underlying cause of hypertension), which may be cured, thereby avoiding the need for prolonged drug therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73738\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73738 \">table 5</a>).
